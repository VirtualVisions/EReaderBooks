I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: you have truly\nchanged my life. To my editor Michele Eniclerico: thank you so much for your\ninterest in and support of this book, for your astute questions, your insightful\nrestructuring suggestions, and your trust in my judgement. I’m so grateful that\nyou encouraged me to make this a book that speaks to Autistics specifically,\nrather than appeal to a neurotypical gaze. Chapter eight is now the part of the\nbook I’m proudest about having written, and it wouldn’t even be here without\nyour suggestions. Thank you Jeanne Widen at Loyola’s School of Continuing and\nProfessional Studies for always supporting my writerly work and viewing it as a\nworthwhile part of my scholarly identity. You’ve always treated me with such\nwarmth and trust, and I’m incredibly grateful. Thank you to the entire team at\nHarmony for making this book look beautiful and helping me bring it to the\nworld.\n\nSo many Autistic and otherwise neurodivergent writers and thinkers have played\nan integral role in shaping this book: Heather Morgan, James Finn, Jesse\nMeadows, Marta Rose, Keillan Cruickshank, Timotheus Gordon Jr., Jersey Noah, and\nJess White, thank you for every conversation we have shared, all the resources\nyou have created for the community, and all the feedback you have given me.\nAmythest Schaber, Rabbi Ruti Reagan, Jen White-Johnson, Sky Cubacub, Samuel\nDylan Finch, ChrisTiana ObeySumner, Rian Phin, Tiffany Hammond, Anand Prahlad,\nand everyone else I quoted in this book: thank you for everything you have\ncreated. Thank you to everyone who allowed me to interview you for this book, as\nwell as the hundreds of Autistic people online who responded to polls and\nrequests for your thoughts and feedback on my ideas. I tried to take in as many\nAutistic perspectives as possible while writing this book, and I hope that I’ve\nhonored all the stories you have shared with me and treated your generosity with\nthe respect and gratitude it deserves.\n\nThank you to everyone who has helped me feel less broken over the years,\nparticularly every friend who has extended me grace when I didn’t understand\nmyself or how to relate to other people. I’ve done so much to turn myself away\nfrom those who love me, because I was so consumed with doubt and fear, but your\nlove and honesty have been my touchstones. Thank you to every Autistic and\nneurodivergent friend who has come out to me since I started writing about my\nown disability, giving us both a wonderful opportunity to trade life hacks and\ncommiserate. Thanks to my family for always allowing me to be my own person, and\nto speak from my own experience without ever trying to stifle my voice. To all\nmy friends on the Dump Truck Discord server, thank you for keeping me feeling\nrelatively stable and truly connected during the pandemic. Finally, thank you to\nNick for dimming the lights, giving me excuses to leave busy functions,\nconstructing a sensory overwhelm panic room under the bed, and plugging in your\nheadphones when the chess.com sound effects get too painfully loud. A lot of the\ntime, I still hate myself for being so irritable and needy, and can’t fathom how\nanybody could love me as I am.

I was at odds with myself, unable to understand why normal life felt so\nperplexing and imprisoning to me. I was detached from the world, with no trust\nin others or in my own potential to connect and be understood. Because I was so\nalone, my identity was also completely unmoored. I had no community to anchor\nmyself within. I had no idea I was transgender, no idea I was disabled, and\ncouldn’t articulate what I wanted out of life. Internally, I was fractured, a\nseries of faked personalities and protective shields that kept people at a\ndistance. I could only drop the shield when I was alone, but even in my solitude\nI was miserable and confused. I was all defense mechanisms, with nothing left\ninside worth defending.\n\nWhen a masked Autistic person lacks self-knowledge or any kind of broad social\nacceptance, they are often forced to conceive of themselves as\ncompartmentalized, inconsistent parts. Here is the person I have to be at work,\nand the person I must be at home. These are the things I fantasize about doing\nbut can’t tell anybody about. Here are the drugs that keep my energy levels up,\nand the lies I tell to be entertaining at parties. These are the\ntension-defusing distractions I’ll deploy when someone begins to suspect there’s\nsomething off about me. We don’t get the chance to come together into a unified\nwhole that we can name or understand, or that others can see and love. Some\nsides of us go unacknowledged entirely, because they don’t serve our broader\ngoal of remaining as inoffensive and safe as possible.\n\nIn the transgender community, we have a term for the fragile, confused state\nmany of us inhabit before we recognize our gender identity and decide to come\nout: it’s called being in “egg mode.” An egg is a trans person who is either too\nisolated from the trans community or too enveloped in denial to be able to\nacknowledge who they are. When you’re in egg mode, you feel ill at ease and out\nof place, without any clue why. You avoid considering certain painful desires\nthat lurk inside you, because confronting them would shatter the fake cisgender\nidentity you built in order to survive. When I was in egg mode, I wore a lot of\nflowing dresses and low-cut tops because I believed I was too “womanly” to ever\nlook good in the androgynous clothing I actually wanted to wear. I thought my\nbody had doomed me to forever be a curvaceous woman. Everywhere I went people\nrepeatedly told me I was incredibly womanly and talked a lot about how “fertile”\nI looked. Family, friends, and even complete strangers did their damnedest to\nconvince me I owed society my womanhood. My self-hatred and society’s rejection\ncompletely distorted the way I saw myself. Once I finally broke through that\nresistance and started dressing the way I liked and speaking in a lower tone of\nvoice, I realized I had been lied to. I actually looked and felt great as an\nandrogynous trans person. I hadn’t lost anything by giving up the façade. I was\njust free.\n\nIn my experience, being a masked Autistic is eerily similar to being in the\ncloset about being gay or trans. It’s a painful state of self-loathing and\ndenial that warps your inner experience. Though it often feels like being\n“crazy,” it’s not actually an internal neurosis. It’s caused by society’s\nrepeated, often violent insistence you are not who you say you are, and that any\nevidence to the contrary is shameful.\n\nBefore I knew I was Autistic, I imposed a lot of rules on myself, to help me\n“pass” as neurotypical. One of them was that I could never buy a piece of\nfurniture I couldn’t move by myself. Self-sufficiency meant I could pack up and\nleave at any time. To ask for help or to lead a richly interdependent life would\nbe akin to painting the words weak and pathetic on my body in bright crimson\nletters. I lived in such a way that no help was required.\n\nI slept on an air mattress. I made a “dresser” for myself out of milk crates I’d\nstolen from behind the grocery store by my house. I kept my small TV on the\nfloor. These measures also fulfilled another rule I’d set for myself: that I\nshould spend as little money as possible, and sacrifice comfort in the name of\nfrugality. The more money I socked away, the more self-sufficient I was, and the\nless disastrous it would be if I got fired due to awkwardness or burnout. This\nsame logic fed into my eating disorder and social isolation. Life as a person\nwho didn’t eat, drink, or ever leave the house very much was cheap and low-risk.\nI would survive by making myself smaller and smaller. I wondered why I was so\nunhappy and uncomfortable all the time, why I stomped around the house sobbing\nfor hours, but could not recognize that my compulsive self-denial was\ncontributing to my misery.\n\nMasking also alienated me from everyone I loved. I never allowed myself to\nbecome vulnerable with anybody, to share any of the anger, frustration,\ndysphoria, or obsessive yearning that roiled inside me. When safe people made\novertures to connect with me, I swatted them away and iced them out. Friends\nasked me how I was doing, and I responded with hostility. They tried to show me\nphysical affection and I froze up. When I was breaking down physical and\nmentally, I did all I could to continue seeming stony and strong. Even my most\naccepting loved ones had no choice but to love a half version of me. I had\nalmost no sense of who I was, either. When I had free time, I just sat alone in\nmy room and stared at the wall or mindlessly scrolled online.\n\nAll of this also slowly began to change the day I sat down in a hot tub with my\ncousin at an amusement park, and heard his theory that everyone in our family\nwas Autistic. I wasn’t ready for the information at first. But the moment I\nheard the word applied to my relatives, I couldn’t stop attaching it to myself.\nAll my life I’d been a jumble of disconnected parts, but now an image of myself,\nand a name for what I was experiencing, was finally coming together.\n\nThe opposite of alienation is integration, a psychological sense of connection\nand wholeness.[1] People whose identities are integrated can see a through-line\nconnecting the many selves they have been across various times and places. Every\nhuman being changes over time, of course, and alters their behavior depending on\nthe situation or setting they’re in. There is no static “true self” that stops\nadapting and changing. To a masked Autistic person, this fact can be really\ndisturbing, because we may lack a consistent “story” to tell ourselves about who\nwe really are. Our personalities are just means to an end, externally motivated\nrather than driven by some internal force or desire. Someone with an integrated\nidentity isn’t disturbed by change and variance, though, because they see a\nconnection that endures across the many people they have been: core values that\npersist across their life span, and a narrative of personal growth that explains\nhow they moved from the person they once were, to who they are today.[2]\n\nResearch (particularly decades of work by psychologists Dan McAdams and Jonathan\nAdler) has found that people who have integrated self-concepts are generally\nquite adaptable, resilient, and self-forgiving. They are able to develop new\nskills and pivot when life becomes challenging. They see themselves as the\nprotagonists of their life story. They’re also more likely to experience\npost-traumatic growth, understanding painful past experiences as something that\nhelped make them into a resilient person who can help others, rather than\nviewing it as a terrible “contamination” that ruined their lives or weakened\nthem.[3] In particular, McAdams and colleagues have observed that as people\ndevelop in maturity or recover from trauma, they tend to craft a redemptive\nnarrative about themselves. A redemptive view of the self tends to highlight a\nfew key qualities:\n\n\nKEY QUALITIES OF THE REDEMPTIVE SELF[4]\n\nGenerative\n\nWorks to improve the world, or benefit future generations\n\nSensitive\n\nCares about the needs of others, and is concerned by social injustice\n\nCommitted to Values\n\nDevelops their own set of core beliefs and values, which guide their behavior\nthroughout their lifetime\n\nBalances Independence with Connection\n\nHas a strong sense of one’s own agency and power, but also connects meaningfully\nwith other people and recognizes we are all interdependent\n\nIt’s striking to me how compatible the redemptive self is with the process of\nunmasking. The redemptive self essentially is an unmasked Autistic self:\nunashamed of one’s sensitivity, profoundly committed to one’s values,\npassionately driven by the causes ones cares about, strong enough to\nself-advocate, and vulnerable enough to seek connection and aid. A person with\nan integrated, redemptive sense of self knows who they are, and isn’t ashamed of\nit. They’re able to resolve life’s tensions in an authentic way that honors\ntheir feelings and personal ethics.\n\nIn McAdams and Adler’s work (and related work by others), there is no one path a\nperson must take to develop an integrated or redemptive sense of who they are.\nNarrative therapy has been found to be beneficial for those who want to\nreexamine the stories they tell themselves about their lives and their past, and\ncast them in a new light.[5] And some initial evidence suggests narrative\ntherapy can be beneficial for Autistic people struggling with social anxiety or\ncommunication challenges.[6] However, the redemptive self also can arise\norganically, as a person comes to understand themselves and to forge healthy,\nsupportive bonds. In my own life, I know that meeting other Autistic people and\nlearning to understand what Autism is naturally led to me writing a new “story”\nabout my past and who I was.\n\nThe final stage of Heather Morgan’s values-based integration exercise is to sum\nup your core values in about three to five words, and contemplate how each of\nthose values connects to one another to create a cohesive whole. To this end,\nHeather frequently encourages clients to draw how their values interlock with\none another, using whatever visual metaphor suits them best.[7] One client of\nHeather’s drew each of their five values (Openness, Acceptance, Achievement,\nLeveling Up, and Captivation) as separate strings on a guitar. Each could be\nactivated and “played” on its own, but it’s only when each of the values join\ntogether in a resonant harmony that they make the best music. Another person\nlisted their values (Compassion, Community, Creativity, Integrity, Intrinsic\nWorth, and Justice) as distinct colors in a rainbow. Another saw their values\neach as separate spokes on a bicycle wheel, all supporting one another and\nmaking forward movement possible. These metaphors reflect how Heather’s clients\nsee their principles connecting to one another, and aids them in contemplating\ntheir life as a whole greater than its underlying parts.\n\nHere is some space for you to explore how your own values relate to one another.\nTo complete this exercise, you’ll want to revisit the Values-Based Integration\nexercises from the Introduction, Chapter 5, and Chapter 7.\n\n\nVALUES-BASED INTEGRATION\n\n\nPUTTING YOUR VALUES TOGETHER\n\n1. Reexamine the Key Moments of your life that you described in the introduction\nto this book, and the 3 to 5 core values you identified as essential to those\nmoments back in Chapter 5.\n\nList those values here. Ideally, you want to aim to identify three to five\ndistinct values:\n\n2. In the space below, write down a definition for each of your values. This\nshould be a personal definition, not a dictionary definition. You want to\nidentify specifically what each value means to you.\n\nValue:\n\nWhat this value means to me:\n\nValue:\n\nWhat this value means to me:\n\nValue:\n\nWhat this value means to me:\n\nValue:\n\nWhat this value means to me:\n\nValue:\n\nWhat this value means to me:\n\n3. Finally, draw an image that represents your values and how they connect with\none another. This image might represent a hobby or an experience that is\nimportant to you, or it might evoke one of the key moments where you felt\nparticularly alive. The goal is to create an image that connects all of your\nvalues together, and helps you envision and remember all of them.\n\nTo download this chart, go to http://prhlink.com/9780593235249a010.\n\nA person’s values don’t all have to be equally weighted as they are in these\nexample metaphors. You could draw one particularly important value (say, Love)\nas a pillar on which the others rest, or draw one value as a wide umbrella that\ncovers and protects the rest. One client of Heather’s drew three of their values\nas spokes on an anchor, with their fourth value as the hook connecting the\nanchor to the “boat” of their life.\n\nI took several months to guide myself through Heather Morgan’s values-based\nintegration process, as I was working on an early draft of this book. I\nconsidered carefully what the key moments were in my past that had made me feel\ntruly alive. The interviews I conducted with other Autistic people and the\nresearch I did helped guide my self-reflection. Ultimately, I recalled a wide\narray of powerful moments in my past where I felt fully alive and realized as a\nperson, and those moments made it clear to me what my core values were. I\nthought it might be worthwhile to share them here as an example:\n\n\nVALUE #1: CANDOR\n\nWhat this value means to me: Honestly sharing how I feel and the way I see\nthings. Sharing observations that might not be convenient, but which are true\nand important to hear. Being honest with myself about who I am, who I enjoy\nspending time with, and what I want out of life. Speaking out when I see someone\nbeing mistreated.\n\n\nVALUE #2: COURAGE\n\nWhat this value means to me: Trusting my intuition and being willing to take\nrisks. Standing up for my beliefs even when they are unpopular.\nEnthusiastically, passionately saying “yes” to the things that I want, instead\nof searching for excuses to say “no.” Letting my emotions be loud and bold.\nTaking up space, and taking a huge, hungry bite out of life.\n\n\nVALUE #3: INSPIRATION\n\nWhat this value means to me: Observing the world around me, filling myself up\nwith ideas, and sharing my thoughts and passions with the world. Listening to my\nown creative drive and bursts of insight. Being a light that can guide others,\nby empowering people to do what is best for themselves.\n\n\nVALUE #4: PASSION\n\nWhat this value means to me: Giving myself the space to feel things deeply.\nMaking time to be sad, angry, resentful, or joyous. No longer filtering emotions\nbased on how others might receive them. Being unashamed of who I am, pursuing\nthe things I desire that feel good, and letting myself leave the situations that\ndistress me.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nStepping back and taking a look at my key memories and core values, I can see\nthat I’m a dynamic, powerful, clear-headed person who is always growing, and who\nhas risen up to defend the people and ideas that matter to me many times. I am\nso different from the inept, powerless, clueless, needy figure that I have\nalways worried abled people might see me as. I’m also nothing like the frigid,\npassive intellectual I’ve often masked myself as.\n\nThis exercise also made it painfully clear just how much my old, masked life\nblocked me and kept me dissatisfied. Alone in my apartment, socializing with no\none, I had no room to inspire others or to express myself. I was so afraid of\nupsetting other people that I didn’t risk standing up for what I believed in and\ndidn’t indulge in anything that gave me pleasure. It was my attempt at a\nneurotypical persona that failed me—the real me was a beautiful person who\ndeserved so much more.\n\nThe ideal result of this exercise is to help an Autistic person trust themselves\nmore. And looking back, I can’t think of a single time when I’ve regretted a\ndecision guided by candor, confidence, inspiration, or passion. Every time I’ve\ncut through polite bullshit, quit an unfulfilling job, said yes to a random\ninvitation, spoken out, or suddenly gotten an impulse tattoo, it’s felt\nincredible. Like coming up after a lifetime underwater, finally able to take\nfortifying gasps of fresh air. On the flip side, I can recall countless bad and\nregrettable decisions I’ve made that were motivated by fear, inhibition, or a\ndesire to be polite. Every single time I’ve apologized for an outburst,\ndownplayed a need, said yes to a job that wasn’t a good fit for me, or tolerated\na friendship that wasn’t respectful, it’s left me feeling soul-sick and anxious.\nIt’s never helped me sustain a meaningful connection. All it’s done is waste my\ntime and fill me with resentment. It’s always been better to be myself, no\nmatter the cost.\n\nWhen I think of how my four values integrate into a larger whole, I picture a\nshield. When I transitioned, I chose the name Devon in part because it means\ndefender. When I was in the closet (about both my transness and my Autism) I\nused to be shrinking and defensive. My whole existence was an apology for who I\nreally was. Now I draw strength from who I truly am, and I aim to be a shield\nfor others: a steadfast, brave presence that confronts the world head-on, and\ntries to shelter those who need it. My values protect me and the people I care\nabout. I used to believe that my mask protected me, but really it just weighed\nme down. Honoring my values does the exact opposite. It places my most Autistic\ntraits front and center and lets them lead me into battle, rather than hiding\nthem away. I am thankful now for the person I am, and I know others are thankful\nto know that person, too. And in the course of coming into an Autistic identity,\nI have met so many people who have gone along a similar path toward\nself-acceptance and openness, finally feeling free, integrated, and attuned to\ntheir values after years of a false, fear-driven performance. I want the same\nthings for you.\n\nI don’t want to pretend that life as an out Autistic person is effortless.\nAbleism is a powerful force of oppression. There are plenty of Autistics who are\nnever fully able to unmask. Some of us are in such perilous positions that\nopening up is too dangerous. Some Autistics conclude it is better to find small\npockets of acceptance where they can get it, and maintain their mask everywhere\nelse, rather than risk homelessness, police violence, relational abuse, or\nforced institutionalization by taking their mask off. For them, systemic social\nchange is needed, as is a significant improvement of life circumstances.\n\nA majority of Autistic people are underemployed and suffer from exploitation,\nisolation, and poverty. For masked Autistics who are women, transgender, Black,\nin poverty, or multiply marginalized, it’s especially dangerous to think about\ndropping the mask. Even for those of us who have the freedom to radically unmask\nourselves, there is still a lot of social judgment and the pain of past trauma\nto wrestle with. A single person asserting their self-worth isn’t enough to\novercome these forces. A world that embraces neurodiversity would, by\ndefinition, be a place where all people, cultures, and ways of being receive the\nsame level of dignity, autonomy, and respect. However, for Autistics seeking to\nachieve widespread acceptance and justice, unmasking represents both an\nessential step forward, and a way to stay sane while the world remains unjust.\nI’ve witnessed firsthand how much an Autistic person can socially and\npsychologically blossom once they escape an unsafe situation and find an\naccepting community. I’ve gone through that exact process myself. We will never\nbe able to build a more neurodiverse society if we do not name our common\nstruggles, form community ties with one another, and loudly declare that our way\nof functioning isn’t broken or bad. Much of the neurotypical world still wants\nto “cure” us of our difference, using genetic therapies and screening tools that\nwould prevent more of us from being born, and abusive therapeutic methods that\ntrain us, like dogs, to become more compliant. Even those of us who have not\nbeen forced through formal Autism treatment are still manipulated and pressured,\nday by day, into becoming smaller, softer, more agreeable versions of ourselves.\n\nTo unmask is to lay bare a proud face of noncompliance, to refuse to buckle\nunder the weight of neurotypical demands. It’s an act of bold activism as well\nas a declaration of self-worth. To unmask is to refuse to be silenced, to stop\nbeing compartmentalized and hidden away, and to stand powerfully in our\nwholeness alongside other disabled and marginalized folks. Together we can stand\nstrong and free, shielded by the powerful, radical acceptance that comes only\nwhen we know who we are, and with the recognition that we never had anything to\nhide."},{"title":"Test Section Title","content":"INTRODUCTION\n\n\nALIENATION\n\nWhen I moved from Cleveland to Chicago in the summer of 2009, I had no idea I’d\nneed to make friends. I was twenty-one years old, serious, and socially\nwithdrawn, and I truly believed I did not need other people. I’d moved to the\ncity for graduate school and figured I could pour all my energy into classes and\nresearch and think of nothing else.\n\nSolitude had worked pretty well for me up to that point. I had excelled\nacademically, and living a “life of the mind” kept me from worrying too much\nabout my many problems. I had an eating disorder that had ravaged my digestive\nsystem, and gender dysphoria that made me resent how other people saw me, though\nI didn’t yet understand why. I didn’t know how to approach people or initiate\nconversations, and I didn’t care to learn, because most interactions left me\nfeeling irritated and unheard. The few relationships I did have were enmeshed; I\ntook responsibility for others’ problems, tried to manage their emotions for\nthem, and lacked any capacity to say “no” to unreasonable requests. I didn’t\nknow what I wanted out of life, other than to become a professor. I didn’t want\na family, I didn’t have hobbies, and I believed I was incapable of really being\nloved. But I was getting good grades and my intellect earned me a lot of praise,\nso I just focused on those strengths. I pretended all the rest was a meaningless\ndistraction.\n\nWhen graduate school began, I rarely went out with my new classmates. The few\ntimes I did, I had to get completely hammered to overcome my inhibitions and\nseem “fun.” Otherwise I spent whole weekends alone in my apartment, reading\njournal articles and falling down strange internet rabbit-holes. I didn’t let\nmyself have hobbies. I barely exercised or cooked. I’d occasionally hook up with\npeople if I wanted sex or even just a little attention, but every interaction\nwas impassive and rote. I had no sense of myself as a multifaceted human being.\n\nBy winter of that year I’d turned into a lonely, isolated wreck. I’d spend an\nhour sitting in the shower while the hot water rained down on me, lacking the\nwill to stand up. I had trouble speaking to other people. I couldn’t think of\nany research ideas and lost all interest in what I was studying. One of my\nsupervisors chewed me out for rolling my eyes at her during meetings. At night\nbone-shaking sobs of despair and overwhelm would overtake me, and I’d pace\naround my room, whimpering and striking myself in the temples with the heels of\nmy hands. My solitude had somehow become imprisoning, but I was too lacking in\nsocial skills or emotional self-awareness to get myself out of it.\n\nI couldn’t understand how I’d gotten myself into that miserable position. How\nwas I supposed to know I needed friends, and a life? How could I go about\nconnecting with others, when every effort was so unsatisfying? What did I\nactually enjoy or care about? Around people, I felt I had to censor every\nnatural reaction, and pretend to have interests and feelings that were normal.\nPlus, people were so overwhelming. They were all so loud and erratic, their eyes\nlike painful laser beams boring into me. All I wanted to do was sit in the dark\nand not be bothered or judged.\n\nI believed something was fundamentally wrong with me. I seemed to be broken in\nways I couldn’t explain, but which everyone else could see at a glance. I spent\nseveral more years languishing like this, working myself to the point of\nburnout, having emotional breakdowns, relying on romantic partners for social\ncontact and a sense of worthiness, and googling things like “how to make\nfriends” in the middle of the night. Through it all, I never considered asking\nfor help or sharing with anyone how I felt. I lived by a very narrow set of\nrules, and remaining independent and invulnerable was chief among them.\n\nThings finally began to change for me in 2014, when I was on vacation at Cedar\nPoint amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio. My family went there every single year.\nWe were a family that loved our routines. I was sitting in a hot tub with my\ncousin, who had recently gone away to college and found the transition very\nchallenging. He confessed to me that he’d recently been assessed for Autism. I\nhad just completed my PhD in social psychology, so he wanted to know if I had\nany knowledge about Autism Spectrum Disorder.\n\n“Sorry, I really don’t know about that,” I told him. “I don’t study people with\nmental illnesses; my research is on the social behavior of ‘normal’ people.”\n\nMy cousin started talking to me about all the things he struggled with—how hard\nit was to relate to classmates, how adrift and overstimulated he felt. A\ntherapist had floated Autism as a likely explanation. Then my cousin pointed out\nall the Autistic traits he’d noticed were common in our family. We didn’t like\nchange. None of us could handle talking about our emotions and mostly interacted\nusing a surface-level script. Some of us had hang-ups about food textures and\nstrong flavors. We rambled on and on about the subjects that interested us, even\nif it bored others to tears. We were easily overwhelmed by change and rarely\nwent out into the world to have new experiences or make friends.\n\nWhen my cousin told me all this, I felt dread. I didn’t want any of it to be\ntrue because in my mind, Autism was a shameful, life-ruining condition. It made\nme think of people like Chris, an uncoordinated, “cringey” Autistic kid I’d gone\nto school with whom nobody had treated well. Autism made me think of withdrawn,\nprickly TV characters like Benedict Cumberbatch’s Sherlock, and the Big Bang\nTheory’s Sheldon. It called to mind nonverbal children who had to wear big\nclunky headphones to the grocery store and were viewed as objects rather than\npeople. Though I was a psychologist, all I knew about Autism was the broadest\nand most dehumanizing of stereotypes. Being Autistic would mean I was broken.\n\nOf course, I’d already felt broken for years.\n\nAs soon as I returned home from that vacation, I threw my bags down, sat on the\nfloor, propped my laptop up on my knees, and started obsessively reading about\nAutism. I inhaled journal articles, blog posts, YouTube videos, and diagnostic\nassessment materials. I kept this obsessive reading mostly hidden from my\nthen-partner, the way I kept all my deepest fixations hidden from people in my\nlife. I soon learned that itself was a trait common among Autistics; we tend to\nlatch on to subjects that fascinate us and focus on them with a fervor others\nfind weird. After being mocked about our passions, we become secretive about our\nspecial interests. Already I was thinking about Autism in terms like we and us;\nI saw myself clearly reflected in the community, a fact that scared and\nexhilarated me.\n\nThe more I read about Autism, the more things began clicking into place. I had\nalways been overwhelmed by loud sounds and bright lights. I got inexplicably\nangry in crowds; laughter and chatter could make me blow up with rage. When I\ngot too stressed out or became overcome with sadness, I found it hard to speak.\nI’d hidden all this for years because I was certain it made me a joyless,\nunlovable asshole. Now I was beginning to wonder why I believed such awful\nthings about myself.\n\nAutism was my newest obsession, a thing I couldn’t stop reading and thinking\nabout. But I’d had many other special interests in the past. I remembered being\npassionate about bat watching and horror novels as a child. Kids and adults\nalike had chided me for being too “weird” and “hyper” about those interests. I\nwas “too much” in so many ways. To other people, my tears were immature tantrums\nand my opinions were condescending diatribes. As I grew up, I learned to be less\nintense, less embarrassing—less me. I studied other people’s mannerisms. I spent\na lot of time dissecting conversations in my head, and I read up on psychology\nso I could understand people better. That was why I’d gotten a PhD in social\npsychology. I had needed to carefully study the social norms and patterns of\nthinking that seemingly felt natural to everybody else.\n\nAfter researching Autism privately for about a year, I discovered the Autistic\nself-advocacy community. There was an entire movement led by Autistic people who\nargued we should view the disability as a perfectly normal form of human\ndifference. These thinkers and activists said our way of being wasn’t wrong at\nall; it was society’s failure to adapt to our needs that left us feeling broken.\nPeople like Rabbi Ruti Regan (author of the blog Real Social Skills) and\nAmythest Schaber (the creator of the Neurowonderful video series) taught me\nabout neurodiversity. I came to recognize that many disabilities are created or\nworsened by social exclusion. Armed with this knowledge and a growing sense of\nself-confidence, I started meeting Autistic people in real life, posting about\nAutism online, and attending local meetups for neurodiverse people.\n\nI found out there were thousands of Autistics just like me, who discovered their\ndisability in adulthood after years of confused self-loathing. As children,\nthese Autistic folks had been visibly awkward, but they were mocked for it\ninstead of given help. Like me, they had developed coping strategies to blend\nin. Things like staring at a person’s forehead to simulate eye contact, or\nmemorizing conversational scripts based on exchanges they saw on TV.\n\nMany of these stealthily Autistic people fell back on their intellect or other\ntalents to gain acceptance. Others became incredibly passive, because if they\ntoned down their personalities, they wouldn’t have to risk being too “intense.”\nBeneath the inoffensive, professional veneers they had developed, their lives\nwere falling apart. Many of them suffered from self-harm, eating disorders, and\nalcoholism. They were trapped in abusive or unfulfilling relationships, with no\nclue how to feel seen and appreciated. Nearly all of them were depressed,\nhaunted by a profound sense of emptiness. Their entire lives had been shaped by\nmistrust in themselves, hatred of their bodies, and fear of their desires.\n\nI noticed that there were clear patterns in which kinds of Autistic people\nsuccumbed to this kind of fate. Autistic women, transgender people, and people\nof color often had their traits ignored when they were young, or have symptoms\nof distress interpreted as “manipulative” or “aggressive.” So did Autistic\npeople who grew up in poverty, without access to mental health resources. Gay\nand gender nonconforming men often didn’t fit the masculine image of Autism well\nenough to be diagnosed. Older Autistics never had the opportunity to be\nassessed, because knowledge about the disability was so limited during their\nchildhoods. These systematic exclusions had forced an entire massive, diverse\npopulation of disabled people to live in obscurity. This gave rise to what I am\nnow calling masked Autism—a camouflaged version of the disorder that’s still\nwidely neglected by researchers, mental health providers, and Autism\norganizations that aren’t led by Autistic people, such as the much-reviled\nAutism Speaks.\n\nWhen I use the term masked Autism, I’m referring to any presentation of the\ndisability that deviates from the standard image we see in most diagnostic tools\nand nearly all media portrayals of Autism. Since Autism is a pretty complex and\nmultifaced disorder, that covers a lot of different traits, which can manifest\nin many different ways. I’m also talking about any Autistic person whose\nsuffering wasn’t taken seriously for reasons of class, race, gender, age, lack\nof access to health care, or the presence of other conditions.\n\nUsually it’s white boys with conventionally “masculine” interests and hobbies\nthat are flagged as potentially Autistic when they are young. Even within that\nrelatively privileged class, it’s almost exclusively wealthy and\nupper-middle-class Autistic kids who get identified.[1] That group has always\nbeen the prototype for Autism when it’s described by clinicians or depicted in\nmedia. All the diagnostic criteria for Autism are based on how it presents in\nthis group. Every Autistic person is hurt by this narrow conception of the\ndisorder, even the white, rich, cisgender boys who are most likely to be\nreflected by it. For far too long, we have been defined only by the “hassle”\nthat white Autistic boys caused their well-off parents. Our complex inner lives,\nour own needs and sense of alienation, the ways that neurotypical people\nconfused, confounded, and even abused us—all were ignored for decades because of\nthis lens. We were defined only by what we seemed to lack, and only insofar that\nour disabilities presented a challenge to our caregivers, teachers, doctors, and\nother people who held power over our lives.\n\nFor years now, psychologists and psychiatrists have discussed the existence of\n“female Autism,” a supposed subtype that can look a lot milder and socially\nappropriate than “male” Autism does.[2] People with so-called “female Autism”\nmay be able to make eye contact, carry on a conversation, or hide their tics and\nsensory sensitivities. They might spend the first few decades of their lives\nwith no idea they’re Autistic at all, believing instead that they’re just shy,\nor highly sensitive. In recent years, the public has slowly become familiar with\nthe idea that women with Autism exist, and a few excellent books like Jenara\nNerenberg’s Divergent Mind and Rudy Simone’s Aspergirls have worked to build\nawareness of this population. It’s also helped that high-profile Autistic women\nlike comedian Hannah Gadsby and writer Nicole Cliffe have come out publicly as\nAutistic.\n\nThere’s a significant problem with the concept of “female Autism,” though. It’s\na label that doesn’t properly account for why some Autistics mask their Autistic\nqualities, or have their needs ignored for years. First, not all women with\nAutism have the “female Autism” subtype. Plenty of Autistic women visibly\nself-stimulate, struggle to socialize, and experience meltdowns and shutdowns.\nAutistic scientist and activist Temple Grandin is a great example of this. She\nspeaks in something of a monotone, avoids eye contact, and even as a young child\ncraved sensory stimulation and pressure. Though she’s very visibly and typically\nAutistic by today’s standards, Grandin was not diagnosed until adulthood.[3]\n\nAutistic women aren’t overlooked because their “symptoms” are milder. Even women\nwith really classically Autistic behaviors may elude diagnoses for years, simply\nbecause they are women and their experiences are taken less seriously by\nprofessionals than a man’s would be.[4] Additionally, not everyone who has their\nAutism ignored and downplayed is a female. Many men and nonbinary people have\nour Autism erased, too. To call the stealthy, more socially camouflaged form of\nAutism a “female” version of the disorder is to indicate that masking is a\nphenomenon of gender, or even of assigned sex at birth, rather than a much\nbroader phenomenon of social exclusion. Women don’t have “milder” Autism because\nof their biology; people who are marginalized have their Autism ignored because\nof their peripheral status in society.\n\nWhen an Autistic person is not given resources or access to self-knowledge, and\nwhen they’re told their stigmatized traits are just signs that they’re a\ndisruptive, overly sensitive, or annoying kid, they have no choice but to\ndevelop a neurotypical façade. Maintaining that neurotypical mask feels deeply\ninauthentic and it’s extremely exhausting to maintain.[5] It’s also not\nnecessarily a conscious choice. Masking is a state of exclusion forced onto us\nfrom the outside. A closeted gay person doesn’t just decide one day to be\ncloseted—they’re essentially born into the closet, because heterosexuality is\nnormative, and being gay is treated as a rare afterthought or an aberration.\nSimilarly, Autistic people are born with the mask of neurotypicality pressed\nagainst our faces. All people are assumed to think, socialize, feel, express\nemotion, process sensory information, and communicate in more or less the same\nways. We’re all expected to play along with the rules of our home culture, and\nblend into it seamlessly. Those of us who need alternate tools for\nself-expression and self-understanding are denied them. Our first experience of\nourselves as a person in the world, therefore, is one of being othered and\nconfused. We only get the opportunity to take our masks off when we realize\nother ways of being exist.\n\nI have found that my entire life and nearly every challenge I’ve faced can be\nunderstood through a masked Autistic lens. My eating disorder was a way to\npunish my body for its unusual, Autistic mannerisms, and a means of making it\nconform to conventional beauty standards, protecting me from negative attention.\nMy social isolation was a way of rejecting other people before they could reject\nme. My workaholism was a sign of Autistic hyperfixation, as well as an\nacceptable excuse to withdraw from public places that caused me sensory\noverwhelm. I got into unhealthy, codependent relationships because I needed\napproval and didn’t know how to get it, so I just molded myself into whatever my\npartner at the time was looking for.\n\nAfter a few years of researching Autism and forming my understanding of masking\nas a social phenomenon, I began writing about it online. I found that thousands\nof people resonated and identified with what I had to say. It turned out being\nAutistic wasn’t that rare at all (roughly 2 percent of people are diagnosed with\nit today, and many more have subclinical traits or cannot access diagnosis).[6]\nMany individuals in my professional and social circles privately came out to me\nas neurodiverse as well. I met Autistic people with full-time jobs in visual\ndesign, acting, musical theater, and sex education—not fields people associate\nwith our logical, supposedly “robotic” minds. I got to know more Black, brown,\nand indigenous Autistics, who had long been dehumanized by the psychiatric\ncommunity. I met Autistics who’d at first been diagnosed with things like\nBorderline Personality Disorder, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, or Narcissistic\nPersonality Disorder. I also found scores of transgender and\ngender-nonconforming Autistic people like me, who had always felt “different”\nboth because of their gender and their neurotype.\n\nIn each of these people’s lives, being Autistic was a source of uniqueness and\nbeauty. But the ableism around them had been a fount of incredible alienation\nand pain. Most had floundered for decades before discovering who they truly\nwere. And nearly all of them were finding it very difficult to take their\nlong-worn masks off. Even this fact made me feel more comfortable in my own\nskin, and less broken and alone. So many of us had been taught we had to hide\nourselves. Yet the more we joined in community with one another, the less\npressure to mask we felt.\n\nBy spending time with other Autistic people, I began to see that life didn’t\nhave to be all hidden anguish. When I was around other Autistics, I was more\nable to be blunt and direct. I could ask for accommodations, such as dimming the\nlights or opening a window to dilute the stench of somebody’s perfume. The more\nother people around me relaxed, spoke passionately about their special\ninterests, and rocked in place excitedly, the less shame I felt about who I was,\nand how my brain and body worked.\n\nFor years now I’ve been using my skills as a social psychologist to make sense\nof the scientific literature on Autism, and connecting with Autistic activists,\nresearchers, coaches, and therapists in order to firm up my understanding of our\nshared neurotype. I’ve also worked on unmasking myself, getting in touch with\nthe vulnerable, erratic, odd version of me I’d been socially conditioned to\nhide. I’ve gotten to know a lot of leading voices in the Autistic self-advocacy\ncommunity and read up on the many resources that Autistic therapists, coaches,\nand activists have developed to help train themselves and others to lower their\ninhibitions and drop their masks.\n\nToday I don’t hide the fact that I am pained by loud noises and bright lights. I\nask people directly for an explanation when their words or body language don’t\nmake sense. Traditional benchmarks of “adulthood,” such as owning a car or\nhaving children, hold no appeal for me, and I’ve learned that is completely\nokay. I sleep with a stuffed animal every night, and a loud fan blowing to block\nout my neighborhood’s ambient noise. When I’m excited, I flap my hands and\nsquirm in place. On good days, I don’t think any of these things make me\nchildish, or cringey, or bad. I love myself as I am, and others can see and love\nthe real me. Being more honest about who I am has made me a more effective\nteacher and writer. When my students are struggling, I’m able to connect with\nthem about how difficult maintaining a normal life really can be. When I write\nin my own voice, from my own perspective, I connect with an audience far more\ndeeply than when I try to seem like a generic, respectable professional. Before\nI started unmasking, I felt cursed, and almost dead inside. Existence seemed\nlike one long slog of faked enthusiasm. Now, though life can still be difficult,\nI feel incredibly alive.\n\nI want every Autistic person to feel the massive relief and sense of community I\nfound by recognizing myself and beginning to unmask. I also believe that it is\nessential for the future of the Autistic self-advocacy community that we each\nwork on living more authentically as ourselves and demand the accommodations we\nneed. With this book, I hope to help other Autistic people understand\nthemselves, join forces with fellow neurodiverse people, and gradually find the\nconfidence to take their masks off.\n\nUnmasking has the potential to radically improve an Autistic person’s quality of\nlife. Research has repeatedly shown that keeping our true selves locked away is\nemotionally and physically devastating.[7] Conforming to neurotypical standards\ncan earn us tentative acceptance, but it comes at a heavy existential cost.\nMasking is an exhausting performance that contributes to physical exhaustion,\npsychological burnout, depression, anxiety,[8] and even suicide ideation.[9]\nMasking also obscures the fact that the world is massively inaccessible to us.\nIf allistics (non-Autistics) never hear our needs voiced, and never see our\nstruggle, they have no reason to adapt to include us. We must demand the\ntreatment we deserve, and cease living to placate those who have overlooked us.\n\nRefusing to perform neurotypicality is a revolutionary act of disability\njustice. It’s also a radical act of self-love. But in order for Autistic people\nto take our masks off and show our real, authentically disabled selves to the\nworld, we first have to feel safe enough to get reacquainted with who we really\nare. Developing self-trust and self-compassion is a whole journey unto itself.\n\nThis book is for any person who is neurodiverse (or suspects that they are\nneurodiverse) and wants to attain new levels of self-acceptance. Neurodiversity\nis a wide umbrella, including everyone from Autistics, to ADHDers, to people\nwith Schizophrenia, brain injuries, or Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Though\nthe book’s focus is masked Autistic people, I have found there is considerable\noverlap between Autistics and other neurodiverse groups. Many of us share mental\nhealth symptoms and traits and have overlapping or comorbid diagnoses. All of us\nhave internalized mental illness stigma and felt the shame of deviating from\nwhat’s considered “normal.” Almost every person with a mental illness or\ndisability has been crushed under the weight of neurotypical expectations, and\nhas repeatedly tried and failed to earn acceptance by playing the rules of a\ngame that was designed to harm us. And so, for nearly every neurodiverse person,\nthe journey toward self-acceptance involves learning to unmask.\n\nIn the following chapters, I’ll introduce you to a variety of Autistic people\nwho flout the popular stereotypes. I’ll also explain the history of how Autism\nhas been defined, and how that’s led us to the obscured and estranged place\nwe’re in today. Using the real-life stories of Autistic people, as well as a\nbevy of psychological research, I’ll illustrate the many ways that masked Autism\ncan present and explain why so many of us never realize we have a pervasive\ndisability until relatively late in life. I’ll discuss how painful a lifetime of\nmasking can be, and point to data showing it takes a real toll on our mental,\nphysical, and relational health.\n\nMost important, this book will outline strategies a masked Autistic person can\ntake to stop hiding their neurodiverse traits, and describe what a world more\naccepting of neurodiversity might look like. My hope is that one day, each of us\ncan accept ourselves as the wonderfully weird, mold-breaking individuals we\ntruly are, and live as ourselves, without fear of ostracism or violence. I’ve\nspoken to a variety of Autistic educators, therapists, coaches, and writers to\nhelp develop these resources, have tested them in my own life, and interviewed\nAutistic people who’ve used them to improve their own lives. These experiences\nprovide concrete examples of what an unmasked (or less-masked) existence really\nlooks like. When you stop judging yourself according to the neurotypical gaze,\neverything from your relationship norms and daily habits, to the way you dress\nyourself and design your home is free to change.\n\nA life less trapped under the mask is possible for each of us. But building such\na life can be extremely daunting. When we think about why we started masking in\nthe first place, it tends to bring up a lot of old pain. One of the coaches and\ndisability advocates whose work has helped to inform this book, Heather R.\nMorgan, stressed to me that before we examine our masks and learn to take them\noff, we must first recognize that the version of ourselves we’ve been hiding\nfrom the world is somebody we can trust.\n\n“I think it can be risky for people to try to think about where their mask comes\nfrom and think about taking the mask off before they first know that there’s\nsomebody safe underneath of it,” she says. “Even talking about unmasking if we\ndon’t have a safe place to land can be terrifying.”\n\nIn my own life and in the lives of the Autistic people I interviewed for this\nbook, I’ve seen proof positive that the process of unmasking is worth it. But if\nyou’re just starting out on this journey, and you’re feeling adrift and confused\nabout who you really are, you might not yet believe there’s a worthwhile version\nof you waiting on the other side. You might still be haunted by negative media\nimages of Autism or be worried that unmasking might make you less functional,\ntoo strange, or somehow impossible to love. You probably also recognize that\nthere are real, material risks to letting your disability be visible,\nparticularly if you occupy a marginalized position in society. You might\nassociate authenticity with being unsafe for incredibly rational reasons, and\nnot be sure how and when unmasking could be worth it for you. So, let’s first\ntake a moment to consider the positive sides of unmasking, and what a less\ninhibited life might look like for you.\n\nBelow is an exercise developed by Heather R. Morgan, which she administers to\nclients on their very first meeting together. It is designed to help masked\npeople develop more trust in themselves and consider the existence of something\nbeautiful on the other side of the mask.\n\n\nVALUES-BASED INTEGRATION PROCESS\n\nStep 1: Find Your Why\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: THINK OF FIVE MOMENTS IN YOUR LIFE WHEN YOU FELT LIKE YOU WERE\nFULLY ALIVE. TRY TO FIND MOMENTS FROM THROUGHOUT YOUR LIFE (CHILDHOOD,\nADOLESCENCE, ADULTHOOD; SCHOOL, WORK, VACATION, HOBBIES).\n\n\nSOME OF THE MOMENTS MIGHT LEAVE YOU WITH A SENSE OF AWE AND WONDER—“WOW, IF ALL\nOF LIFE WAS LIKE THAT, LIFE WOULD BE AMAZING!”\n\n\nSOME OF THE MOMENTS MIGHT LEAVE YOU FEELING DEEPLY RECHARGED AND READY TO FACE\nTHE NEXT CHALLENGE, OR SATISFIED AND FULFILLED.\n\n\nWRITE DOWN EACH OF THESE MOMENTS. TELL THE STORY OF EACH MOMENT IN AS MUCH\nDETAIL AS POSSIBLE. TRY TO THINK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT WHY THE MOMENT STUCK WITH\nYOU SO DRAMATICALLY.\n\nMoment #1:\n\nMoment #2:\n\nMoment #3:\n\nMoment #4:\n\nMoment #5:\n\nTo download this chart, go to http://prhlink.com/9780593235249a009.\n\nIt may take you some time to complete this exercise. You can spend days or even\nweeks reflecting on it, making sure you recall moments from a variety of\nsettings and time periods. We’ll return to these moments later in the book, but\nfor now, you can just bask in how good it feels to recall whatever examples do\ncome to mind.\n\nAs we discuss the systemic forces that lead so many of us to mask, and explore\nhow masking harms Autistic people’s lives, you may find it helpful to return to\nthese memories from time to time, and draw strength from them. Let your memories\nserve as a reminder that you are not broken, and that the blueprint for building\na worthwhile, authentic life already exists within you."},{"title":"Test Section Title","content":"CHAPTER 3\n\n\nTHE ANATOMY OF THE MASK\n\nUndiagnosed and clueless about the root of her challenges, Crystal had to suffer\nin silence throughout childhood. As her grandfather observed, she was a\nwell-behaved, sweet kid, and a total teacher’s pet. Yet behind her smiling,\nagreeable façade, she was coping with constant social confusion and loneliness.\nIn classes where instructions weren’t always clear, like science and math, she\nfloundered. At school, she socialized with other girls, but she rarely got\ninvited to sleepovers or outings to the mall or skating rink. She kept her head\ndown around other people, and at home complained of frequent stomachaches and\nthrew “tantrums” out of stress. By middle school, it was impossible for her to\nignore how difficult she found regular life.\n\n“Once you get to middle school, you have this really complicated class schedule\nyou have to follow. All these transitions, bells going off, everyone switching\nclassrooms every hour, after school-activities, busy busy busy. I don’t do well\nwith shifting gears; it takes a ton of energy for me now and I was suddenly\nhaving to do it all day.”\n\nMany Autistic people find it challenging to transition between activities. Each\nchange requires a lot of what psychologists call executive functioning, a skill\nlinked to planning and initiating behavior.[1] Most Autistics find it relatively\neasy to give a task we enjoy our unbroken attention, but we find it challenging\nto gear shift. Crystal could sit reading a book for hours without interruption,\nbut in middle school classes switched so often that by the time she adjusted to\na new room and settled into paying attention, it was time to move again. Middle\nschool was also socially overstimulating: she went from sharing a classroom with\nfifteen children she’d known all her life to suddenly having to learn dozens of\nnew names, faces, and interlocking social dynamics.\n\nFriendship gets way more complicated and fraught as a preteen, and so do all the\nexpectations placed on you. The adults aren’t as kind and gentle as they once\nwere. If you take a long time to figure something out, they assume you’re\ndragging your feet out of adolescent apathy rather than executive functioning\ndifferences. If you have problems making friends, it’s because you’re a moody\nteen, not because neurotypical conversation rules are inscrutable to you. For\nCrystal, and for a lot of masked Autistic people, middle school is when a lot of\nstruggles really come to the fore. Then puberty hits, and you have to get used\nto a shifting and unfamiliar body, and a whole new slew of disturbances follow.\n\nAll Crystal knew at the time was that the school bells stressed her out and\neverything was moving too quickly. She felt like she was moving at half speed,\nwhile everyone around her was a blur. It was hard for her to keep track of which\ninterests she had faked around which people, and which personality she’d adopted\nto win over each teacher. She began to burn out, so her cognitive and social\nfunctioning declined even more.[2] Now she couldn’t even push herself through\nthe school day. All she wanted to do was find a private place to lie down and\nvegetate. No one had noticed yet that she needed help. So, she started begging\nher mom to let her skip school.\n\n“It was really hard to convince my mom to let me stay home that much,” Crystal\nsays. “And eventually I hit the limit of how many sick days I could have without\ngetting in trouble. But for as long as I could I got ‘stomachaches’ and stayed\nhome, which really kept me sane.”\n\nFor Crystal, faking sickness was an essential part of her mask. It could get her\nout of the overstimulating classroom and provide her some much-needed rest.\nMirroring her female classmates and pretending to like what they liked was an\nact of masking, too. And as school became more and more challenging, Crystal\nstarted masking in new ways, like pretending she didn’t care about “boy”\nsubjects like science and math.\n\n“There were girls around me who were getting interested in makeup and fashion,\ndating boys, celebrity gossip,” Crystal says. “I could play along with that\ntoo…. The cool vapid girl vibe was a shield for being confused by all the random\nsymbols in algebra that no teacher explained to me and just assumed I’d figure\nout. Instead of admitting I didn’t understand what the hell was going on I could\nflip my hair and say this is so boring, let’s talk about something that matters,\nlike Mariah Carey dating Eminem.”\n\nCrystal had already observed that if she asked for help with something that\nneurotypical people found “obvious,” she wouldn’t get assistance. They’d just\nfind her exhausting, or think she was asking questions just to waste time. But\nCrystal genuinely didn’t know what role x played in a linear equation. She\ndidn’t understand what “show your work” meant in a math context, so she’d write\nlong paragraphs explaining her thought process in words, and describing exactly\nwhich buttons on the calculator she’d pressed. Her teacher took this as some\nkind of personal insult, and wrote Crystal up for it. She cried in the detention\nhall the entire time, baffled that her best attempt at showing her work had\nsomehow been rude.\n\nThere were also elaborate rules about how middle-school-aged kids were supposed\nto act, but Crystal only ever found out about these rules when she’d broken one\nof them egregiously. Like the time she wore a painfully uncool tie-dyed T-shirt\nfrom JCPenney to school and the other girls wouldn’t quit laughing at it.\n\nCrystal says, “I had to become almost a cartoon of vapid femininity to explain\nwhy I was so out of it. I couldn’t be good at being a person, but I could be\ngood at being a girl. And my girly-ness could explain why I was so dumb at math\nand so bad at people. She’s just a ditz.”\n\nTimotheus Gordon Jr. tells me that when he was a child, he had to learn to mask\nhis youthful sensitivity and hide his nerdier interests, presenting as tougher\nand cooler than he actually felt inside.\n\n“In my community, crying is a sign of weakness, and I could be targeted for\nbeing weak, so early on I had to mask my sadness with aggression and learning\nhow to fight,” he says. “When it came to having interests like social sciences,\nhistory, and more geeky stuff like Pokémon, I had to hide it because that was\nconsidered to be uncool and a weakness.”\n\nAs was true in Crystal’s case, gender roles and ableism both conspired and\npushed Timotheus to hide the parts of himself that his neurotypical peers would\nlook down on and punish. He could play up his more gender-normative interests,\nsuch as his love of football (with all its statistics and player trivia to\nmemorize), but anything that marked him as too sensitive, odd, or not\nsufficiently masculine was risky.\n\nUnlike Crystal, however, Timotheus’s experiences as a masked Autistic are also\ninseparably tied to anti-Black racism. Though he now has many authentic\nrelationships rooted in like-mindedness and shared nerdy interests, he still has\nto worry about being perceived unfairly as he moves throughout the world. He\ndoesn’t just have to worry about being seen as weak as he did as a child—out\namong white people and in white institutions, he has to fear being seen as too\naggressive.\n\n“Even my mannerisms like speaking bluntly or directly, or matter-of-fact. I\nstill have to mask because I want to tell the truth. But it’s not about what I\nsay, it’s about what people interpret. And I have gotten into trouble because of\nwhat people interpret.”\n\nI think for most masked Autistic people, there are key moments in childhood or\nadolescence where we learn we are embarrassing or wrong. We say the wrong thing,\nmisread a situation, or fail to play along with a neurotypical joke, and our\ndifference is suddenly laid bare for all to see. Neurotypical people may not\nknow we’re disabled, but they identify in us some key flaw that is associated\nwith disability: we’re childish, or bitter, self-absorbed, or too “angry,” or\nmaybe we’re just awkward and make people cringe. Avoiding being seen in these\nways becomes our core motivation in life, each day a battle between the heavy\narmor we wear and the embarrassing characteristics that armor was designed to\ncover up.\n\nFor me, masking was always about not seeming childish. When I was a kid, I was\nforever getting corrected for acting like a baby, and that mortified me. When I\nwas disgusted by the textures of the unfamiliar food at sleepaway camp and went\ninto a full-blown, sobbing meltdown over it, I got reprimanded for being a picky\neater and a crybaby, and was forced to sit at the table all evening, until I\ngulped some cold ravioli down. When I failed to learn how to ride a bike at the\n“correct” age because I had poor balance and motor control, my dad shamed me for\nmy immature clumsiness (perhaps because it reminded him of his own masked motor\ndisability). As an adult, I would cuddle with stuffed animals at night with the\nblinds pulled down low and my bedroom door double locked, fearing that someone\nmight walk past the house or into my room and discover the terrible fact that\nholding soft, cute things brought me comfort.\n\nThe fear of seeming childish wounded me in a profound way, as it does many\nAutistic folks. One of the major ways abled society dehumanizes the disabled is\nby calling our maturity into question. “Adults” are supposed to be independent,\nthough of course no person actually is. We all rely on the hard work and\nsocial-emotional support of dozens of people every single day. You’re only seen\nas less adult, and supposedly less of a person,[3] if you need help in ways that\ndisrupt the illusions of self-sufficiency.\n\nNeeding help with toileting, for example, reminds abled people of the fact that\nthey once wore diapers, too, and that one day they might need diapers again.\nPeople who need help toileting are vulnerable, and reliant on others. That fact\ndistresses and repels the nondisabled, and they cope with their hard feelings by\nframing those who wear diapers as essentially different from themselves. They’re\nperpetual children, inhuman incompetents, not someone to empathize with. My own\n“childishness” reminded allistic people that much of what we call maturity is a\nsilly pantomime of independence and unfeeling, not a real quality of unbreakable\nstrength. Abled people hated seeing my awkward softness and confronting the fact\nthey might be sensitive and needy in their own ways, too. So they acted like I\nwas invisible, or that my childlike habits were perverse. I learned that\nfeigning maturity would be my sole salvation, the only way to ensure my humanity\ngot recognized.\n\nAs I grew older, I overcorrected for secretly being “childish” and\n“embarrassing” by adopting a façade of jadedness and hyperindependence. Though\nit manifested in a slightly different way than it did for Timotheus, I made it\nmy goal to always seem tough. I made fun of my friends, rolled my eyes a lot,\nand acted like I was too cool to care about anything. I tore down other people\nfor liking “babyish” things, like boy bands and cartoons. I refused to cry in\nfront of anybody, and resented anyone who did express emotions openly. I told\nmyself I’d never get caught being a baby ever again. That commitment meant never\nasking for help at all.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nIf you’re a masked Autistic, or suspect you might be, you probably can recall\nexperiences like Crystal’s, Timotheus’s, and mine. I think examining the origins\nof your mask can help you identify some of the deep-seated fears that drive your\nneed to wear it. Are you afraid of seeming stupid? Or childish? When you were\nyoung, did people accuse you of being cruel? Did you come to believe you were\nfinicky, or selfish?\n\nAutistic people frequently are stereotyped as immature, unintelligent, cold, or\nout of touch. And each of our masks helps to cover up the Autism stereotypes we\nfelt we needed to resist the most. Behind each mask, there sits a deep pain, and\na series of painful beliefs about who you are and what you must never allow\nyourself to do. Consequently, a big part of unmasking will mean facing those\nqualities you loathe the most in yourself, and working to see them as neutral,\nor even as strengths.\n\nHere’s an exercise to get you thinking about where your mask comes from. Many of\nthe negative qualities associated with Autism that we explore here will come up\nagain later, in exercises focused on reexamining your self-concept and\npracticing unmasking.\n\n\nREFLECTING ON THE NEED TO MASK:\n\n\nWHAT DOES YOUR MASK PROTECT YOU FROM?\n\n1.

The main goal of camouflage is to avoid detection as\ndisabled.\n\nCompensation: using specific strategies to “overcome” challenges and impairments\nrelated to disability. The main goal of compensation is to maintain the\nappearance of high, independent functioning.\n\nWhen Crystal attempted to disappear into the social background by making herself\nagreeable and passive, she was camouflaging how confused and overwhelmed she\nwas. When she studied up on celebrity gossip so she’d have things to discuss\nwith her friends, she was compensating for her comparative lack of neurotypical\nconversation skills. Some of Crystal’s masking behaviors were a blend of both\ncompensation and camouflage: faking being sick allowed Crystal to hide how\nexhausted and overloaded she was (in other words, it camouflaged these needs),\nbut it also provided her a neurotypical-approved excuse for getting the breaks\nshe required (which allowed her to compensate for her exhaustion). Camouflage is\nall about obscuring one’s unique qualities and struggles as a disabled person;\ncompensation is all about crafting little hacks and cheats to help you get your\nneeds met because you can’t request the accommodations you require. Playing up\nan interest in football because it was socially acceptable and gender\nconforming, for instance, was a compensatory strategy that served Timotheus\nwell.\n\nAll masked Autistics employ both compensatory and camouflaging strategies to\nhelp us get by, and apply them to a wide variety of tasks we find challenging.\nSomeone might verbally camouflage by forcing themselves not to speak too much\nabout their special interests,[5] for example, and socially compensate by\nresearching a friend’s Facebook posts before meeting up with them, so they’ll\nhave a good idea of what to chat about.[6] A person might camouflage their\nauditory sensitivities by gritting their teeth through the pain and never\ncomplaining about it, or they might compensate for it by wearing subtle\nnoise-canceling earbuds that don’t stand out as unusual.\n\nWhen I introduce neurotypical people to the concept of Autism masking, they\nusually understand it as a social process or performance. It’s true that masking\ninvolves things like memorizing social rules and feigning friendliness, but\nthat’s really just the most obvious form it takes. Most of us have to mask\neverything from our information processing style, to our lack of coordination,\nto our limited food preferences, to the fact that we require more rest than\nneurotypical people are expected to. Masking shapes the fields we work in, how\nwe dress and carry ourselves, where we live.\n\nMany maskers choose careers that allow them to hide their executive functioning\nissues. Or they realize they have no choice but to freelance because they can’t\nkeep up with all the meetings and socializing a full-time job requires. I was\ninitially drawn to academia because I believed it was a place where I could\ndress however I liked, keep my own hours, and be eccentric without consequence.\nI knew I’d never have the energy or patience to fake being professional by\ncorporate standards, so I compensated by developing skills and credentials that\nwould allow me to be valued for my mind rather than my looks or poise. Many\nAutistic people who work in tech gravitate to the field because Autism spectrum\ntraits are somewhat normalized there. Multiple neurodiverse people who do sex\nwork reported to me that the flexible hours and the potential of making rent\nwithin a few days of work made the career a good fit for them.\n\nMasked Autistics tend to arrange our lives around our limitations and needs, and\nsacrifice anything that might demand too much energy out of us. An impressive\nresume or academic transcript might hide the fact our homes are messy, our hair\nis unbrushed, and we haven’t socialized with anybody recreationally in months.\nIn a few key areas we may appear to be functioning highly, but that façade\nrequires we let everything else in life fall apart.\n\nMy friend Jess once described their compensation this way: “It’s like going to\nthe grocery store, but only being able to bring home what you can sneak into\nyour pockets when nobody is looking. And everybody else gets to just go through\nthe checkout and buy as much as they want, so they don’t understand why you find\nshopping stressful.”\n\nJess has ADHD, but their description of how challenging it is to lie, cheat, and\nsteal your way through a neurotypical-looking life when you lack the\naccommodations you need is just as relevant to life as a masked Autistic person.\nRegular life is more cognitively and emotionally demanding for neurodiverse\npeople than it is for neurotypicals, but we have to hide that fact from other\npeople on a daily basis. To prop up our façade of being “high functioning,” we\nbuild a messy, unstable scaffolding of flawed coping mechanisms. It’s no wonder\nwe report anxiety[7] and depression[8] at elevated rates. If the only food you\never get to eat is what you can steal, you’re gonna move through the world\nfeeling undernourished and hypervigilant.\n\nThough masking is incredibly taxing and causes us a lot of existential turmoil,\nit’s rewarded and facilitated by neurotypical people. Masking makes Autistic\npeople easier to “deal” with. It renders us compliant and quiet. It also traps\nus. Once you’ve proven yourself capable of suffering in silence, neurotypical\npeople tend to expect you’ll be able to do it forever, no matter the cost. Being\na well-behaved Autistic person puts us in a real double bind and forces many of\nus to keep masking for far longer (and far more pervasively) than we want to.\n\n\nTHE DOUBLE BIND OF BEING “WELL-BEHAVED”\n\nPsychiatrists and psychologists have always defined Autism by how the disability\nimpacts neurotypical people. A more “severely” Autistic person is not\nnecessarily a person who experiences more interior suffering, but rather someone\nwho suffers in a more disruptive, annoying, or disturbing way. The Autistic\nchildren who present the biggest hassle are the ones most likely to be referred\nto services, whereas those who can conceal their struggles are granted tentative\napproval—but risk never being understood or empathized with.\n\nResearchers Zablotsky, Bramlett, and Blumberg set out to understand how parents\nperceive the “severity” of their Autistic kids’ symptoms.[9] They surveyed\nnearly a thousand families raising Autistic kids, and also measured the Autism\nsymptom severity of the children themselves. What the researchers found was that\nparents did not accurately perceive the level of their kids’ suffering. Instead,\nparents based their ratings of Autism “severity” on how much their kids’\nbehavior bothered them and required a lot of their time and attention. Many\nchildren described by parents as “high functioning” were quietly coping with\ndebilitating sensory pain, or were falling behind academically or socially in\nsignificant ways. This carries over to how Autistic adults are perceived, and\nthe expectations that neurotypical institutions place on us to appear “normal.”\n\nThis desire to make Autistics compliant and nondisruptive is a large part of why\nthe prevailing treatment for Autism in children is Applied Behavior Analysis (or\nABA) therapy. ABA is focused on training Autistic kids to fake a neurotypical\npersonality. It’s a behavioral therapy, not a cognitive or emotional one. As\nlong as the Autistic child’s outward actions change and become less “disruptive”\nor more “normal,” it doesn’t really matter to the ABA therapist what’s going on\nbetween the kid’s ears.\n\nABA therapists train children to camouflage their Autistic traits using a system\nof rewards and punishments. ABA patients get sprayed in the face with water (or\non the tongue with vinegar) for failing to make eye contact, or for talking too\nmuch about their special interests. If a child engages in echolalia (phrase\nrepeating), chews on their fingers, or flaps their hands, they’ll be punished,\neven if they find these impulses painful to restrain. ABA patients are also\nforced to rehearse compensation strategies. They’re made to sit still for hours\nuntil they parrot back a conversational script correctly, and aren’t allowed to\nget up and play until they provide an “adequate” amount of eye contact.[10] They\nmay be asked to repeat conversational niceties like “please” and “thank you”\nover and over until they hit on the correct tone of voice, or be told to stand\nup and sit down repeatedly while the therapist snaps their fingers at them like\nthey’re a trained dog. When Autistic kids act out or demand attention, ABA\ntherapists are supposed to withdraw, leaving the room or ignoring their\ndistress. This teaches the Autistic child not to expect any help from the\noutside world.\n\nABA therapists also punish children by electrocuting them.[11] The electroshock\ndevices used in ABA therapy were briefly banned by the Food and Drug\nAdministration 2020,[12] before being reinstated in 2021.[13] Today, the\nAssociation for Behavior Analysis still vocally supports the use of such\n“aversives” to discourage visibly Autistic behavior. In 2012, an ABA-trained\nspecial education teacher came under fire for coating her young students’\ncrayons in hot sauce, to discourage chewing.[14] That case wasn’t a random act\nof violence. It reflects the core philosophy of ABA. The founder of ABA, Ole\nIvar Lovaas, used to coerce children into providing hugs and kisses to their\ntherapists by giving them candy.[15]\n\nForty-six percent of Autistic adults who underwent ABA therapy as kids report\nhaving Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) as a result of the experience.[16]\nMany experience deep shame even naming the subjects they feel passionate about,\nbecause they’ve been punished for having special interests. Some are unable to\nappreciate the emotional and psychological benefits of fidgeting or stimming\nbecause the importance of having “quiet hands” was so deeply drilled into them.\nMany don’t know how to refuse an unreasonable demand, or how to express emotions\nlike anger or fear. One former ABA therapist confessed on an anonymous blog that\nshe worries she conditioned her patients to be easy to manipulate and abuse.\n\n“Upset about being treated like a circus animal? Not my problem, kiddo,” she\nwrites. “I’m here to lure you with candy and manipulate you into doing my\nbidding, no questions asked. Which will make you excellent prey for sexual\npredators, abusive teachers, caregivers, and partners later in life.”[17]\n\nDespite how loathed ABA is by Autistic people, the parents and teachers of\nAutistic kids tend to love it, and research broadly deems it “effective.” This\nis because the efficacy of the program is based on the neurotypical gaze, not\nhow the Autistic child feels. ABA does teach Autistic kids to quiet down and be\nless annoying and “weird.” The problem is, it does so by training them to hate\nthemselves and obey all adults. It’s akin to evaluating how “effective” a\ndepression treatment is by asking the depressed person’s boss how they are\nperforming, rather than checking in with the depressed person themselves. Sadly,\nthe comfort and convenience of the neurotypical teachers and parents are\nprioritized, so ABA remains the one and only “evidence-based” treatment for\nAutism that most insurance plans will cover. Becoming “well behaved” is more\nimportant than being psychologically well.\n\nFor many Autistic kids, learning to obscure your pain often becomes a primary\nsurvival strategy; for masked Autistics, this isn’t taught within ABA therapy,\nbut as part of regular life. I didn’t go through ABA, but friends’ parents did\nyell at me for squirming awkwardly in my seat. No one forced me to rehearse\n“normal” conversational scripts, but kids laughed and walked away from me when I\nspoke in an inappropriately loud voice or quoted movies to express how I felt.\nMy Girl Scout leader shamed me in front of the whole troop for years because I\nalways sat with my knees pressed to my chest. My body craved the pressure of\nsitting in a curled up, “gargoyle” posture (many Autistic people enjoy sitting\nthis way), but the group leader found it so irritating she couldn’t help but\nberate me for it in front of the whole troop every single time it happened.\n\nAutistic educator and social equity consultant ChrisTiana ObeySumner has written\nabout an eerily similar experience of having her Autistic traits publicly shamed\nin Girl Scouts.[18]\n\n“One of my stimming activities is that I suck my thumb, and put my forearm to my\nface to both smell my natural scent and feel the soft hairs brush up against my\nnose,” she writes. “For some reason, this rubbed my scout leader the wrong way\nwhen I was around 7 or 8 years old. She called all of the other children to\ncircle around and hurl insults at me.”\n\nEvery masked Autistic person has a litany of experiences like this. Most maskers\ndodge the massive psychological bullet that is ABA therapy, but we still receive\nendless conditioning that says our unfiltered selves are too annoying, unusual,\nawkward, nonconforming, and cold to fit in. We also witness how other\nnonconforming bodies and minds are treated. When the entire world shames people\nfor being into “childish” things, having odd mannerisms, or simply being\nirritating, you don’t need ABA to program you into compliance. Everyone around\nyou is already doing it.\n\nI still remember the first time I consciously compared myself to a more\n“typically” Autistic person, and realized I needed to hide who I was. It was\nmiddle school, and I was sitting in the cello section a few feet away from\nChris, a percussion player.[19] Chris and I were both in the same special\neducation gym class; I was there because I was uncoordinated and had abnormally\nslow reaction times, and my muscles were incredibly weak, though no one figured\nout this was due to Autism. Chris, on the other hand, had been diagnosed when he\nwas very young.\n\nChris was smart and chatty. He loved sharing World War II trivia with people.\nHe’d ask questions in class that seemed to come out of nowhere, and sometimes\nwould involuntarily do a stiff-armed wave to stim, which (because of his World\nWar II obsession) people read as a Nazi salute. Kids laughed at him, teachers\ncondescended to him, and school administrators treated him like a problem to be\ncontained. He was the first Autistic person I ever knew, and how he was treated\nwas instructive to me.\n\nThat day in orchestra class, I was already on edge and annoyed by how loud\neveryone was. Percussionists were whipping drumsticks around; viola players were\ngossiping and laughing; violinists were tuning their instruments, filling the\nair with screeching, high-pitched peals. I coped by folding my arms tight across\nmy chest and screwing a pissed-off expression onto my face. The grimacing,\nsomewhat irritated expression that Autistic climate activist Greta Thunberg is\nnow famous for[20] is very similar to how I used to react to loud noise and\nsocial chaos. I had already started to cultivate a grumpy, goth persona to\nprotect me from seeming weak. Instead of showing that I was overwhelmed, my mask\ntold other people to stay far away.\n\nChris didn’t have that option. He couldn’t mask how upset he was by the\nnoisiness of the orchestra room. He was jittery and visibly agitated, slamming\nhis music stand up and down on the ground, trying to get his anxiety out. People\nlaughed at his unease and tried to provoke him by asking him questions they knew\nhe wouldn’t understand.\n\n“Hey Chris,” an older boy hollered. “Do you spit or swallow?”\n\nChris kept slamming the music stand up and down while he looked off into space\nand pondered. “I guess I do both,” he answered sincerely, not grasping the\nsexual implication. He interpreted it as a literal question about whether he\never spit or swallowed at all. People cackled and looked away. Chris’s whole\nbody was tense. He knew he’d stepped on some conversational land mine the older\nboys had planted.\n\nThen some prankster pulled the fire alarm, and the already loud room filled with\nclanging bells and kids yelling. There was laughter and mayhem as everyone\nheaded for the door. I felt sick to my stomach and furious, but able to hide\nbehind my mask of wincing pissed-off-ness. Chris, on the other hand, had booked\nit out of the room. School administrators found him circling the track outside,\ndashing and breathing heavily. Through the windows, we watched as the adults\ntried to reassure him there was no fire, that he was safe. But it wasn’t the\nfire that was bothering him. It was the noise, and the people. It took them an\nhour to coax Chris back inside.\n\nThough everyone at school knew Chris was disabled, they had no patience for his\nactions. Administrators groaned as they tried to get him to calm down; my\nclassmates and I joked while he kept awkwardly circling the track. We all saw\nhim as hopelessly immature and embarrassing. I recognized a much-loathed, deeply\nburied part of myself in Chris, and I hated him for it. I thought I was better\nthan Chris. I could “keep it together.” I took pride in the fact that no one\nwould ever catch me being nervous and weak. I remember being disgusted and\nfascinated by Chris in equal measure. I kept my attention pinned to him during\nevery orchestra class after that, picking apart every quality in him that I\nneeded to hide. I began to surround myself even more thoroughly in a camouflage\nof frostiness and rage.\n\n\nMASKING AS OVERCORRECTION\n\nFor many masked Autistics, the best way to camouflage a socially undesirable\nquality is to rebound into the complete opposite direction, and overcorrect for\nanything neurotypical people and institutions have taught us to hate about\nourselves. An Autistic person who was mocked for being needy and intense as a\nchild may camouflage as hyperindependent and emotionally avoidant, for example.\nOn the flip side, an Autistic person who has repeatedly been told they are\nselfish and robotic might instead wear a mask of helpful friendliness, and\nbecome a compulsive people-pleaser or teacher’s pet. We internalize many of the\nvalues of the ableist society we’re living in, and project those values both at\nother disabled people and at ourselves.[21]\n\nAfter the incident with Chris, I put excessive effort into hiding everything\nabout me that might reveal I was disabled. I avoided showing enthusiasm or\nstrong emotions for fear of seeming “cringey” and immature. I shut up about my\nobsessive interest in fruit bats and video games. I put on headphones and\nsunglasses when I went out in public, and didn’t look anybody in the face. I\nimpressed teachers with my wit and racked up debate trophies and merit-based\nscholarships, which fed into my sense that I was better than other people, and\nthat my intelligence was the real reason I was alone. I dished out so much\nforceful social aggression that no one could think about challenging me. In old\nhome movies from that time, I mock my friends and upbraid them for showing\nexcitement or innocence. It was a cruel act that only made me harder to love,\nbut I performed it perfectly. Until, like many masked Autistics, I finally\nrealized the mask was taking far more from me than it ever gave, and that if I\nwanted to stay alive, I’d need to let it drop.\n\nIn the table below, I’ve listed some of the most common negative stereotypes of\nAutistic people, and the opposing qualities often used to camouflage and\novercompensate against them. As you read through the list, you can reflect a bit\non the traits that were encouraged in you as a kid, and which qualities you did\nyour damnedest to avoid. I’ve also listed some common behaviors that go along\nwith each masking strategy, and left some blank space, so you can fill in your\nown examples. You may want to revisit your responses to the exercise at the top\nof this chapter, to help you reflect on which needs and fears shaped your own\nneed to mask.\n\n\nI WAS TAUGHT IT WAS BAD TO BE:\n\n\nSO I HAD TO PRETEND TO BE:\n\n\nI DID THIS BY BEHAVING THIS WAY:\n\n\n(ADD YOUR OWN USING THE BLANKS)\n\nArrogant\n\nHumble\n\n• Pretending I didn’t know the answers to questions\n\n• Keeping silent when people said things that weren’t true\n\n• Softening statements with phrases like “if that makes any sense” or “maybe” to\nmake myself sound less certain\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nCold & Unfeeling\n\nWarm & Friendly\n\n• Smiling all the time no matter how I felt\n\n• Asking people about their feelings and not talking about myself\n\n• Taking care of other people whenever they were upset\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nAnnoying & Loud\n\nAgreeable & Quiet\n\n• Only experiencing big emotions in private\n\n• Solving problems by myself\n\n• Not getting “too excited” about anything, including good things\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nChildish\n\nMature\n\n• Serving as a confidant for adults and authority figures\n\n• Carrying myself in a restrained, “proper” way\n\n• Acting like a “teacher’s pet” or “little professor” and distancing myself from\nmy peers\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nAwkward\n\nCool\n\n• Withdrawing from any activity I wasn’t instantly good at\n\n• Pretending to be aloof and uncaring\n\n• Rehearsing fake conversations in my mind so I could make talking to people\nseem effortless\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nClueless, Pathetic\n\nIndependent\n\n• Nodding or laughing, even when I have no idea what’s going on\n\n• Developing unique, private habits and “hacks” that make it possible for me to\nhold my life together\n\n• Making sure my life looks “put together” on paper, even at the expense of my\nhealth or happiness\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nSensitive\n\nStrong\n\n• Not voicing my needs\n\n• Feeling ashamed whenever I wanted to cry or express anger\n\n• Fighting internally with every “disruptive” emotion I felt\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nWeak\n\nTough\n\n• Mocking or being aggressive with other people\n\n• Thinking of myself as superior to others\n\n• Showing distaste for anything society considers feminine, soft, or tender\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nWeird\n\nNormal\n\n• Studying what other people like in a systematic, analytical way\n\n• Imitating people or characters’ mannerisms, style of dress, tone of voice,\netc.\n\n• Mocking those who are more obviously “weird” than I\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nTo download this chart, go to http://prhlink.com/9780593235249a007.\n\nThere are massive psychological consequences to adopting strategies like these,\nwhich go way beyond the anxiety, depression, and burnout we’ve already\ndiscussed. To maintain their masks and compensate for the challenges they’re\nfacing, many Autistic people fall back on an array of destructive and compulsive\ncoping mechanisms, including substance abuse, calorie restriction, excessive\nexercise, emotional codependency, and even joining cults. I think if we want to\nreally confront the role the mask has played in our lives and work on parting\nwith it, it’s important we face just how unsustainable and costly masking has\nbeen. We sacrifice a lot of our well-being and individuality in order to seem\n“normal.” In the next chapter, I’ll review the research showing how damaging\nthat is, and share the stories of a few Autistic adults who’ve begun to question\nwhether all the effort they’ve been putting into compensation and camouflage has\nreally been worth it."},{"title":"Test Section Title","content":"CHAPTER 8\n\n\nCREATING A NEURODIVERSE WORLD\n\nMost countries’ legal systems, health care systems, and educational institutions\napproach disability using what is called the medical model of disability. The\nmedical model understands disability as a condition that exists inside an\nindividual person’s body or mind. If you’re disabled, you personally have a\nproblem that must be identified, diagnosed, and then either treated or cured.\nThe purpose of medicine and psychiatry is to identify what is wrong with people\nand prescribe some kind of intervention that will make the symptoms of that\nwrongness go away. It is because of this belief system that we have\norganizations such as Autism Speaks, which presents Autism as a terrible\naffliction that steals children away from their parents and which desperately\nneeds a cure,[1] and therapeutic methods such as ABA therapy, which does not\nimprove Autistic kids’ happiness or comfort, but does render them obedient and\nless of a barrier to their parents living busy, productive lives.\n\nThe medical model of disability has given many of us (and most of our doctors\nand therapists) the idea that human suffering is best understood as a problem to\nbe fixed through individual changes. And for many illnesses and disabilities,\nmedical care and a medical lens is undeniably appropriate. If you’re someone who\nis in excruciating, daily pain due to nerve damage, medical treatment and\nmedication can help you. If you have a degenerative condition that progressively\ngets worse, such as multiple sclerosis, you have every reason to support medical\nresearch in pursuit of a cure.\n\nWhere the medical model of disability fails is in making sense of disabilities\nthat come from social exclusion or oppression. Sometimes what society (and the\npsychiatric establishment) considers to be an individual defect is in fact a\nperfectly benign difference that needs accommodation and acceptance instead.\nThough being gay was once classed as a mental illness, it never actually was\none. Trying to “cure” gayness never worked, and only caused more psychological\ndamage. In fact, categorizing gay people as sick created the illusion that they\nactually were mentally ill, because ostracism and shame does frequently\ncontribute to depression, anxiety, substance use, and self-harming behaviors,\namong other psychological issues.\n\nEnter the social model of disability, originally coined in the 1980s by disabled\nacademic Mike Oliver.[2] In his writing, Oliver described disability as a\npolitical status, one that is created by the systems that surround us, not our\nminds and bodies. A clear-cut example of this is how most educational\ninstitutions exclude Deaf students. There are entire school systems and\ncommunities run by Deaf people, for Deaf people, where everyone uses sign\nlanguage and access to audio captioning and other resources are provided as a\nmatter of course. In this context, being Deaf is not a disability. In fact, a\nhearing person who doesn’t know sign language is the one who would be\nmarginalized, if they were living in a Deaf-centered world.\n\nHowever, most people live in a world where Deafness and sign language use have\nmostly been seen as undesirable, and an indication a person is defective. The\nword dumb is an insult specifically because nonspeaking Deaf people were seen as\nless competent and less fully human than their speaking, hearing peers. Due to\nthis attitude, most public spaces don’t provide Deaf people with the resources\nthey need.[3] It is in this way that most schools (and other institutions)\nactively dis-able Deaf people. The same can be said for Blind people, who are\nfrequently excluded from public education and denied Braille materials and\nscreen-reading software. It’s also true of fat people, whose bodies are not\naccommodated on public transit, in classrooms, or in medical equipment, and who\nare frequently excluded from medical research.[4]\n\nThe social model of disability applies to many of the struggles Autistic people\nexperience. Each of us has been repeatedly overlooked and excluded because\nsociety views our differences as shameful defects rather than basic human\nrealities to accept. Often, we are dis-abled for completely arbitrary reasons,\njust as Deaf people are. A world where everyone uses sign language is possible,\nbut because hearing people have greater numbers and more social power than Deaf\npeople do, spoken language gets prioritized. Similarly, a world where eye\ncontact is not required is entirely possible (and in fact, there are many\ncultures where avoiding eye contact is considered polite).[5] However, in\ncultures where eye contact is expected, the Autistic people who find it painful\nare dis-abled both socially and professionally. And it isn’t just Autistics who\nare penalized by this norm: people who find eye contact difficult because of\nsocial anxiety, trauma, or because their home culture discourages it are also\nharmed by this social norm.\n\nHaving a social disability goes hand in hand with the obligation to mask. If\nstimming in public will get you assaulted or arrested, you are both socially\ndis-abled and forced to mask. If you struggle at work because you can’t play by\nelaborate, unstated social rules, and you wind up unemployed as a result, you\nhave been socially disabled and severely punished for your failure to mask\ncorrectly. This is why unmasking at a personal level has its limits. An\nindividual solution cannot fix a far-reaching system of oppression. As long as\nAutistic people exist in a culture and a political system that constantly\ncreates and re-creates our disabled status, we aren’t fully free to unmask\nourselves and live with authenticity and ease.\n\nAt present, the Autistic people (or anyone who is neurodiverse) who have the\ngreatest freedom to unmask are the ones who otherwise have the most powerful\nsocial position. I have a PhD and a cushy job as a professor; that means I get\nto set my own schedule many days, can dress in a comfortable, quirky way that\ndoesn’t give me gender dysphoria or sensory overwhelm, and block out alone time\non my calendar when I feel a meltdown coming on. My Autistic friends who work in\ngrocery stores, restaurants, bars, and day care centers have no such options.\nTheir daily schedules, attire, and even emotional displays are all tightly\ncontrolled when they are at work. All too often, they must plaster a smile on\ntheir face, swallow their pain, and incur significant psychological damage in\norder to stay employed. As a small, “nonthreatening” white person, I can flap my\nhands in public and scrunch my face into all kinds of grumpy expressions without\nmuch consequence. In contrast, if a Black Autistic person or a tall Autistic\ntrans woman fails to act perfectly poised in public, they may be harassed, have\nthe cops called on them, or worse.\n\nOn paper, many of these exploited and marginalized Autistics might look less\nmedically “well” than I do. They might suffer from depressive episodes, anxiety\nattacks, migraines, stomachaches, and more. In order to cope with the extreme\nstress of their lives, they’re more likely to smoke, drink, and use drugs than I\nam. They don’t get as much sleep as I do, and don’t feel as at ease in their\nbodies. But their disabilities aren’t more medically severe than my own. They’re\njust more socially disabled than I am, with less social power and freedom, and\nthat takes a real toll.\n\nThe only way that all Autistic people will be able to unmask is if society\nchanges dramatically. A world with more flexible norms and less stigma is a more\naccessible world, with fewer disabilities and far less human suffering. It’s\nalso a world that’s more welcoming to people with mental illnesses, immigrants\nand diasporic people, and anyone who has suffered because they’re not the\nperfect, cookie-cutter worker bee. As the psychiatric anthropologist Roy Richard\nGrinker writes in his titular book, Nobody’s Normal, our current definition of\nmental health is tied to the state and employers’ desire for productive,\ninoffensive conformity.[6] Emotions that are too large, passions that are too\nchildish and not profitable, habits that are too repetitive, and bodies and\nminds that require daily assistance all challenge this incredibly narrow\ndefinition of health. It is only by expanding our definition of what is\nacceptable human behavior and working to meet other people’s manifold needs that\nwe can move forward.\n\nMany people who are categorized today as disabled or mentally ill might have\nfunctioned just fine outside of an industrialized capitalist economy. Someone\nwho might thrive as a hunter, midwife, storyteller, or seamstress in a more\ninterdependent society may appear dysfunctional if trapped in an office. In\nfact, some genomic evidence suggests that when humans moved away from\nhunter-gatherer-based societies and toward agrarian (and later, industrial)\nones, alleles that predict neurodivergence became a disadvantage.[7] For\nexample, in societies where daily life offered less stimulation and novelty than\na life of hunting and gathering did, ADHD traits turned disadvantageous. Some\nresearchers have theorized that the same is true of Autism, but much of the\nresearch on the subject is quite poorly done, because it assumes Autism must\nhave always been a pathology and an impairment to reproductive success.[8] We\ndon’t really have good reason to believe that is true across all societies and\nall periods of time, though. Our ways of living and of caring for each other are\nso numerous, and haven’t always been as atomized as they are today.\n\nMany neurotypes simply are not suited to long workdays, lengthy commutes,\nnuclear families, and isolated “independence.” Arguably, none of us are well\nsuited for that—the nine-to-five workday is not evidence-based—but some of us\nsuffer more visibly and pervasively than others. By tearing down our current,\nconstricting definition of mental health, and celebrating different ways of\nthinking, feeling, and behaving, we can improve countless lives. By reworking\nsociety to make it more flexible and accommodating of difference, we can improve\nthe mental and physical health of all people. In this way, unmasking is a\npolitical goal. It requires we place value on all human life, no matter a\nperson’s abilities or needs, and view society as a social system that exists to\ncare for all people—not an apparatus to make everyone as productive as possible.\n\nSo how do we go about creating a world where neurodiversity is accommodated,\ndifference isn’t pathology, and everyone is free to be their true selves? It’s a\nlofty project, but here are some concrete policies that most Autistic\nself-advocacy organizations advocate for and are supported by the available\nsocial science, and which I believe would make a real difference:\n\n\nEXPANDED LEGAL PROTECTIONS FOR DISABLED PEOPLE\n\nIn the United States, the Americans with Disabilities Act (the ADA) dramatically\nimproved life for disabled people, and expanded their ability to participate in\npublic life. The law targeted two major policy areas: first, it required that\nbuildings and public transit become more physically accessible (for example, by\nrequiring accessible parking spots and wheelchair ramps); second, it banned\ndiscrimination against disabled people in housing, hiring, promotion, and\ncompensation.[9] Throughout the world, similar disabilities rights acts have\nbeen passed that aim to create greater access for disabled people by granting\nfair access to shelter, work, education, and public resources and spaces.[10]\n\nUnfortunately, for all its strengths, the ADA and many similar laws did not go\nanywhere near far enough. Though the law led to thousands of elevators and\nwheelchair ramps being built, and countless Braille signs being installed\noutside public restrooms, it also provided numerous exceptions to older and\nhistorical buildings. Many small businesses are still woefully inaccessible to\nwheelchairs and other assistive devices now, more than thirty years after the\nlaw passed. In some cases, recalcitrant cities and businesses exploited legal\nloopholes that allowed them to ignore ADA dictates, such as the grandfathering\nin of old structures and infrastructure.\n\nThroughout the 1980s, the Chicago Transit Authority refused to purchase buses\nwith wheelchair lifts, despite repeated promises to the disabled community that\nall new equipment would be accessible. It took a years-long series of\nwell-organized, disruptive protests[11] in which physically disabled activists\nblocked street traffic with their wheelchairs for hours at a time[12] before the\ncity finally budged and agreed to acquire accessible transportation options.[13]\nEven after the ADA was codified into law, this same resistance to include\ndisabled people persisted. To this day, about a third of CTA train stations lack\nelevators for wheelchair users, for example.[14] Whenever a station is remodeled\nto include an elevator and wheelchair ramps, local business owners and residents\nexpress outrage at the inconvenience and costliness of the improvements.\n\nEnforcement of ADA building requirements varies widely from state to state, and\neven those buildings that are perfectly compliant are really only accessible in\na handful of ways. The ADA does not require that public events be captioned or\nsign language interpreted, for example, or that remote options be provided for\nthose who can’t leave their homes. The law has nothing to say about bright\nlights, intense smells, loud music, or any of the other sensory torments that\nmake many public spaces inaccessible to Autistic people. Often, buildings that\nare technically ADA-compliant remain practically inaccessible. For example, my\nfriend Angel uses a wheelchair and requires help using the toilet. Many\nADA-compliant bathroom stalls are large enough to accommodate Angel’s\nwheelchair, but not large enough to accommodate both his wheelchair and his\ncaregiver. Most buildings are also too noisy and crowded for Angel to handle, so\nhis exclusion from public life is many layered.\n\nIf Autistic people are to be fully included in public life, we must vastly\nexpand accessibility requirements to cover the sensory needs of Autistic people\nand regulate the accessibility of events as well as buildings. It’s not just\narchitecture that can be hostile to disabled bodies and minds. As this book has\nrepeatedly shown, many of the ways that disabled people are excluded are far\nmore subtle, and social, than a clear-cut lack of ramps or Braille signage.\nToday, some grocery stores and retail shops offer weekly “sensory friendly”\nhours for Autistic shoppers and their families, where the lights are dimmed, the\ncrowds are reduced, and the music and PA systems are turned off.[15] This is\ncurrently done on a completely voluntary basis, by only a small number of shops\naround the world, but it provides a helpful blueprint for what sensory\naccessibility guidelines might look like. The Autistic Self Advocacy Network\nalso has a toolkit on best practices for creating sensory-friendly spaces, which\nhighlights the following:[16]\n\n\nBUILDING SENSORY-FRIENDLY PUBLIC SPACES\n\n\nADVICE FROM THE AUTISTIC SELF ADVOCACY NETWORK\n\n\nVISUAL\n\n * Make lights dimmable\n\n * Use diffused light sources rather than overhead or fluorescent lights\n\n * Restrict use of flash photography\n\n * Use clear, contrasting colors for presentation slides\n\n * Make signage and handouts easy to read and simple\n\n * Limit “visual noise”: remove distracting graphics, posters, etc.\n\n\nAUDITORY\n\n * Remind people to silence phone notifications\n\n * Replace applause with “sparkle fingers” or another quieter alternative\n\n * Ensure speakers use microphones consistently—yelling is much harder to\n   understand than speaking evenly into a mic is\n\n * Equip spaces with materials that absorb and dampen echo, when possible. Even\n   a large rug can make a big difference!\n\n\nTACTILE\n\n * Make elbow bumping or waving the default greeting, not handshakes or hugs\n\n * Adopt a relaxed dress code, so people can dress comfortably\n\n * Normalize the use of stress balls, fidget spinners, doodling, etc.\n\n * Fight the idea that makeup, uncomfortable formalwear, high heels, or bras\n   make a person more “professional”\n\n * Space out chairs, provide semiprivate seating near corners or barriers\n\n\nOLFACTORY AND GUSTATORY\n\n * Ban the use of strong perfumes or colognes at events\n\n * Use physical distance, barriers, or fans to keep kitchen and bathroom smells\n   out of other areas\n\n * Use sensory-friendly, green cleaning supplies\n\n * For catered events, tell attendees the exact menu beforehand\n\n * Provide “bland” foods as a backup\n\nIn addition to ensuring that public spaces are accessible on a sensory level,\nthe ADA (and similar laws throughout the world) should expand the accessibility\nof public events. Captioning, sign language interpretation, and virtual\nparticipation options should be provided for large-scale public events as a\nmatter of course, rather than by advance request only (as they currently are).\nIn many cases, expanding the accessibility of public events would require\nproviding sufficient funds and resources, including education on what\naccessibility means and why it matters. This approach would facilitate change\n(and reshape public attitudes toward disability) far better than a more\npunitive, fine-based approach, at least when it comes to public events.\n\nWhen it comes to enforcing building accessibility requirements and preventing\ndiscrimination in housing and employment, the ADA could be reworked to grant\ndisabled people more power to self-advocate. The state of California is one of\nthe most ADA-compliant states in the United States, in part because any disabled\nperson who encounters an inaccessible business in that state is free to sue the\nbusiness for a minimum of $4,000 in damages, plus legal fees.[17] This approach\ngives disabled people the legal power to challenge inaccessibility when they\nencounter it, and the financial means to do so, rather than simply hope that an\ninaccessible building is eventually inspected by the state. In most of the\ncountry, it’s incredibly difficult for a disabled person to prove they have been\ndiscriminated against or excluded. If the California model were expanded to the\nentire country, and modified to apply to employment and housing discrimination\ncases, disabled people would have far more recourse for discriminatory\ntreatment.\n\nEnding most states’ at-will employment status would also improve life\nconsiderably for disabled adults. At present, it’s easy for managers to fire an\nAutistic person (or a person with depression, schizophrenia, or Tourette’s) once\nthey discover we are disabled, so long as they lie and say they’re terminating\nus for some reason other than our disabilities. Since anyone can be fired at any\ntime for nearly any reason, there’s almost always an acceptable shield for\nableism.\n\nExpanding worker protections and making it harder to arbitrarily fire someone\nwith no notice would help prevent this from happening, and would improve the\nfinancial and job security of countless people. Autistic individuals benefit\nfrom having clear, measurable work outcomes, and a move away from at-will\nemployment would force companies to actually articulate their expectations in a\ndocumented way. Legal protections that expand access to short- and long-term\ndisability leave at work would also improve quality of life for many disabled\npeople, including Autistics who are at an elevated risk of extreme burnout. It\nwould mean we’d experience less pressure to mask any pain or despair we are\nexperiencing. Legally requiring employers to provide flextime and remote work\noptions without proof of disability would also immensely benefit Autistic\nemployees (both diagnosed and self-realized), and make work more accessible to\nparents, people with elder care responsibilities, and many others. In these and\nmany other ways, accommodating the needs of Autistics would create a more\nforgiving world for everyone, in addition to freeing us from the obligation to\nmask.\n\n\nBROADENED SOCIAL NORMS\n\nExpanding public accessibility and worker protections in the ways I outlined\nabove would have a massive impact on public attitudes toward disability and\nneurodivergence. The simple act of welcoming more Autistic people into the\nsocial world is not only a powerful symbolic gesture of support, it would also\nbe a massive step forward in normalizing neurodiverse mannerisms, behaviors, and\ncommunication styles. If Angel could use public restrooms easily and move\nthrough the public library or grocery store without experiencing a sensory\nmeltdown, far more members of his community would get to meet him, interact with\nhim, and witness him stimming and communicating using his iPad. At first, Angel\nwould be met with far more stares and questions than ever before. But over time,\nneurotypical people in his community would find his differences mundane, and\ncome to recognize that nonspeaking people who need caregiver support are\ncomplex, fully realized humans to be listened to and included.\n\nHistorically, people with mental illnesses and disabilities were\ninstitutionalized and locked away because they were viewed as unsightly and a\nthreat to public order. Throughout European history, asylums were places for\nanyone who flouted societal rules, including debtors who refused to work,\ncriminals who had violated the ethical and moral rules of the age, and people\nwho either looked unusual, or acted unusually, even in completely benign ways.\nSomething as simple as a harmless physical disfigurement could be grounds to\nexclude someone from a free, public existence.[18] We still live with the legacy\nof these views today. Even in the twentieth century, until\ndeinstitutionalization took hold in the 1980s, it was considered normal and\nappropriate to keep intellectually disabled and visibly Autistic relatives\nhidden from society, and even from their family members. Locking disabled and\nneurodivergent people in institutions creates a feedback loop of stigma and\nsocial repression: individuals who diverge from the norm even slightly are\nunthinkable, and unseeable, and so society shapes itself around an increasingly\nnarrow realm of existence, which in turn makes life harder for the next\ngeneration of people who deviate. It’s only by resisting this downward spiral of\nrejection and dehumanization, and opening society back up, that we can undo the\nmassive harm that’s been done and build institutions and communities that\nwelcome all people.\n\nSocial psychological research shows that contact with marginalized groups does\nhelp reduce public prejudice toward those groups. However, only specific forms\nof contact are beneficial. After all, white enslavers in the American South had\nregular, daily contact with the people they had stolen the freedom of, but that\ncontact did not make them any less inclined toward white supremacy. The power\nstructures surrounding the relationship and the financial incentives of\nexploiting enslaved Black people made it impossible for contact to change the\nsocial order. This same problem is evoked when Black activists state today that\nthey don’t just want a “seat at the table” in white institutions. The table was\nnot made for them, it was constructed to keep them out, and thus it needs to be\nupended entirely so that we can all gather around something new. Similar\nprinciples are often at work when we contemplate meaningfully including disabled\npeople.\n\nMerely observing a disabled person as an outsider or a pitiable curiosity won’t\ndo much to reduce neurotypical people’s biases. Instead, research suggests that\ncollaborative,[19] extended[20] contact shared between equals is what’s\nnecessary to really change attitudes.[21] It’s not enough for Autistic people to\nbe tolerated at stores and restaurants. We need to be given equal footing\n(relative to neurotypical people) in volunteer positions, in the workplace, and\nin our churches, community centers, and gyms. Those centers of public life must\nbe radically reorganized to suit the needs, work styles, and communication\nmethods of everyone. Only when neurotypicals are required to work and\ncollaborate with us as their peers will the social script be flipped, replacing\nthe pressure to mask with the obligation to accommodate. Notably, getting to\nthis place requires justice be attained for all marginalized people—it’s not\nenough for white Autistic people to be treated as equal to white neurotypical\ncoworkers; Black people, women, trans people, immigrants, and other oppressed\ngroups must be at equal footing as well.\n\n\nEXPANDED PUBLIC AND PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION ON NEURODIVERSITY\n\nThough collaborative contact is a powerful force of prejudice reduction, it also\nplaces a heavy burden on the Autistic people who lead the change. Being visible\nas a marginalized person is a double-edged sword, as any out transgender person\nwill tell you. Public awareness can put a target on your back just as easily as\nit can liberate. In a truly just world, I wouldn’t have to educate neurotypical\npeople about how I think and process information, and I wouldn’t have to slowly\nwarm people up to tolerating me, worrying the entire time that I might be mocked\nor attacked if I challenge neurotypical expectations too dramatically.\n\nSo, while making the world more accessible does benefit Autistic people, it’s\ninsufficient on its own. A robust program of educating the public on\nneurodiversity would have to accompany the policy changes I’ve recommended up to\nthis point. Public schools should include units on mental health stigma and\nneurodiversity in health and social science classes, starting from a very young\nage. As I’ve outlined in this book, ableism and masking hits Autistic people\nwhen we are incredibly young, and so interventions need to begin early as well.\nWhen we teach children about racism, sexism, and imperialism throughout history,\nwe should highlight how the oppressed were often branded as hysterical,\nparanoid, and insane. It’s important that all people—neurodiverse and\nneurotypical alike—come to realize how narrow definitions of sanity and\n“functioning” are used to harm and dehumanize. And since mental health concerns\nare so common (in any given year, roughly 20 percent of the population will\nexperience some mental illness),[22] it would benefit all people to have a\nstrong psychoeducation starting from childhood.\n\nTargeted trainings on neurodiversity should be provided to doctors, teachers,\nand mental health professionals as well. Educators should be aware that some of\ntheir well-behaved yet withdrawn students may be masked Autistics in need of\nassistance, and that their acting-out “problem” kids similarly might be\nneurodiverse. Therapists and counselors need far more robust training in serving\nthe needs of Autistic patients, and modifying or replacing treatments that\nrarely work for us (such as cognitive behavioral therapy) with those better\nsuited to our needs. Of course, this also requires that more research be\nconducted on how to treat things like eating disorders, depression, social\nanxiety, and substance use in our populations.\n\nAutistic and otherwise neurodiverse scientists should be prioritized when\nfunding such efforts. Much of the work published in the journal Autism in\nAdulthood illustrates how much the scientific literature can improve and deepen\nwhen those affected by an issue are the ones that study it. Even when I was in\ngraduate school in the early 2010s, professionals looked down on “me-search,” as\nthey called it, and implied that if you were studying something you had a\npersonal stake in, you couldn’t be trusted to be objective about it. Slowly\nthese attitudes are changing, but the stigma against being a researcher with\nmental health diagnoses or disabilities is still severe. Grant funding that\nactively encourages disabled and neurodiverse researchers would do a great deal\nto counter that bias.\n\nAs I’ve mentioned throughout this book, most professionals know very little\nabout Autism, particularly in adults and those who mask, and almost all approach\nthe disability from a medical disability lens. I’ve offered workshops on\nneurodiversity to medical professionals, and I have taught clinical\npsychologists, and I was initially gobsmacked to discover most had never even\nheard of the social model of disability. For a lot of care providers, the belief\nin disability as a medical defect to be cured is absolute and unflinching.\nBecause they have been trained to approach difference through a medical lens,\nand have never learned about alternatives, they routinely pathologize completely\nneutral, harmless Autistic traits and behaviors. Our caring professionals and\neducators must be made aware that alternate understandings of disability exist,\nand that their prejudicial attitudes often create disability where none might\notherwise be there.\n\nBelow are some common Autistic behaviors that teachers, therapists, and doctors\ntend to flag as signs of dysfunction, but which are completely harmless and\nought to be understood and normalized:\n\n\nCOMMON, HEALTHY AUTISTIC BEHAVIORS\n\nIntense studying of a new favorite topic\n\nNot noticing sounds or social signals when focusing on an engrossing task\n\nNeeding to know exactly what to expect before entering an unfamiliar situation\n\nSticking to a very rigid schedule, and rejecting deviations to that schedule\n\nTaking a long time to think before responding to a complex question\n\nSpending hours or days alone sleeping and recharging after a socially demanding\nevent or stressful project\n\nNeeding “all the information” before coming to a decision\n\nNot knowing how they feel, or needing a few days to figure out how they feel\nabout something\n\nNeeding a rule or instruction to “make sense” before they can follow it\n\nNot putting energy toward expectations that seem unfair or arbitrary, such as\nwearing makeup or elaborate grooming\n\nThe more educated professionals and the public become about Autism, the less\nAutistic people will have to mask. We won’t have to languish, unseen and\nunaccepted for years, feeling alienated but unable to name why. In the first\nchapter of this book, I likened being a masked Autistic to being a closeted gay\nperson. Gay people are forced into the closet at birth, because society assumes\neveryone is heterosexual, and is set up only to meet the needs of heterosexuals.\nAt some point remaining closeted becomes a process we put effort into, but it’s\na status that is forced on us, not a free choice. In much the same way, all\nAutistic people are expected at birth to behave like neurotypicals. If we aren’t\ndiagnosed and treated with respect as children, we have no choice but to\ncontinue on wearing a neurotypical mask for years. But as acceptance of\nneurodiverse people expands, the assumption that all people must think, act, and\nfeel the same way will gradually erode. If neurodiverse people and our allies\ncontinue our push for just treatment, we can eventually reach a place where\nsociety is not constantly disabling so many of us, all while withholding from us\nthe knowledge that we’re disabled.\n\n\nUNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE AND BASIC INCOME\n\nMany Autistics wind up having to mask because they never were identified as\ndisabled when they were young. Ignorance among teachers and care providers about\nthe varied ways that Autism can present is a huge part of this, but in countries\nlike the United States, a lack of health care coverage plays a huge role.\nAccording to 2020 survey data from the organization Mental Health America, over\n57 percent of Americans who experienced mental health struggles that year did\nnot receive treatment.[23] For those who desired treatment but could not access\nit, lack of insurance and lack of adequate insurance were among the most common\nbarriers.[24] Considering how costly an Autism assessment is, and how difficult\nit is for masked Autistics to locate competent care, it’s clear that mental\nhealth care access in the United States is in need of dramatic extension. At\nleast half of all Autistics in the country are currently undiagnosed, and the\ndiagnosis rate is likely far lower for women, trans people, people of color, and\nthose in poverty. If we are to normalize the Autistic experience and build\nrobust social systems that support Autistics and our needs, we’ll need to\nproperly care for the mental health of all people.\n\nAutistics, like most disabled people, are unemployed and underemployed at far\nhigher rates than the neurotypical population. Even those of us who can mask and\npresent as “professional” occupy a very perilous spot. One awkward moment or\nverbal misstep at work can get us fired, particularly if we are visibly disabled\nor already out about our neurodiverse status. Autistic job seekers struggle to\nfind work, because job interviews are ambiguous, high-stress performance\nsituations. Interview questions are rarely provided in advance, and job seekers\nare expected to provide socially acceptable responses and reactions without\nappearing to “try too hard” to do so.\n\nAt present, Autistic people must either mask ourselves in order to get and\nmaintain a job, or apply for disability benefits that are too meager to live on,\nand which come with a variety of caveats and strings attached.[25] If you are on\ndisability, you can’t get married to someone with an income (including their own\ndisability benefits) without having your payments reduced.[26] You also can’t\nput more than two thousand dollars in savings, or own any assets, lest you be\ndisqualified and cease getting payments as soon as the very next month.[27] And\nthat’s if you are able to qualify for benefits in the first place. Undiagnosed\nAutistics are not able to apply for disability, and recipients must have their\neligibility reevaluated on a regular basis (between every six to eighteen\nmonths).[28]\n\nProcessing and investigating disability benefit cases is incredibly costly. It\nis for this reason that writer and anthropologist David Graeber suggested in the\nbook Bullshit Jobs that it would be far less expensive and far more socially\njust to simply provide a baseline, universal basic income to all people, with no\nstrings attached. While replacing all social welfare programs with universal\nbasic income is probably not a wise move, based on the available data,[29] a\nless restrictive, more generous approach to providing disability benefits would\nclearly improve disabled people’s quality of life. Rather than forcing Autistic\npeople (and others) to prove and re-prove that we truly are disabled, and truly\ncannot work, universal basic income would be doled out to everyone, symbolically\nand practically asserting that all humans deserve to have enough money to live,\nno matter what.\n\n\nABOLITION OF CARCERAL SYSTEMS\n\nThere is no getting rid of ableism without eradicating the oppressive,\ndehumanizing social structures that created it. As anthropologist Roy Grinker\nwrites in Nobody’s Normal and psychiatrist Andrew Scull details in Madness in\nCivilization, throughout most of European history mentally ill people, disabled\npeople, and people who broke the law were all locked up in the exact same\nfacilities. There wasn’t a clear legal separation between being arrested for\nacting strangely, and being arrested for physically assaulting someone or\nstealing. Both “criminals” and “lunatics” were often regarded as disposable\nproblems, not human beings. Eventually, though, European legal systems saw fit\nto distinguish between those who behaved “badly” because they were sick, and\nthose who behaved badly because they were criminal or evil. At this point,\nasylums and prisons were separated, though both groups of incarcerated persons\nwere denied legal rights. In the twentieth century, the separation between the\n“evil” and the “ill” reversed somewhat, as forensic psychologists began to\nexplain law-breaking behavior as being caused by mental illnesses such as\nantisocial personality disorder, schizophrenia, and Autism.[30] Evil was no\nlonger understood as a moral state, but a psychological state of incurable\nbrokenness, essentially. Functionally though, that outlook on human nature isn’t\nreally any better. To this day, many Autistic children of color are put on the\nschool-to-prison pipeline as early as elementary school,[31] being severely\npunished for small misbehaviors, and even having the cops called on them when\nthey disobey their teachers or have meltdowns. This reaction is predicated in\npart on the belief that some people are just “bad,” and that it’s best to remove\nthem from society, not extend them compassion.\n\nThe criminal justice system and mental health system are deeply interwoven, and\nthey both serve to perpetuate ableism. As I described earlier in the book,\ndisabled people are at extremely high risk of being shot by police. Black and\nbrown Autistic people are, in particular, at an elevated risk of police violence\nand incarceration. Defunding the police and prisons and working to abolish these\noppressive institutions will help liberate Black Autistic people, as well as\nothers with disabilities and mental illnesses. Many people who oppose racist\npolice violence argue that cops be replaced with social workers or therapists,\nand that a state-run mental health force should be dispatched when emergency\ncalls are made. The law Timotheus Gordon Jr. and his fellow activists have\nhelped pass in Illinois, CESSA, would do exactly that. Such a policy change\nwould no doubt save numerous lives per year, particularly Black and brown\nneurodivergent lives. However, if we oppose the state-sanctioned racist violence\nof the police, it is equally important that we examine how mental health\nprofessionals forcibly institutionalize people of color and disabled people,\ntake away their children, declare them legally incompetent, and otherwise\nfurther the exact same societal evils that cops do. In the summer of 2021, the\nworld was shocked to learn that Britney Spears had been forcibly inserted with a\ncontraceptive IUD as part of her legal conservatorship,[32] and that her father\nhad control not only of her finances, but her performance schedule, access to\nher children, and ability to visit with her boyfriend. These are just some of\nthe rights that are routinely stripped from people with mental illnesses and\ndisabilities, and for those who lack the public visibility and privilege of\nsomeone like Spears, there is almost no recourse.\n\nThough culturally competent, compassionate mental health services can be\nlife-changing, psychiatry and psychology have also done immense structural harm\nto the very people they purport to serve. From the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, to\nHans Asperger’s research on “high functioning” Autistics, to the forced\nlobotomies performed on gay people and communists, immense violence has been\ndone in the name of science and “protecting” the public. When looked at through\na medical, individual lens, a push for greater mental health can quickly warp\ninto demanding compliance. So if we are to create a world where all Autistic\npeople of all backgrounds are able to unmask, we have to remove the systems of\npower that might violently punish those who fail or refuse to conform.\n\n\nUNMASKING IS FOR EVERYONE\n\nAbout eight years ago, my friend Wendy quit her job as an attorney very\nabruptly. I assumed that like many people in that field, she had gotten burnt\nout. In the years that followed, Wendy slowly pivoted to a new career as a legal\nwriter. It seemed to suit her much better: she got to work from home, spend more\ntime with her children, and go weeks without wearing anything but sweatpants.\n\nAfter I came out as Autistic, Wendy reached out to me privately about that time\nin her life.\n\n“My daughter is on the spectrum,” she told me. “She was having a really rough\ntime a few years ago, lots of meltdowns and no friends, and we couldn’t figure\nout why. That’s the real reason I left my old job.”\n\nI had suspected Wendy was Autistic herself. She was private and introverted,\nwith little patience for phoniness. She was unpretentious, with long,\nfree-flowing hair and no makeup. Sensitive and artistic, she had never seemed\nlike a good fit for the image-conscious, intense legal world. But as it turned\nout, Autism was not the explanation:\n\n“I really looked into it, but it turns out I’m not Autistic,” she said. “Was I\ndepressed and anxious at that time, because my job was horrible and my kid was\nsuffering? Yes, absolutely. But from raising my daughter I’ve learned I’m very\nnot Autistic. I just happen to love an Autistic lifestyle.”\n\nWendy’s life changed dramatically following her daughter’s diagnosis. She pulled\nback on her career so she could attend family therapy and homeschool her kid.\nThey joined groups for Autistic kids and their families, and her daughter\nstarted slowly making friends. Their family moved from the city to a small house\nin the countryside, and they all started spending a lot more time outside. As\nWendy’s family began to live at a slower, more Autism-friendly pace, Wendy felt\nher own depression abating. She was more relaxed and fulfilled. She found time\nto write poetry and make music, and to care for her older relatives when they\ngot sick.\n\nWendy says, “Getting to know who my daughter really is, and getting to shape our\nlives around that has been the best thing that’s happened to our family. So it\npisses me off so much when I hear other ‘Autism mommies’ on the internet talking\nabout how it’s this curse. It was a lifesaver for us!”\n\nWhen Wendy discovered that she had an Autistic child, her life was radically\ntransformed for the better. Circumstances forced her to get off the hamster\nwheel of conformity and productivity and constantly doing too much, and take a\nstep back to reevaluate what mattered most in her life. She had radically\nunmasked herself, even though she’s not Autistic: stripped free of the\nexpectations of a job that didn’t match her needs, she eked out a living in a\nmessy, cozy home filled with craft projects and clutter, and no longer felt the\npressure to present as a put-together, corporate success who could “have it\nall.”\n\nOf course, all these big changes were only possible because Wendy had the\nfinancial and community support to make them possible. Her spouse was excited\nabout the move to the country. The cost of living in the rural area they\nrelocated to was cheap enough for Wendy to transition to part-time work. Through\nher husband’s job, both Wendy and their daughter maintained their health\ninsurance. It was access to that health insurance that had made her daughter’s\ndiagnosis possible in the first place. The family had community support that\nmade child care and tutoring possible. When Wendy’s mother said ignorant things\nabout Autism, Wendy was able to sit down with her in therapy and work through\ntheir past issues, and recorrect her mother’s ignorance.\n\nMany Autistic people and our loved ones lack such advantages. Without access to\nshelter, health care, and a supportive network of loving people who are willing\nto grow with us, none of us are free to become our true, unmasked selves. This\nis why it is vital for the project of unmasking to be more than just a personal\none. All the self-affirmations and radical visibility practices in the world\ncannot overcome economic injustice, racism, transphobia, or profound social\nexclusion. We have to fight to create a more just, accepting, and supportive\nworld for all people if we wish for everyone to be free to unmask.\n\nI know so many Autistic people for whom their diagnosis or self-realization was\na clarifying and affirming moment. After the initial shock and shame passes,\ncoming into a neurodiverse identity can prompt you to reexamine your entire\nlife, and all your old values, allowing you to build something slower, more\npeaceful, and more beautiful. But it’s not only Autistics who benefit from\nembracing neurodiversity in that way. We all deserve to take a step back and ask\nwhether our lives line up with our values, whether the work we do and the face\nwe show to others reflects our genuine self, and if not, what we might want to\nchange.\n\nWhen we accept individuals as they are, instead of warring with their unique\nneeds and challenges, life can move at a more relaxed, accepting pace. A world\nthat allows all Autistics to safely unmask is a world where anyone with strange\ninterests, passionate emotions, environmental sensitivities, social quirks, or\nother differences is still seen as worthy and whole. Creating that world will\nrequire a lot of tireless political work as well as Autistic self-advocacy. But\nfor the neurodivergent and the neurotypical alike, it will be worth it."},{"title":"Test Section Title","content":"CHAPTER 5\n\n\nRETHINKING AUTISM\n\nLet’s start at the beginning: the first step of the unmasking process is\nrealizing you’re Autistic. It might not feel like it’s an active step toward\nself-acceptance or authenticity, but coming to understand yourself as disabled\nis a pretty dramatic reframing of your life. Almost every neurodiverse person\nI’ve spoken to for this book shared that discovering they were Autistic was a\npowerful aha moment, one that prompted them to rethink every narrative they’d\nbelieved about who they were. Painful labels they’d carried around inside\nthemselves for years suddenly didn’t seem as relevant: it wasn’t that they were\nstupid, or clueless, or lazy, they were just disabled. It wasn’t that their\nefforts had never been enough, or that they were fundamentally wrong or bad.\nThey simply hadn’t been treated with the compassion they deserved, or given the\ntools that would have allowed them to flourish. Naming their position in society\nas a disabled person helped them to externalize that which had long been\ninternalized. It proved that none of their suffering had been their fault.\n\nOf course, adopting an Autistic identity doesn’t instantly undo the habitual\ncamouflaging and compensation that so many of us have had to default to. Much\nlike the hypervigilance that’s common to trauma survivors with PTSD, masking is\na reflex that comes out most intensely when we experience uncertainty or social\nthreat. And recognizing oneself as a disabled person certainly doesn’t make the\nworld seem any less confusing or threatening. However, accepting ourselves as\nAutistic does free many of us (perhaps for the first time) to question whether\nit’s fair that we be expected to live in such a concealed, apologetic way.\n\nThe process of unmasking is all about rethinking the beliefs and behaviors that\nseemed normal prior to discovering we were Autistic. It means reexamining the\nstereotypes about Autistics (and other disabled people) we’ve been exposed to\nvia media, education, and formative experiences in our youth. It requires we\nquestion society’s most deeply cherished values, and notice where there are gaps\nbetween what we’ve been told we should be, and how we’d actually like to live.\nFinally, unmasking demands that we look back on our past selves with a spirit of\ngrace, gradually learning to see that the sides of ourselves that we were told\nwere too loud, too stilted, too weird, or too much are actually completely fine,\neven wonderful, and absolutely deserving of love.\n\n\nREFRAMING AUTISM STEREOTYPES\n\nA few years ago, Trevor was out camping with his friends in the Ozarks.\nEverybody was getting a little drunk, whipping one another with T-shirts and\ngoofing off. Somebody suggested the group hold an impromptu “forearm beauty”\npageant. Everyone laughed and stared at Trevor. A hush settled over the group.\n\nTrevor pretended to be bashful, then slowly strutted to the center of the crowd.\nHe rolled up his sleeves slowly, almost seductively, and then struck a dramatic\npose like something straight out of a comic book, putting his disproportionately\nlarge, muscular forearms on display for everyone to see. People oohed and aahed\nat the sight, and Trevor’s roommate fanned himself as if he was going to faint.\n\n“It’s an in joke in the friend group,” he explains. “I have really huge\nforearms. Like Popeye. From flapping my hands all the time.”\n\nTrevor has always regulated and expressed his emotions by flapping and\nfluttering his hands. Hand flapping is one of the most common Autistic stims.\nIt’s such a well-known, visible sign of Autism that training children to have\n“quiet hands” is one of the foremost goals of ABA therapy.[1] Though hand\nflapping is harmless and not disruptive, neurotypical people recognize it\ninstantly as a sign of disability—and therefore punish it harshly. People\nimitate Autistic hand flapping when they want to imply a disabled person is\nstupid, annoying, or out of control. Donald Trump famously did a cruel imitation\nof hand flapping during his 2016 campaign, while criticizing a physically\ndisabled reporter. But in recent years, despite all the social baggage, Trevor\nhas learned to embrace his flaps.\n\nTrevor came out as Autistic to his friends a few years ago. He’s forty-five now,\nbut has known about his disability since he was twelve. When he was diagnosed,\nTrevor’s mom told him it had to remain a secret for the rest of his life. She\nbelieved that people would underestimate him and exclude him if they knew he\n“lacked” many of the skills neurotypical folks had. For decades, Trevor\ndutifully hid his stims and tendency to overthink things. In college, he took\nimprov classes to help seem more outgoing. He read books on manners, and left\ndates early, so the guys he was seeing wouldn’t notice he had a hard time\nspeaking when he was tired.\n\nEventually, as the Autism acceptance movement became more visible, Trevor began\nquestioning his mother’s old advice. He poked around forums like reddit’s\nr/AutismTranslated and read the stories of people who’d come out as\nneurodiverse. On the website Stimtastic, he found chewable rubber jewelry (or\n“chewelry”) designed for stimming, and secretly ordered some for himself.\n\nTelling his friends about his Autism ended up being kind of anticlimactic.\n\n“They were not surprised,” he said laughing. “At all. They really know me.”\n\nBefore coming out, Trevor couldn’t explain to people why his forearms were so\nbeefy. It was just another odd thing about himself that he felt self-conscious\nabout. He wasn’t a muscular guy. Like many Autistics,[2] Trevor had a reduced\nmuscle tone relative to most of the neurotypicals he knew. He walked with a\nhunched posture and had reedy upper arms. Big button-up shirts helped hide his\nuniquely Autistic body.\n\nBut once Trevor was “out,” he could let people admire and joke about his buff\narms. He was shocked that people actually found them attractive. He’s not\nself-conscious about his body or his stimming anymore. All the mental energy he\nonce placed on obscuring his disability is freed up to focus on other things.\nAnd the fear of detection that his mother imbued in him has proven to be\nentirely misguided.\n\nIn previous chapters, we’ve reflected on the common reactions neurotypical\npeople have when they first encounter visibility-disabled traits in a child and\ncontemplated the many negative stereotypes about Autism that cause us shame and\ndrive us to mask. Here we’ll reexamine those early experiences and\nstereotypically Autistic traits and consider whether they can be viewed in a\nmore neutral or even positive light.\n\nIn the book Raising Your Spirited Child, author and parent educator Mary Sheedy\nKurcinka encourages frustrated and exhausted caregivers to rethink negative\nimpressions they have of their children.[3] Kurcinka wasn’t specifically\ndiscussing Autistics when she coined the term spirited child in the early 1990s,\nbut it’s pretty clear that her own spirited son has a lot in common with\nAutistic kids. Much like the term indigo child (which has been popular with New\nAge parents for decades),[4] spirited child refers to a somewhat vague\nconstellation of behaviors and traits that overlap a great deal with Autism and\nADHD. Parents of children with Autism-spectrum traits often try to find (or\ninvent) a softening euphemism for their child’s differences. It’s label\navoidance, with a bit of a spiritual sheen. In Kurcinka’s case, branding her son\nas spirited was an attempt to resist the stigmatizing attitudes that doctors and\npsychiatrists had about him and his future.\n\nProfessionals viewed Kurcinka’s spirited son as stubborn, difficult, and\nstrong-willed; he was prone to loud shrieking and intense reactions to stimuli,\nand defiant in the face of instructions he didn’t want to follow. Kurcinka did\nsome research of her own and found that all the writing available to parents\nabout kids like her son focused on how challenging they were to raise, and the\ntoll they had on their caregivers. The early 1990s were an era when people\ncommonly believed that a kid’s Autism ruined their family’s lives. An oft-quoted\n(and entirely incorrect)[5] statistic from that period claimed that parents of\nAutistic children had a divorce rate of 80 percent.[6] Neurodivergence was a\nhorror that visited families, and disabled children were resented for bringing\nit into the home. Dismayed by the poor quality of information available,\nKurcinka set out to create resources that were more compassionate and looked to\nthe behavior of spirited children with curiosity instead of condemnation.\n\nKurcinka asked that parents try to reframe their kids’ “problem” traits as\npositives. Many of a kid’s most disruptive behaviors were signs of their\nindependence and will. As disability advocate Rabbi Ruti Regan writes on the\nblog Real Social Skills, “noncompliance is a social skill.”[7] It’s only “bad”\nif you’re looking at it from the outside, from the perspective of someone who\nseeks to control or restrict. Though Autistic people are stereotyped as lacking\nempathy, it’s frequently non-Autistic teachers and caregivers of Autistic\nchildren who fail to reflect on their interior experience, and the motives and\nfeelings that make their behavior make sense. A noncompliant child may be\nstressful to raise, but if you want your kid to become a strong, healthy person\nwith the power to self-advocate, it’s crucial they know how to stand up for\nthemselves and say “no.”\n\nHere are some of the old, stigmatizing labels of “spirited” children that\nKurcinka set out to challenge, and the more positive alternatives she\nrecommended:\n\n\nOLD LABEL\n\n\nNEW LABEL\n\nStubborn\n\nAssertive, Persistent\n\nWild\n\nEnergetic\n\nDistractible\n\nPerceptive\n\nPicky\n\nSelective, Discriminating\n\nDemanding\n\nKnows clearly what he wants\n\nInflexible\n\nTraditional; does not like change\n\nManipulative\n\nKnows how to get needs met, charismatic\n\nAnxious\n\nCautious\n\nExplosive\n\nDramatic\n\nNosy\n\nCurious, Inquisitive\n\nLoud\n\nEnthusiastic, Zestful\n\nArgumentative\n\nOpinionated, Committed\n\nYou might have noticed that some of the traits listed in Kurcinka’s table were\nalso in the lists of negative Autism stereotypes earlier in this book. I\ndeveloped the tables in Chapter 3 long before reading Kurcinka’s book, based on\nfeedback from a large pool of Autistic adults. It turns out many Autistic\nadults’ least liked personal qualities are the exact same traits caregivers were\ncomplaining about in their children thirty years ago, at the time Kurcinka was\nwriting. These tables might have been developed independently of one another,\nbut they are clearly in conversation. When many of us were growing up, adults\nsaw us as loud, stubborn, uncaring, overly reactive, and burdensome. We’ve grown\nup believing we truly are hard to be around, and to love.\n\nWhen a person from a highly stigmatized group absorbs and believes some of the\nnegative stereotypes applied to their group, they’re suffering from what\nresearchers call self-stigma. Self-stigma is heavy; people high in it experience\nreduced self-esteem and see themselves as less capable than other people, and\nthey’re often afraid to seek help.[8] Psychologists have studied how to reduce\nself-stigma in people with mental disorders like depression, anxiety, and\nschizophrenia for decades; however, there is essentially no research into how to\nreduce self-stigma in Autistics. What little data does exist is on helping the\nabled family members of Autistic children to feel less shame about being related\nto someone disabled.[9]\n\nSince there’s a dearth of research examining self-stigma reduction in Autistics,\nwe have to look to the data on treating internalized stereotypes in other\npopulations. A review by Corrigan, Kosyluk, and Rush (2013) concluded that for a\nvariety of people with mental illnesses, coming out proudly about one’s\ndisability and presenting it as a valuable part of one’s identity helped reduce\nself-stigma’s impact.[10] A more recent experimental study by Martinez-Hidalgo\nand colleagues (2018) paired people with stigmatized mental illnesses with\nneurotypical conversation partners for a series of workshops, where they\ndiscussed mental health as well as other topics like creativity.[11] At the end\nof the intervention, participants with mental illness reported less shame about\ntheir conditions, and their neurotypical partners’ biases against people with\nmental illness went down a bit, too. This study did include some Autistic\nparticipants, though the sample was a very diverse array of people of other\nneurotypes as well, but the results are promising. In general, most research\ndoes show that proudly owning one’s disability can have a big impact on how\npeople feel—and it can change the attitudes of the neurotypical people around\nus.\n\nIt’s heartening to witness how fellow masked Autistics take proud ownership of\ntraits they once deeply disliked and were taught to loathe: childishness,\nselfishness, stubbornness, being a robot. Looked at from another angle,\nchildishness is joy and open curiosity. Selfishness is a vital protective skill.\nOne interviewee told me that his stubbornness and moral clarity is what allowed\nhim to be a whistle-blower when he discovered his company was violating customer\nprivacy protections. There is some research suggesting that people who are used\nto being disliked and going against the social grain are more likely to speak\nout and blow the whistle on injustice.[12]\n\nBobbi, the “gender failure” I spoke to in Chapter 1, tells me they have learned\nto see their unique combination of rashness and sensitivity as a real\nsuperpower. Bobbi is an occupational therapist who works with young children.\nThey say connecting with frustrated kids comes naturally to them because of\ntheir past, and their Autism.\n\n“When kids get told that they’re too sensitive, that their reactions to things\nare wrong, that really messes with them. But sensitive is not bad. If we were\ntalking about a metal detector, sensitive would be good. Or a bomb-sniffing dog.\nYou want a good instrument to be sensitive. Why is it bad to be very skilled at\nsniffing out the emotional bombs in the environment?”\n\nBobbi was emotionally astute, even as a child. Their family disliked how\nskillfully they picked up on emotional manipulation, neglect, and abuse.\n“Sensitivity,” despite being a sign of attentiveness and discernment, is frowned\nupon when you’re good at detecting things people would rather you not see.\nToday, Bobbi is in a place where their sensitivity is seen as the boon it really\nis. They help children by using that sensitivity to recognize and resonate with\ntheir pain.\n\nSome Autistic experiences are unpleasant no matter how you look at them.\nGastrointestinal issues are painful. Sensory overwhelm is an absolute torment.\nIt’s very understandable that many Autistic folks (myself include) resent having\nthese features of the disability. However, no personality traits or modes of\nthinking and feeling associated with Autism are innately bad. Usually we\ninternalize messages that we’re bad, immature, cruel people only because the\nneurotypical people around us lacked the tools to look at our Autistic traits\nfrom the proper angle.\n\nIn the table below are all the “negative” Autistic traits we explored back in\nChapter 2, reframed to center on the Autistic person’s perspective. You can try\nadding your own reframes, or your own examples of how your “worst” traits have\nserved your best interests.\n\n\nREFRAMING AUTISTIC STEREOTYPES\n\n\nI WAS TOLD I WAS:\n\n\nBUT ACTUALLY I AM:\n\n\nI VALUE THIS QUALITY IN MYSELF BECAUSE:\n\nArrogant\n\nConfident\n\nPrincipled\n\nIndependent\n\n• It helps me stand up for what’s right\n\n• I’m often the first person to speak out about a problem\n\n• I can set a positive example for others\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nCold & Unfeeling\n\nAnalytical\n\nRational\n\nThoughtful\n\n• I notice things others miss\n\n• I don’t get swept away in the heat of the moment like others do\n\n• I’m good at noticing connections and systems others can’t see\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nAnnoying & Loud\n\nEnthusiastic\n\nAlive\n\nOutspoken\n\n• I am my own best advocate\n\n• I raise other people’s energy levels\n\n• I experience intense happiness and recognize beauty\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nChildish\n\nCurious\n\nOpen-minded\n\nJoyful\n\n• I’m great at learning and growing\n\n• I experience the full range of human emotion\n\n• I take pleasure from the small things in life\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nAwkward\n\nAuthentic\n\nUnique\n\nDon’t Blend in with the Crowd\n\n• If something is hard for me, other people probably need help with it, too\n\n• My way of moving through the world is entirely its own\n\n• I don’t conform to unfair standards\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nClueless, Pathetic\n\nReflective\n\nUnassuming\n\nOpen About Vulnerability\n\n• I recognize we all need one another\n\n• I know how to ask for the help I need\n\n• I value my connections to other people\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nSensitive\n\nPerceptive\n\nEmotionally Attuned\n\nCompassionate\n\n• I recognize mistreatment very well\n\n• I’m good at taking the emotional temperature of the room\n\n• I’m in touch with my feelings and with the feelings of others\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nWeird\n\nOne of a Kind\n\nA Trailblazer\n\nUnconventional\n\n• I make the world a bigger, broader place\n\n• I challenge old conventions and unfair rules\n\n• I’m the ultimate authority on how my life should be\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nTo download this chart, go to http://prhlink.com/9780593235249a005.\n\nQuite frequently, the traits that inconvenience or weird out neurotypical people\nare the very same ones that define who we are and help keep us safe. When we\nstop taking an outsider’s perspective of our own disability and instead center\nour own perspectives and needs, this becomes clear. It’s not actually a bad\nthing that we are spirited, loud, intense, principled, or strange. These traits\nare merely inconvenient to systems designed by abled people that don’t take our\nunique way of being into account. But the more we work to normalize our\nneurotype, and the more we loudly, proudly take ownership of our Autistic\nidentities, the more institutions will be forced to change to accommodate us and\nothers who have been repeatedly shut out.\n\nAnother powerful step in the unmasking process is learning to reclaim our\npassions and special interests. Most of us have been stifling all our large\nfeelings for years—not just distress and discomfort, but joy as well. By happily\ndelving into our special interests and reveling in our Autistic capacity to\nhyperfocus, we can help retrain our brains to see our neurotype as a source of\nbeauty rather than a mark of shame.\n\n\nCELEBRATING SPECIAL INTERESTS\n\nClara is obsessed with new wave and pop musicians from the 1980s. Her bedroom is\npacked floor to ceiling with old records; her walls are covered with concert\nposters from long before her birth in 1993. Clara has candy-apple red hair, and\nshe wears thick leather platform boots, torn-up acid-wash jeans, thick pink\nlipstick, and flowy, androgynous black asymmetrical shirts. Clara’s favorite\nmusician is the late Pete Burns of the band Dead or Alive, most famous for the\nsong “You Spin Me Round (Like a Record).” She met Pete and got his autograph\nmultiple times, and has watched every concert recording, interview, and reality\nTV show he ever appeared in.\n\nClara has an Autistic special interest in Pete Burns, and engaging with that\ninterest brings her immense pleasure. When she really likes someone, she opens\nup to them by reciting facts about Pete Burns’s many cosmetic surgeries and\nmedia controversies. When she gestures with her arms, a tattoo of Pete Burns’s\nface peeks out from under her T-shirt sleeve.\n\nWhen Clara went away to college a few years ago, she decided to hide her\nobsession with Pete Burns from her new classmates. She wanted to start out on\nthe “right” foot, and not weird anybody out by being too fixated on the singer\nand reality TV star. So, she didn’t bring any of her records or posters with\nher. She covered her tattoo up with long-sleeved sweaters. All buttoned up and\nmasked, she found it very difficult to make friends.\n\n“Every day was sort of empty,” she says. “Just going through the routine with\nnothing to land on.”\n\nAfter a year of this, Clara was painfully depressed and listless. Her grades\nwere terrible and she had no appetite. With her parents’ encouragement, Clara\ntransferred to a school closer to her childhood home, so she could go back to\nliving in her bedroom, with access to all her Pete Burns stuff. She reconnected\nwith online friends who were just as passionate about music and alternative\nfashion as she was, and gradually her life began to improve.\n\n“It was like coming back to life,” she says, “like a little plant standing up\nonce it’s in the sun.”\n\nWhen it comes to special interests, Autistic brains are total sponges, absorbing\nfacts and figures at a rate that seems kind of inhuman to neurotypical people.\nWe can develop a special interest in nearly anything. Some of us learn to speak\nfluent Klingon; others memorize algorithms for solving Rubik’s cubes. My\nsister’s brain is a compendium of movie trivia and dialogue. My own special\ninterests have included everything from bat biology to the history of the Tudor\ndynasty, to personal finance, to subreddits run by so-called men’s rights\nactivists.\n\nThough the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders states that\nAutism is defined by having a “restricted” range of interests, some Autistic\nfolks cycle through new special interests every couple of months and become\npolymaths in a variety of subjects. Others are steadfastly dedicated to one\ntopic their entire lives. We don’t have control over what our special interests\nare, or when they appear or recede in our lives. Being obsessed with a person or\ntopic isn’t a choice, and does not necessarily reflect our values or beliefs,\nhence my former classmate Chris’s experience of being bullied for being obsessed\nwith World War II. I often find my special interests are a perverse fascination\nwith a person or movement I find morally abhorrent. Though others might find it\ndisturbing to read (for example) transphobic blogs for hours on end, I’ve found\nthat studying such subjects is empowering and informative.\n\nAutistic people find it rejuvenating and stimulating to spend time learning\nabout our special interests. In studies that examine the lives of Autistic\nadults, engaging with special interests is positively associated with subjective\nwell-being.[13] When we get to appreciate our hyperfixations, we feel happier\nand more satisfied with life. But for a long time, neurotypical researchers\nviewed special interests as an impediment to having a “regular” life. ABA\ntherapists penalize Autistic children for speaking about them,[14] withdrawing\nattention and affection when the subjects come up. This trains Autistic kids to\nhide their deepest joys, and avoid cultivating their passions.\n\nPunishing Autistic children for talking about their special interests is perhaps\nthe most arbitrarily cruel element of ABA therapy. Most children have fanatical\ninterests at one point or another, and in an adult, having an intense passion\ncan bring a great deal of meaning and pleasure to life, as well as an\nopportunity to connect with like-minded people. However, ABA therapy is rooted\nin reinforcing the narrowest of social standards and pushing them on Autistic\nchildren, in hopes that a high degree of conformity will keep them “safe.” Being\ntoo passionate about a video game, comic book, or wild animal species is often\nviewed in society as childish or limiting, and so Autistic children are expected\nto hide their enthusiasm.\n\nInterestingly, adults are only shamed for having an obsessive interest if that\ninterest is a bit too “strange,” and doesn’t come with the opportunity to rack\nup a lot of achievements or make a lot of money. People who routinely complete\neighty-hour workweeks aren’t penalized for being obsessive or hyperfixated;\nthey’re celebrated for their diligence. If an adult fills their evenings after\nwork learning to code or creating jewelry that they sell on Etsy, they’re seen\nas enterprising. But if someone instead devotes their free time to something\nthat gives them pleasure but doesn’t financially benefit anyone, it’s seen as\nfrivolous or embarrassing, even selfish. In this instance, it’s clear that the\npunishing rules imposed on Autistic children reflect a much broader societal\nissue: pleasure and nonproductive, playful time are not valued, and when someone\nis passionate about the “wrong” things, that passion is discouraged because it\npresents a distraction from work and other “respectable” responsibilities.\n\nThe mental health costs of preventing Autistic children from enjoying their\nspecial interests are immense. Having the freedom to develop and express special\ninterests is linked to improved social, emotional, and even fine motor\ndevelopment.[15] A survey of Autistic young adults by Teti and colleagues (2016)\nfound that many use their special interests to develop emotional awareness\nskills and coping strategies.[16] This frequently plays out in fandoms and nerdy\ncommunities, where neurodiverse people with mutual special interests find one\nanother, socialize, and sometimes begin to unmask. In a study of internet\nhabits, researchers Johnson and Caldwell-Harris (2012) found that Autistic\nadults actually had a greater variety of interests and more numerous interests\nthan their non-Autistic peers, and made far more social media posts about their\ninterest that were designed to provoke conversation, compared to neurotypical\npeople.[17] Autistic people are also a foundational part of most fandoms and\nconventions centered around shared hobbies—we devote a lot of energy to finding\nand creating spaces where we can interact with people who share our interests,\nand within nerdy fandom spaces, social norms tend to be more forgiving and\nrelaxed. It turns out that special interests aid us in becoming more outgoing,\nwell-rounded individuals.\n\nIn 2020, Autistic self-advocate Jersey Noah developed Special Interest Week, a\nweeklong series of reflection prompts posted to social media, which were\ndesigned to help Autistic people reflect and share about the things that bring\nus joy. So much of the writing Autistic people post online focuses on our\nfrustrations and experiences of being excluded and misunderstood. Online,\nAutistic adults are commonly expected to educate non-Autistic people about what\nour neurotype really is like, and to debunk all the misinformation allistics\nhave passively absorbed (and projected onto us) all our lives. Jersey created\nSpecial Interest Week in order to give Autistic people a bit of a breather from\nall this heavy educational and emotional lifting. In essence, they were creating\na kind of anti-ABA therapy, encouraging neurodiverse people to infodump about\nour obsessions as loudly as we wanted without worry about neurotypical people’s\nexpectations or needs.\n\nI consulted with Jersey when they were developing the prompts for Special\nInterest Week, as did several other Autistic creators, including Matt and Brandy\nHaberer, who host the disability podcast The Chronic Couple. In October 2020,\nthe first Special Interest Week ran on Instagram, with the accompanying hashtag\n#AutieJoy. Hundreds of Autistic people participated, posting photos of their hat\ncollections, video game achievement spreadsheets, and beaded earrings they had\nmade. It was cathartic to read these stories and share how my hyperfixations\nshaped my life for the better, too.\n\nBelow is an adapted version of Jersey Noah’s Special Interest Week prompts,\nwhich you can use either privately or on a blog or social media platform, to\nreflect on your own passions and what they’ve meant to you.\n\n\nSPECIAL INTEREST WEEK:[18]\n\n\nSEVEN PROMPTS TO HELP YOU REFLECT ON AUTISTIC JOY\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: EVERY DAY FOR A WEEK, SET ASIDE SOME TIME TO REFLECT ON ONE OF THE\nPROMPTS BELOW.

Masking is\na practice of silencing ourselves and letting neurotypical expectations dominate\nour actions, rather than being guided by our core personal values. But when we\ndrill down into what makes us feel happy, stimulated, and fully alive, we can\nidentify who we really are, and what our lives ought to look like. In the next\nsection, we’ll revisit our Key Moments from that earlier exercise, and see what\nthose moments have to say about who we are and what we value most.\n\n\nREDISCOVERING YOUR VALUES\n\n“Autistic people absorb a lot of messages that tell us, oh, that’s not allowed,\nI can never be good enough, the rules are different for me than for anyone\nelse,” Heather Morgan says. “And we can deconstruct those messages by asking,\nwell, what do my values have to say about that?”\n\nFor a long time, Heather believed the rules other people were expected to follow\nwere fundamentally different than the rules that applied to her. She was trying\nto fit within the lines neurotypical people had drawn for her, but her efforts\nall seemed to fail. The instructions she was given didn’t line up with people’s\nactual (unspoken) expectations. It was paralyzing. Eventually, she decided to\nstop focusing on what others desired from her, and let her life be guided by her\nactual values. That’s when she first developed her Values-Based Integration\nexercise, which she’s now led many Autistic clients through.\n\nIn the introduction of this book, I encouraged you to complete the first stage\nof the Values-Based Integration process, conjuring up the memory of five “key\nmoments” in your life where you truly felt alive. One of the goals of this\nexercise is to help you nurture a sense of trust in your instincts and desires.\nThe unique qualities and feelings associated with each of your key moments can\nalso help you figure out what it is that you value most in life. In order to\nname what your values are, you can look back on these memories and try to\narticulate exactly why each of them was so special.\n\n“Once you have finished telling each of your five stories,” Heather Morgan\nwrites,[19] “go back and look for the key words that describe each story. Most\nstories will have at least two or three key words, and some key words will be\nrepeated between stories.”\n\nSuppose, for example, that one of the key moments that came to mind for you was\nyour wedding day. What felt especially poignant about that day? Was it being\nsurrounded by all of your loved ones? Was it the connection you felt toward your\npartner? Did you enjoy the attention? The celebration? Try to identify what made\nthat time really stand out and do so without passing any judgment. Notice any\nwords that appear multiple times, across multiple memories. Try to dig a little\ndeeper and use values-based words (such as connection, family, creativity, or\ngenerosity) to describe those special experiences.\n\n\nVALUES-BASED INTEGRATION:[20]\n\n\nIDENTIFYING YOUR VALUES\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: TO COMPLETE THIS ACTIVITY, YOU WILL NEED TO REFER TO THE KEY\nMOMENTS EXERCISE YOU COMPLETED IN THE INTRODUCTION OF THIS BOOK (PAGE 14).\n\n\nREVIEW THOSE MEMORIES AND TRY TO LIST KEY WORDS THAT DESCRIBE EACH MOMENT AND\nWHY IT WAS SPECIAL TO YOU. MOST STORIES WILL HAVE AT LEAST TWO OR THREE KEY\nWORDS, AND SOME KEY WORDS WILL BE REPEATED BETWEEN STORIES. FEEL FREE TO LIST AS\nMANY WORDS AS YOU LIKE, UNTIL YOU IDENTIFY ONES THAT REALLY CAPTURE YOUR\nFEELINGS.\n\nMoment 1:\n\nKey words that describe why this moment was special:\n\nMoment 2:\n\nKey words that describe why this moment was special:\n\nMoment 3:\n\nKey words that describe why this moment was special:\n\nMoment 4:\n\nKey words that describe why this moment was special:\n\nMoment 5:\n\nKey words that describe why this moment was special:\n\nTry to identify which of the words you listed above are the most important or\nresonant. Look to see if any words can be grouped together, or if there is a\nsingle word that sums up an idea for you.\n\nYou can list key words and try grouping them together here:\n\nTo download this chart, go to http://prhlink.com/9780593235249a008.\n\nOur key memories and the words we use to describe them can help us understand\nwhat matters most to us and offer up a valuable contrast between the way we\ncurrently are living and the life we’d like to build.\n\nTo help illustrate this process and some of the conclusions that can come from\nit, let me offer one of my own key moments. In the summer of 2019, I was walking\nhome through Wrigleyville, the sports-bar-laden Chicago neighborhood surrounding\nthe Cub’s Wrigley Field. There was a pub crawl going on, so a lot of drunk\npeople were ambling from bar to bar. As I walked past a quiet side street, I saw\na woman walking away from a visibly drunk, staggering man. She kept nodding and\nsmiling but trying to walk away, and seemed deeply uncomfortable. The man kept\nstumbling toward her and yelling for her attention. I decided to stop what I was\ndoing and follow the pair down the street.\n\nI watched for a while as the woman tried to put some distance between herself\nand the man, who keep towering over her and asking her questions. Her mannerisms\nwere placating and disarming. He kept putting his arms around her shoulders and\nshe kept slipping out from under him. After a few moments, I saw the man\nescalate, and put his hand on the woman’s lower back. She tensed up. His hand\nwandered lower onto the seat of her jeans. My instincts kicked into gear.\n\n“Leave her alone, dude,” I yelled out, racing up to meet them. The man\nstiffened. “Let her go.”\n\nHe looked back at me, his eyes bleary, and slowly said, “We’re fine.”\n\n“You need to stop touching her,” I said in a low, authoritative voice. I put my\nbody between hers and his. “You just stay here with me until she has gone on her\nway.”\n\nHe grimaced at me and slurred the words, “You leave us alone.”\n\n“No, dude. You’re going to leave her alone. You’re going to stay here, with me,\nuntil she gets far away.”\n\nHe was visibly angry and for a moment I thought I was gonna get punched. Yet I\nhad no fear. I felt totally in control of the situation. I continued telling him\nto stay put, my voice now at full volume so others in the neighborhood could\nhear. The guy was definitely furious, but he stood there with me, staring me\ndown, swaying menacingly, until the woman got to her apartment about a half a\nblock away, closed the door, and locked herself inside.\n\n“Get out of here,” I told the guy when it was over. “You go walk the other way.”\nI stayed put until he was long gone.\n\nMost of my life, I have lacked courage and clarity of purpose. I hesitate,\nsecond-guess myself, worry that I’ll embarrass someone. I often tell myself I’m\nmisreading the situation I’m in, or that I don’t have the power to fix the\ninjustices I see around me. I also tend to put my own well-being before that of\nothers, because I don’t trust that anyone else will ever value me. In this\ninstance, I wasn’t burdened with any of that doubt, or that cowardice. I stood\nup for what was right, even though doing so was “awkward” and also might have\ngotten me hurt. I made a judgment call and used my wonderful Autistic arrogance\nto take charge.\n\nWhen I contrast that strong, confident version of me with the nervous, smiling,\nrestrained-to-a-fault person I often am when I’m masking, I can see exactly\nwhere my values lie, and how my mask blocks me from being my authentic self.\nWhen I let the fear of seeming “weird” or “rude” drive me, I fail others as well\nas myself. When I focus only on protecting myself, I forget how strong I am, and\nhow wonderful it feels to care for other people. That experience taught me that\nI value protecting other people and being principled and courageous more than I\nvalue fitting in or being invisible—but that I am often tempted to succumb to\nthose desires anyway. When I listen to my values, my life is more fulfilling and\nmeaningful. I feel more powerful, and less stuck. This memory also illustrates\nfor me that it’s my Autism, not my mask, that helps me live in accordance with\nmy beliefs. I was able to step in and help that woman because I was willing to\nmake the situation awkward, and I was stubborn and forceful enough to stand my\nground in the face of aggression and intimidation. These qualities might at\ntimes make me inconvenient to neurotypical people, but sometimes getting in the\nway is exactly the right thing to do.\n\n\nFEELING GRATITUDE FOR YOUR AUTISM—AND YOUR PAST\n\nSo far in this chapter, we’ve worked on rethinking unfair beliefs we have\ninternalized about Autism, and about ourselves. This can be an empowering\nprocess, but it comes with some melancholy as well. You might find yourself\nlooking back on all the years you “wasted” masking and regret how you let shame\nand social judgment shape you. To help work through those challenging feelings,\nit’s useful to extend a little self-gratitude your own way, and take stock of\nthe positive impact Autism has already had on your life. Being Autistic in a\nneurotypical world is often traumatizing,[21] and being forced to mask is\nessentially an experience of society-driven abuse. Though you may sometimes wish\nthat life had been different or that you hadn’t been made to suffer, your\ndisability isn’t to blame for what happened, and neither are you. It was a\nfar-reaching, centuries-old system of injustice that left you in such a\ndifficult spot. Even knowing that, you might feel immense regret about the way\nlife has gone so far. But psychological research shows that extending gratitude\nto your past, trauma-surviving self is a powerful means of healing.[22]\n\nQuite often, people who have coped with trauma in imperfect ways experience a\nfragmentation of selfhood. They see different feelings and behaviors as almost\ndistinct parts of themselves, rather than an integrated whole they can make\nsense of and have control over. The person they were at school may not line up\nwith who they had to pretend to be at home. They may have needed to create a\ncomplex tapestry of social fictions to keep their lives together. It’s easy to\nfeel shame about having coped in that way. But extending gratitude to your past\nself and taking stock of how Autism has shaped your life (even when you were\ntrying to hide it) may help you to feel more unified, as well as more accepting\nof the way things were.\n\nMy friend James Finn is a novelist, former Act Up activist, and retired defense\nanalyst with the U.S. Air Force. He’s worn many hats in his fifty-eight years of\nlife, and all of them have been well suited to his focused, observant Autistic\nnature. He was only diagnosed ten years ago, so for most of his life he didn’t\nknow why he was so adept at scanning through facts and developing systems that\nhelped organize them, or why he could absorb new languages like a sponge. He\njust naturally gravitated to work that gave him ample time to sit alone,\nprocessing information.\n\n“The Air Force is probably going out and recruiting Autistic analysts,” he tells\nme. “I mean if they’re not, they ought to be. I could geek out on studying data\nsets and making connections and just live in my office, it was wonderful. If it\nweren’t for the FBI coming in and doing random polygraphs one year and me having\nto lie about being gay, I probably would have stayed in the military.”\n\nAfter leaving the Air Force in the 1980s, James took a job doing translation\nwork for the United Nations. As the AIDS crisis began to intensify, he became\ninvolved with an HIV/AIDS service agency, where he got to help queer people and\nintravenous drug users. He lived in New York and remained highly engaged in Act\nUp activism until the late 1990s, when the fight against AIDS was finally\nbeginning to look less bleak. From there, James moved to Montreal to live with a\nboyfriend, and began working in sales. He spent his downtime learning French,\nobsessively writing and rewriting translations in a notebook.\n\n“And that is actually one of the things that tipped my therapist off I might be\nAutistic,” James says. “I had five notebooks that were filled with French\nphrases on one side, translated three different ways into English on the other\nside. I told my therapist this and he gave me this look and raised his eyebrows\nlike, I’m sorry, what?”\n\nJames got assessed pretty quickly thereafter, and found out that he was, in\nfact, Autistic. The previous forty-eight years of his life instantly made sense.\nAt his sales job, James used to spend hours typing out transcripts of\nhypothetical dialogue, gaming out every possible way the conversation might go.\nThat way, no matter what someone said, he’d have prepared a way to respond.\nToday, his fiction readers tell him he’s fantastic at writing dialogue, and\nreally understands how other people speak and feel. But it’s not because these\nthings come naturally to him. He devoted thousands of hours to picking\nconversations apart to make sense of them.\n\n“Autism has caused me a lot of challenges throughout my life and a lot of times\nI don’t like it,” James says. “But without it I wouldn’t have been the manager\nof an HIV service organization. I wouldn’t have written novels. I wouldn’t have\nlearned French. So, even though sometimes I feel lonely and even though\nsometimes I feel like people misjudge me, it’s all kind of worth it, too.”\n\nI hear this kind of thinking expressed by Autistic people a lot, especially\nthose who have found community alongside other neurodiverse people and have had\ntime to make peace with who they really are. After the initial shock of\nrealizing you have a hidden disability, there are often waves of acceptance and\nrelief.\n\nIn Autistic self-advocacy circles, the question of whether we’d take a pill that\nmagically “cures” Autism often comes up. The vast majority of people in our\ncommunity reject that question out of hand, because Autism is a core part of who\nwe are, impossible to separate from our personalities, talents, preferences, and\ngeneral outlook. We wouldn’t be the same people without it. Being Autistic has\nfundamentally shaped James Finn’s life, his career, where’s his lived, his\nrelationships, and his passions, just as being a gay man has. It’s not really\npossible to imagine a James Finn that lacks these traits and is still\nrecognizably him.\n\nFor my part, I know that without Autism I wouldn’t have completed my PhD at age\ntwenty-five; I wouldn’t have memorized thousands of song lyrics, befriended\ndozens of genderqueer weirdos with nerdy interests, or written anywhere near as\nmany words as I have. If Autism hadn’t made it hard for me to drive, I might not\nhave moved to Chicago. I might have chosen to live in a city without public\ntransit, and wouldn’t have met my partner of over a decade. Each aspect of who I\nam is tightly interwoven with the rest, and on good days I love myself enough to\nbe grateful for almost every single one.\n\nTo wrap up this chapter, I’d like to ask you to reflect on the meaningful things\nAutism has already brought into your own life. These positives don’t have to be\nrespectable by neurotypical standards. Most of us aren’t genius savants, and our\nworth should not be measured by our ability (or inability) to meet conventional\nbenchmarks of success. What’s really important here is to focus on how\nneurodiversity has brought pleasure, connection, and meaning to your life.\nAutism cannot be “cured,” and most people in the Autism self-advocacy community\neventually come to see that fact as a blessing, because Autism is so core to\ntheir existence, and integral to becoming the wonderful people that they are.\n\nThanks to Autistic hyperfocus, I’ve developed these skills:\n\nThanks to my special interests, I’ve learned a lot about these subjects:\n\nIf I wasn’t Autistic, I never would have gotten to know these people who are\nimportant to me:\n\nIf I wasn’t Autistic, I never would have had these experiences:\n\nIf I wasn’t Autistic, I wouldn’t have these awesome personality traits:\n\nBeing Autistic is hard, but it has made me resilient in these ways:\n\nTo download this chart, go to http://prhlink.com/9780593235249a004.\n\nSelf-stigma is a liar; you’re not cringey, “too much,” a baby, or a cold-blooded\ncreep. You’re a marginalized person with many beautiful and unique qualities.\nYour needs are value-neutral, and your emotions are helpful signals to respond\nto that don’t merit any shame. Autism has always been a powerful driving force\nin your life, often for the better, even when you did not know that it was\nthere. Now that you do know it’s there, you can work on accepting and loving the\nperson you have always been beneath your mask, and practice sharing that version\nof you with the world. Unmasking doesn’t happen in one big burst of confidence;\nit’s a gradual process of relaxing your inhibitions, trusting your feelings, and\nletting go of compensatory strategies that no longer suit you. In the next\nchapter, we’ll look at ways you can reduce the camouflaging and compensating\nthat you do, reject neurotypical expectations, and construct a lifestyle that\ncenters your neurotype instead of downplaying it."},{"title":"Test Section Title","content":"CHAPTER 4\n\n\nTHE COST OF MASKING\n\n“I’m pretty sure my dad was Autistic,” Thomas tells me. “I think his drug use\nwas a way to blunt the world’s edges.”\n\nThomas is a programmer and he was diagnosed as Autistic a few years ago. For\nmuch of his life before that, he relied on alcohol just as his father had relied\non drugs. Getting drunk was the only way he could move through the world with\nany degree of comfort.\n\n“When I was in my teens, I found that having a couple drinks in me allowed me to\nperceive myself differently. I had more confidence and felt more social. But\nmore importantly it dulled the razor-sharp edges of reality enough where I could\nbe in a crowded loud area. Because I really couldn’t bring myself to do that\nwithout alcohol.”\n\nTo neurotypical people, Thomas often seems like a “high-functioning” person. But\nthere has always been immense turmoil simmering beneath the surface. In college\nhe nearly attained a 4.0 GPA—then dropped out very suddenly, because he couldn’t\nhandle the social aspects of school. A few years later, he had a good job and\ncould maintain a sixty-hour workweek, but was sneaking drinks and coming to work\nhungover. He had a partner, but they barely spoke to one another. His home life\nwas a mess. Through it all, he remained convinced that alcohol was the only\nthing keeping him sane. He couldn’t fall asleep without it, desperately needed\nit to prop up his otherwise unsustainable life masquerading as a neurotypical\nperson. Soon that life would all begin to crumble, and he’d be forced to finally\nconfront why he (and his father) had always fallen back on substances in order\nto make life bearable.\n\nResearch shows that Autistics who mask tend to suffer from intense social\nanxiety,[1] and some of us learn to self-medicate that anxiety with drugs or\nalcohol. We may also reach for substances to help blunt our sensory issues or\nhelp us pretend to be more confident. Alcohol, weed, and other depressants are\nalso an appealing and socially acceptable way of unwinding after a stressful day\nof constantly gaming out how every move we make will be received by other\npeople.\n\nMasked Autistic people fall back on a variety of flawed strategies in order to\nrelax, mute our most disruptive behaviors, or conform with neurotypical\nstandards. Some use compulsive exercise or calorie restriction to make their\njittery, unruly Autistic bodies settle down or shrink into a more convenient\nshape. Some self-harm in order to regulate their anxiety or sensory overwhelm.\nOthers become so lonesome they seek out approval from high-control groups and\ncults, or find themselves trapped in abusive domestic relationships they are\nunable to escape. Even many mental health professionals are unaware that these\ndisorders and self-destructive behaviors are highly comorbid with Autism. The\nstereotype that Autistic people are withdrawn “losers” who just sit at home on\nthe computer all day runs very deep, and it prevents many of us from recognizing\nourselves and understanding the roots of our struggles. It’s hard for many\nmasked Autistic people to recognize that being a hard-drinking party animal who\nroutinely gets swept away in abusive relationships can be a sign they are\nstruggling with an unrecognized disability. When we compensate in those ways, we\noften believe it’s because we’re just toxic, weak-willed people.\n\nBelow is a table listing some of the problematic coping strategies that research\nshows masked Autistics fall back on, and a few bullet points explaining why we\ntend to reach for them.\n\n\nPROPPING UP THE MASK:\n\n\nPROBLEMATIC COPING STRATEGIES AND WHY MASKED AUTISTICS USE THEM\n\nProblem Drinking or Substance Use\n\n• Dulls sensory sensitivities\n\n• Provides “liquid courage” for intimidating social situations\n\n• Relaxes inhibitions and filters\n\n• Provides energy to get through an overly demanding world\n\n• Stimulates the senses\n\n• Entertains an anxious or preoccupied mind\n\n• Silences the inner critic\n\nEating-Disordered Behavior\n\n• Grounds life in daily goals and rituals\n\n• Provides physical stimulation via hunger, exercise, purging, etc.\n\n• Distracts from social struggles by focusing on the body\n\n• Defines “goodness” and “worthiness” in terms of behavior or appearance\n\n• Gives the Autistic person a sense of self-control or discipline\n\n• Explains away feelings of gender dysphoria or physical dissociation\n\nDetachment and Dissociation\n\n• Prevents rejection by disengaging first\n\n• Blunts painful emotions such as grief, sorrow, and regret\n\n• Allows the Autistic person to focus only on what they’re naturally “good” at\n\n• Removes the pressure to learn challenging emotional or social skills\n\n• Silences needs and emotions others find bothersome\n\n• Preserves limited energy\n\nAdherence to Rigid Rules and Belief Systems\n\n• Makes a confusing reality feel more understandable and concrete\n\n• Translates vague social norms into specific expectations\n\n• Creates an in-group to which the Autistic person can belong\n\n• Provides daily structure and soothing rituals\n\n• Soothes self-doubt and fears about being a “bad person”\n\n• Promises salvation from the present, unjust world\n\n“Fawning” and Compulsive People-Pleasing\n\n• Earns the Autistic person praise\n\n• Offers a false promise of acceptance\n\n• Simplifies complicated relationship dynamics\n\n• Flattens social interactions into one easy rule: always say “yes”\n\n• Validates the Autistic person’s belief they should ignore their feelings and\nneeds\n\n• Minimizes conflict and reduces anger\n\nAs you look over this list of behaviors, bear in mind that the line between\n“good” coping and “bad” coping is often blurry, and there’s no shame in having\nused imperfect strategies in order to survive. A method that may have worked\npretty harmlessly for a while, like drinking a beer before going out with\nfriends, may sometimes morph into something more compulsive, like sneaking\ndrinks at work. Or drinking might only become a problem during times of high\nstress. Excessive exercise can be both a useful way to calm yourself down when\nyou’re on the verge of a meltdown, and a compulsive habit that is damaging your\njoints. These things aren’t binary. Sometimes we are forced by circumstance to\nignore our physical and mental health because maintaining our job or housing\nsituation is the most pressing thing. When we lack a clear understanding of our\ndisability, and no one around us recognizes us as disabled, we make do the best\nwe can.\n\nIn this chapter, we’ll get to meet a variety of masked Autistic people who have\nused elaborate, at times flawed strategies to maintain their masks. They’ve\noverexercised or drugged their way into social acceptance; some of them have\nspent years detached from other people, or sought out belonging in reactionary\ngroups. These individuals have come to recognize that in addition to protecting\nthem from social rejection, masking has gotten in the way of them leading\nauthentic, happy lives. They’ve also begun to reexamine their coping mechanisms,\naiming to identify the unmet needs they can satisfy with more appropriate\ndisability accommodations, rather than self-destructiveness and denial.\n\n\nPROBLEM DRINKING AND SUBSTANCE USE\n\nAs he grew older and he became even more reliant upon alcohol in order to “stay\nsane,” Thomas’s life began unspooling. He had grown resentful of his partner,\nand they were looking into breaking up. Around this same time, Thomas quit his\njob, and attempted suicide. Then he moved across the country for another job,\nbut quit it pretty shortly thereafter. He kept fantasizing about death, seeing\nit as the only way out of an existence that had become utterly unmanageable. The\ntherapists Thomas saw during this period diagnosed him with Bipolar Disorder and\nBorderline Personality Disorder, because his relationships were unstable and his\nemotions sometimes became explosive, in addition to him experiencing long\nperiods of depression. He kept trying to get sober but couldn’t make it work.\n\n“Literally, it took me six months to get my first thirty-day coin [in Alcoholics\nAnonymous],” he says. “And even then, I was still very unhappy. During that\ncrazy summer of repeated relapse and plotting of my own death, my ex put me in\ncontact with a new therapist.”\n\nThomas’s ex-partner was a social worker and had recently attended a panel about\nAutism Spectrum Disorder while at a conference. He was struck by how much one\npanelist’s description of Autism mirrored his experiences being with Thomas. The\npanelist turned out to be a therapist, and Thomas’s ex put the two in touch.\nWith the help of a therapist who actually understood the comorbidity between\nAutism and alcoholism, Thomas was finally able to make progress in dealing with\nhis addiction.\n\n“I came to figure out I have had massive social anxiety and sensory issues all\nmy life, and I was using alcohol to numb them,” Thomas explains.\n\nOne of the most common and subtly debilitating experiences Autistics have is\nsensory overwhelm. I’ve already described how the bottom-up nature of Autistic\nsensory processing leads to us being overstimulated and easily distracted by\nthings like ambient noise and visual clutter. There is an additional\nneurological feature of Autism that contributes to our sensory issues and\nmeltdowns in a significant way—our difficulty adjusting to a stimulus over time.\n\nNeurotypical brains engage in sensory adaptation and habituation: the longer\nthey are in the presence of a sound, smell, texture, or visual cue, the more\ntheir brain learns to ignore it, and allow it to fade into the background. Their\nneurons become less likely to be activated by a cue the longer they are around\nit. The exact opposite is true for Autistic people: the longer we are around a\nstimulus, the more it bothers us.[2] As I’ve already mentioned, our neurons are\nalso “hyperexcitable,” meaning our senses get set off more easily by small input\nthat neurotypicals don’t even notice, such as a hair falling into our face or a\npile of mail being left on our desk.[3] We’re better at noticing small details\nand changes in our environment,[4] which can be a real advantage for meticulous\nwork (like programming, Thomas’s profession), but we are also more prone to\nbeing startled or distracted.[5]\n\nWhen an Autistic person is flooded with upsetting sensory information for too\nlong, they enter a state of sensory overload. Sensory overload can look like a\ntemper tantrum or a crying fit, it can take the form of a shutdown or meltdown,\nor it can present as the Autistic person becoming confused and responding to\nquestions in routinized or nonsensical ways. Sensory overload makes it hard to\ncomplete complex tasks, think through things rationally, or manage emotions.\nWhen we’re overloaded, we become irritable, or filled with despair; we might\neven start self-harming to get an endorphin rush or ground ourselves. Our bodies\nare visibly tense with anxiety, and we’re difficult to engage with during these\ntimes. What non-Autistic folks often don’t realize is that Autistic people\nexperience intense sensory input as if it were physical pain.[6]\n\nUnfortunately, when an Autistic person complains about the sensory pain they’re\nin, people think they’re being overly dramatic, needy, or even downright\n“crazy.” I can’t fully convey how frustrating it is to be in deep distress over\na persistent noise my boyfriend can’t even hear. When I find myself stomping\naround the house anxiously, pounding on the floor with a broom to get my\nneighbor to turn down her music, I feel like I’m being “crazy.” My partner knows\nI’m not making this stuff up, and he tries his best to be accommodating and\npatient. But for most of my life, people were unsympathetic to my sensory\ncomplaints. They acted as if I chose to be distracted and furious every day.\n\nIn response to sensory overload I’ve yelled, and sobbed, and needed to be held;\nI’ve tried punching pillows, hitting myself on the arms and legs with a\nhairbrush, running away from people, and hitting myself in the head. Very few of\nthese reactions are socially acceptable, so I’ve mostly resorted to them in\nprivate. In recent years, I’ve learned how to prevent these meltdowns before\nthey occur, by giving myself lots of quiet time alone, and extricating myself\nfrom stressful situations before they make me bubble up with anxiety. The second\nI feel myself suppressing frustration that I feel I don’t deserve to voice, I\nknow I need to get out of the area. However, once a true meltdown hits there’s\nvery little I can do—I need to either escape the situation, or find an outlet\nfor all my energy. Drinking is really the only release valve neurotypical people\ncan respect—as long as you present it as a fun habit, rather than a compulsion.\n\nMany Autistic adults report problematic drinking habits, or substance use\ndisorders.[7] Dulling our sensory sensitivities is one of the key reasons for\nthis link.[8] Another reason is that substances assist us with social\nregulation. When you’re used to carefully monitoring and modulating your actions\nall the time, a stiff drink can help you let your guard down, and momentarily\nrelax.[9] Social norms are loosened when people are drinking. Drunk allistic\npeople talk for too long and interrupt one another, too! If you say something\nweird at a party, drunk people might forget it even happened. The ease of being\naround other drunk people can itself be kind of intoxicating. Unfortunately,\nrelying on substances in order to feel at ease or connected can rapidly become\nself-destructive.\n\nThe 2020 Netflix series The Queen’s Gambit depicts the life of Beth Harmon, a\nfictional chess prodigy living in the mid-twentieth century. Beth is heavily\ncoded as Autistic.[10] She’s blunt and analytical, with little time for other\npeople’s emotions. She confronts her opponents with a cool, almost reptilian\nstare, and rattles off chess facts and move sets in an obsessive, flat monotone\nmany Autistic viewers instantly found recognizable. She’s also addicted to\nsedative pills, and drinks heavily. Unlike most Autistic characters on TV, Beth\nisn’t just a hypercompetent nerd; she’s a wild, free spirit who compulsively\nuses drugs, shoplifting, and sex to keep herself stimulated. Her\nself-destructive habits are also part of her mask: she disarms her chauvinistic\nmale competitors and superficial classmates by seeming cool and wild.\n\nI’ve never related to an Autistic character quite as much as Beth. Like her (and\nlike Thomas) I spent my teen and early adult years racking up achievements while\nabsolutely wrecking my personal life. In high school I’d black out drunk during\nthe day sometimes, slipping vodka into my Gatorade in the high school parking\nlot to win the approval of my friends. I skipped class, forged early dismissal\npaperwork to get out of orchestra, and shoplifted frequently. At one point I was\nnearly expelled, but I was spared when a sympathetic school administrator “lost”\nmy expulsion paperwork with a wink.\n\nI didn’t get in much trouble for my bad behavior because I was earning A’s and\nwas a nationally ranked debate team competitor. The same insouciant,\nsmart-but-self-destructive energy carried me through my early twenties. In early\nadulthood I got into a lot of messy, destructive relationships and self-harmed\nwith nicotine, anorexia, and random hookups. It was all part of the jaded,\n“mature” mask I’d started wearing all the way back in middle school. I thought\nif I was excelling on paper, and living a cool, glamorous life, there was no way\nanyone could ever say I was “childish” or “pathetic.” No one could accuse me of\nbeing too sensitive if I hid my sensory issues by pouring Amaretto into my\ncoffee and drinking during developmental psych. I never had the alcohol\ntolerance to become an addict (I threw up far too easily for that), but if that\nhadn’t been the case, I might have easily ended up on the same path as Thomas.\n\nEventually, Beth Harmon’s drinking turns from glamorous to grim. She uses some\nof her closest male friends for sex and then dismisses them; she alienates her\nentire support network, botches a few crucial chess matches because she’s\nhungover, and resigns herself to padding drunkenly throughout her filthy home,\noverlining her eyes with kohl while taking pulls from a wine bottle. The\npartying and self-destruction that was once her social crutch slips out from\nunder her, just as it did for Thomas and myself. Unlike us, though, Beth’s\nfictional downward spiral doesn’t lead to seeking out therapy or arriving at an\nAutism diagnosis. She’s a beautiful, accomplished, unhappy woman living in the\n1950s. No one knows how to name her troubles yet.\n\nUnderstanding the physical, sensory, emotional, or psychological needs that\nyou’ve been trying to meet with your substance use may help you identify other,\nmore beneficial coping strategies. A survey of more than five hundred Autistic\nadults published in the journal Autism in Adulthood found that the most commonly\nreported reasons for binge drinking were social reasons, and to boost positive\nfeelings.[11] Alcoholism and substance use can mask Autism super effectively,\nbecause most people still believe Autistics are buttoned-up geeks who prefer to\nstay home. If you’ve been unaware of your disability for a long time, or been in\ndenial about it, you may have used getting high or drunk to cover up your\nsuffering, or to give you the energy to socialize. You may believe, for example,\nthat you can’t be interesting or fun without the aid of substances. If you have\ntrauma related to abuse you’ve endured as a masked Autistic person (or from\nother sources), you might use substances to self-medicate post-traumatic stress.\n\nWhen a substance use disorder co-occurs alongside other mental health\nconditions, such as post-traumatic stress or depression, research shows most\npatients prefer and benefit from an integrated treatment approach that addresses\nthe multiple, interlocking issues at the same time.[12] Autism isn’t a disorder\nthat needs to be treated, but most Autistic people do have mental health\nstruggles related to living in an unaccepting neurotypical world. For Autistic\npeople who do have substance addictions, exploring an integrated treatment\nprogram is likely to be a good fit.\n\nIf you suspect you have an unhealthy relationship to drugs or alcohol, it will\nbe important to identify a treatment method that suits your neurotype, or find a\nmental health provider who has experience with Autistics. Since a growing body\nof research suggests cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) approaches don’t work as\nwell for Autistics as they do for neurotypicals,[13] CBT-based addiction\ntreatment might not be a good fit—at least not without modifications. One\nexploratory clinical study published in 2019 did find that when mental health\nproviders were taught about how to communicate effectively with Autistic\npatients (a skill set most providers lack), the cognitive behavioral therapy\nthey offered did help Autistic adults with their substance use disorders.[14]\n\nUnfortunately, most care providers are not well informed about how Autistic\npeople think and communicate, and there is very little published research into\nwhich addiction treatment programs consistently work best for adult Autistics.\nMany of the effective treatment plans that do assist Autistic adults involve\nmaking sure our health care, housing, and other material needs are also being\nmet, in addition to ensuring we are plugged into a network of supportive people.\nOften the fears that CBT therapists train their patients to view as irrational\n(if I say the wrong thing, I’ll lose my job and wind up on the street!) are\ncompletely rational for Autistics, and rooted in genuine experience.\n\nIn Thomas’s case, cutting back on alcohol laid bare the sensory sensitivities\nand anxiety that lingered underneath. It also rapidly became clear that he\ncouldn’t maintain a high-stress, high-stimulation job that would be more likely\nto provoke him to drink. Today he manages his sensory issues using\nnoise-canceling headphones, and he forces himself to take regular breaks away\nfrom busy, noisy settings. He’s working from home, and learning to recognize\nwhen he’s getting overloaded by anxiety or noise. There’s less need for him to\ncamouflage his Autistic traits now, and thus less desire to drink. He’s now been\ncompletely sober for several years.\n\nFor many Autistic people, taming a fraught relationship with substances may\nnecessitate getting comfortable with being more visibly Autistic, which can be a\nvery slow process. In their essay “Alcohol: An Autistic Masking Tool?”[15] Jesse\nMeadows describes their relationship to unmasking and sobriety this way:\n\n“I made friends by drinking. Alcohol gave me dating and adventures and sex.\nWithout it, all of these things are much harder, some of them impossible. I\ndon’t leave the house very much anymore. In a lot of ways, I became a more\nautistic person when I got sober.”\n\nThe flip side of this can sometimes be true. In order to get sober, sometimes\nyou have to be willing to be more Autistic.\n\n\nEATING-DISORDERED BEHAVIOR\n\nDorian Bridges is a horror writer and YouTuber whose channel, Of Herbs and\nAltars, features discussions about early 2000s alternative fashion and culture,\neating disorder and drug addiction recovery, and issues in the Autism and\nAsperger’s communities. In the early 2000s, Dorian was an undiagnosed Aspie[16]\nteenager who was struggling socially and in school. In one especially poignant\nvideo, Dorian describes how growing up without a diagnosis fundamentally changed\nthe course of their life.[17]\n\n“I knew innately from a very young age I find life harder than other people,”\nthey say, “but there was never any reason. It was always just you are lazy; you\nare being lazy.”\n\nDorian says they had many clear Asperger’s Syndrome traits. They inhaled books\nand sat off alone in the corner at family gatherings. They spoke “like a\nthesaurus” and did well on IQ tests, but found daily classwork hard to keep up\nwith. But like so many other masked Autistics, they were seen as a “girl,” and\nwere assumed to be gifted and a little weird, rather than disabled.\n\n“My parents were told, there’s nothing wrong with your kid…. Your child is going\nto go far! Your child has nothing that’s going to ever get in their way.”\n\nMany masked Autistics are sent to gifted education as children, instead of being\nreferred to disability services.[18] Our apparent high intelligence puts us in a\ndouble bind: we are expected to accomplish great things to justify our oddness,\nand because we possess an enviable, socially prized quality, it’s assumed we\nneed less help than other people, not more. Dorian couldn’t handle the pressure\nof such high expectations, or the lack of compassion. So they began to\nself-harm. At age thirteen, they happened upon a magazine article about a girl\nwith anorexia and felt incredibly envious. This visibly sick girl was being\nshowered with affection and care. She wasn’t expected to excel at anything but\nstaying alive.\n\n“What I got from this article was this girl made herself so close to death that\nher family were afraid they were going to lose her, and now she has all this\nlove and support around her. And she doesn’t have to achieve anything, because\nshe nearly died,” Dorian says.\n\nDorian held on to this article for years, rereading it until they had it nearly\nmemorized. They began to starve themselves, hoping that if they looked like they\nwere dying, people would finally go easy on them. They also started frequenting\npro-anorexia (or “pro Ana”) forums, where they befriended other eating\ndisordered teens and traded weight loss strategies and “thinspiration” photos.\nEventually they began meeting up in person and having binge-purge parties.\nDorian says this community was filled with self-destructive people who were\noften a bad influence on one another, but also that it was the only\nnonjudgmental place they had access to, the only space where they could truly\nlet their pain show.[19]\n\nMy own eating disorder had different motivations than Dorian’s did, but it was\nno less tied to my Autism. From age fifteen until about twenty-five, I denied\nmyself food because I wanted to look “androgynous,” and I believed that meant\nlooking thin. I overexercised because I thought it proved I was strong. The pain\nof an empty stomach was physically satisfying to me; the throb in my legs after\ntwo hours of playing Dance Dance Revolution on calorie counter mode made me feel\nlike I’d finally reined in an out-of-control body. Unlike Dorian, I didn’t want\npeople to know I was having a hard time. Ever. I wanted to be an otherworldly\ncreature, free from silly human needs. I pulled a lot of all-nighters, thinking\nthat staying up late exercising was a better use of my time than rest. When a\nfriend on the debate team told me that I seemed like a “robot” because I never\nseemed to sleep, eat, or like people, I felt an immense sense of triumph. My\nmask was solid steel.\n\nAutism and eating disorders are highly correlated, especially among women,[20]\ntrans people,[21] and maskers diagnosed late in life. A lot of factors account\nfor this. Some maskers believe that being conventionally pretty and thin will\nhelp them blend in. Others neglect their physical needs because they’ve mentally\ndetached from their bodies. Purging can be used to self-harm, or to regulate a\ndisrupted sensory system. It floods the body with endorphins, which can be\ncalming and addictive. In one video, Dorian describes how a friend from the\npro-Ana forums used to pace her hallway all night, every night, in a desperate\nbid to burn calories. This sounds a lot like a repetitive self-stimulatory\nbehavior,[22] in addition to a purge. My compulsive DDR playing was absolutely a\nsneaky way to self-stimulate, as well as an attempt to lose weight.\n\nSome masked Autistics are drawn to the structure and sense of control that an\neating disorder can provide. We often seek out clear “rules” for good behavior,\nwhich we then adhere to rigidly, hoping they will keep us socially safe and\nfinally render us worthy.[23] When I was an undiagnosed Autistic teen, my brain\nwas constantly buzzing with vague anxiety. Calories, checking my body in the\nmirror, and weighing myself were concrete things I could focus on instead of\ninchoate fear. The fatphobic society I was living in had taught me that being\nthin was superior to being fat, and I attempted to follow that rule with fervor.\nRunning myself ragged with exercise meant I’d eventually be able to fall asleep.\nThe online eating disorder community gave me routines to craft my day around.\n\nIt was all quasi-religious. I didn’t believe in God, but I could worship at the\naltar of Dance Dance Revolution every night, sweating and gulping down ice water\nwhile my brain floated above me in a nutrient-deprived haze. Exercise bulimia\nalso gave me a way of connecting with the girls around me. Wanting to be thin\nwas one of the few gender-conforming traits I had.\n\nClinical research has found that somewhere between 20 and 37 percent of\ndiagnosed anorexia nervosa sufferers are Autistic.[24] Since Autism is\nunderdiagnosed in the populations who are most likely to be diagnosed with\neating disorders (women, trans people, and gay men), the actual rate of\nco-occurrence might be much higher. In conventional eating disorder treatment,\nAutistic patients have worse outcomes: they require longer hospital stays, are\nless likely to reduce their eating disordered behaviors, and experience more\ndepression and social isolation in recovery groups.[25] However, eating disorder\nclinics and inpatient programs have started taking steps to accommodate their\nAutistic patients, with some promising results. Here’s how Tchanturia and\ncolleagues (2020)[26] described their newly Autism-friendly eating disorder\nward:\n\n> We invested in materials necessary to create a more [Autism-] friendly ward\n> environment, including redecorating the ward to create a neutral colour\n> scheme, developing a “sensory box” for patients with items such as weighted\n> blankets and sensory toys, and we began hosting wellbeing groups for autistic\n> patients and for those without autistic traits together with members of the\n> multi-disciplinary team to support sensory difficulties and enhance social\n> communication (e.g., introducing communication passports and other\n> strategies).\n\nTchanturia and colleagues found that Autistic patients on this accessible ward\nhad significantly shorter stays, and follow-up research suggests Autism-friendly\neating disorder treatment does result in better outcomes.[27] Since\neating-disordered behavior is at least partially socially motivated for many\nAutistic people, it may also be beneficial to seek belonging and social\nstructure in new ways that feel less performative and most authentic. In their\nvideos, Dorian says that their health was at its worst when they tried to seem\nlike a normal, perky, preppily dressed woman.[28] Presenting as a transmasculine\ngoth with loud outfits and intense makeup helps them feel far more at home in\ntheir body, and hanging out with other “weird” alternative types gives them the\nsense of belonging they once sought in pro-Ana groups. Now that they know\nthey’re Autistic, they’re also able to be more vulnerable about when and why\nthey’re struggling, so they don’t have to use a shared compulsion to bond with\nother people.\n\n\nDETACHMENT AND DISSOCIATION\n\nTo cope with the pressure of masking, many Autistics disappear into our own\nheads. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve heard an Autistic person say they\nwish they could just be a floating brain in a jar, or a dark, sentient mist with\nno physical form. It’s a common neurodivergent fantasy, because our bodies can\nseem so at odds with what the world wants them to be. Dissociation is also a\nmeans of controlling the social and sensory data we’re taking in, ignoring\ninputs that have become too intense. For example, when there are too many people\naround, my friend Angel says he goes away into “Angel World” in his head, and\neveryone around him becomes blurry. He has some relatives that he has never seen\nthe faces of, because he’s only ever met them at big family gatherings where\neveryone blends into a sea of muddy, vague shapes. When he’s dissociating, he\ncan still go through the motions of eating, bathing, and walking around, but\nmentally he’s not really there.\n\nThe only thing that brings Angel back is having plenty of time to rest and\ndisengage. For other Autistic people that I know, including myself, having to\nmask and socialize for an extended period increases the odds we’ll begin to\ndissociate or shut down. People don’t literally become “blurry” for me when I’m\noverwhelmed, but I do stop gazing at people’s faces and often fail to recognize\npeople I know or hear their voices unless they get in my face and wave their\nhands. Putting less cognitive effort into masking can help, as can escaping the\noverloading situation that was provoking me to detach in the first place.\n\nIn the short term, mentally detaching works great. It frees up a lot of energy\nand attention, so we can focus on activities we’re good at, or think only about\nthe ideas that capture our interest. But in the long term, retreating inward\nalienates us from our needs even more. Some research suggests that Autistic\npeople have a diminished sense of agency; in other words, we feel less in\ncontrol of ourselves and our bodies than non-Autistic people do.[29] A lifetime\nof being corrected for incompetence and childishness affects our self-concept,\nand makes it hard for us to develop basic skills of self-advocacy or\nassertiveness.\n\nIn one study of Autistic agency, Autistic and non-Autistic people were both\nasked to manipulate a cursor on a screen as part of a computer game.[30] Random\ntime lags and movement glitches were added to the game, so that players didn’t\nalways have full control over what the mouse was doing. Players were told to\nattempt to win the game, and were also asked to report when they thought they\nhad control of the mouse and when they didn’t. Neurotypical people were pretty\naccurate in judging when they had control of the mouse. They could tell when a\nmouse movement was caused by a lag or glitch rather than their own hands.\nAutistic players instead struggled to tell the difference. They tended to\nbelieve they were more in control of the game when they were winning, and that\nthey were not in control when they were losing, even when the two were\nunrelated. In particular, this result appeared to be driven by Autistic people\ntrusting internal cues less: they didn’t trust their own feelings of whether\nthey were in control or not, so much as external benchmarks of success in the\ngame.\n\nThis may be a bit of a contrived example from a laboratory setting, but it\npoints to a tendency many of us have to view ourselves as powerless, and\nfundamentally detached from our bodies and the broader world. We rely on\nexternal signs of success (winning a game, getting praised by another person) to\nguide us, rather than trusting our perceptions and power of discernment.\n\nUnfortunately, when we disengage from our bodies, we miss out on a lot of\nvaluable self-protective physical signals. Research shows that most Autistic\npeople have a reduced sense of the body’s warning signals, or interoception.[31]\nMost of us tend to feel like our bodies are not really our own, and struggle to\ndraw connections between the external world and how we feel inside.[32] For\nexample, a neurotypical person might notice that their coworkers are leaving for\nlunch, and then check in with their own body and recognize they’re hungry, too.\nAn Autistic person might instead be lost in their own head, and fail to draw a\nconnection between their coworkers departing and the need to check for hunger\nwithin themselves. It’s unclear how much this is caused by a neurological\nfeature of Autism, and how much it’s a by-product of masking and social\npressure. After all, masked Autistics are socially conditioned to silence the\nphysical needs we do notice. If I have to suppress my desire to pace around the\nroom and sing songs to myself because doing so makes me look like a “freak,” how\nam I supposed to know that listening to hunger or tiredness is fine?\n\nThough Autistic people tend to be hypersensitive to sensory input, most are\nrelatively numb to physical pain.[33] It may sound paradoxical, but it makes\nsense when you recall the research showing that Autistic brains are generally\ndetail oriented and hyperexcitable. When my shirt gets untucked, I cannot stand\nthe little burst of cool air I feel hitting my belly. It’s a persistent, small\nstimulus that is too annoying to ignore. Yet I’ve walked for miles with bleeding\nfissures on my heels and barely felt a thing. Masking also tends to involve\nswallowing your anguish in order to keep the neurotypicals around you happy.\nComplaining about discomfort that no one else is experiencing can make you seem\n“crazy” or “demanding.” Many of us become quite adept at ignoring pain, just as\nwe neglect our own hunger or thirst.\n\nUnfortunately, this isn’t just true of physical pain. It extends to emotional\npain, too. Research by psychologist Geoff Bird indicates that about half of all\nAutistics suffer from alexithymia,[34] or the inability to recognize and name\nemotions.[35] For those of us with alexithymia, we may know in a vague way that\nwe’re distressed, but might not be able to name a specific feeling like jealousy\nor resentment. We also struggle to figure out why we’re feeling emotions. This\ntrait is yet another reason that neurotypicals stereotype us as unfeeling and\ndetached.\n\nAlexithymia may arise, in part, because Autistics aren’t given the tools to\nunderstand how emotions feel in our bodies, and because we are taught to\nprioritize others’ feelings above our own. Growing up, we’re told how\nneurotypical emotions look and feel. We’re encouraged to track other people for\nsigns of discomfort or disapproval, so we can change our actions and become more\npleasant or compliant. Our own facial expressions, nonverbal signals, and\nperceptions of our bodies and surroundings are different, and neurotypicals\nfrequently ignore them. So when we’re upset or uncomfortable, we often fail to\nrecognize it until we’re nearly on the verge of a complete meltdown. As we begin\nto unmask, we stop monitoring the reactions of other people so closely and with\nso much hypervigilance; this allows us to check in with our bodies more. Our\nreflexive self-censorship may begin to reduce, allowing us to notice our\ndiscomfort and honor it. However, many Autistic people (myself included) still\nneed time alone to reflect on how we’re feeling, because the social information\ngiven off by other people is so distracting. Today I’m sometimes able to notice\nin the heat of the moment that I’m uncomfortable with the topic of conversation,\nfor instance, or the way someone is pushing me to do something I don’t wish to\ndo, and I can tell them to stop; other days I simply feel panicky and frantic,\nand can’t figure out what’s wrong until hours or days later.\n\nBecause Autistic people often struggle to look after our bodies or to recognize\nand advocate for our needs, work, school, and other social settings can be\nincredibly painful for us to navigate. An oft-cited statistic claims that 85\npercent of Autistic adults are unemployed,[36] though higher-quality\ncross-sectional research puts the number closer to 40 percent.[37] Some research\nsuggests that Autistics who disclose their disability at work often regret\nhaving done so, because they don’t get many useful accommodations and may be\nunderestimated or othered.[38] For these and many other reasons, Autistic people\noften have no choice but to work from home, and as a population we’re digitally\nself-employed at high rates.[39] Work-from-home and consulting positions\nfrequently undercompensate and overwork us, but they offer a level of\nflexibility and privacy that more stable jobs lack.\n\nIn addition to compensating by working from home or pursuing digital work, a\nsignificant percentage of Autism maskers disengage from reality via internet and\ngaming.[40] Digital work and gaming are incredibly appealing to Autistic\npeople’s brains. Online and in games, cause and effect are clearer than in\n“real” life.[41] It’s easy to ignore subtext or nonverbal cues and focus only on\nshared tasks and clear, measurable outcomes. In digital communication, Autistic\npeople get the time we need to carefully process a message, google any terms\nthat are unfamiliar, and carefully reflect on how we might want to respond.\n\nThere’s nothing innately wrong with using the internet to help meet your need\nfor social contact and structure. Disabled people have found community and\nshared resources on the internet for decades. However, excessive and compulsive\ninternet use and gaming can prove damaging to Autistic people and inhibit our\nsocial connections and development.[42] When we spend too much time online, it\ncan limit how much practice we get interacting and communicating out in the\nworld, contribute to feelings of loneliness and depression, and further the\ndetachment so many of us feel from our bodies. Hiding our struggles away from\nthe world is not a productive means of gaining acceptance, and there’s a\ndifference between using the internet as a way to develop a sense of fluency and\ncompetence, and retreating into it because we feel we have no other choice.\n\nThomas tells me that as he’s come to understand his own Autism and work on\nunmasking, he’s gotten better at noticing how he feels and figuring out how to\ncare for himself. For many years, particularly before his diagnosis, he would\njust push his emotions and desires away.\n\n“This week I noticed my energy replenishment was at a standstill,” he says. “I\ncouldn’t focus on data work, which is normally one of my passions. I journaled\nabout it a bit and realized my girlfriend has been home more than usual lately.\nI love her, but being around her all day was overstimulating me. The next day\nthe weather was beautiful, and all I did was sit outside and read. It felt\nwonderful, there wasn’t all this stimuli hyper-activating me.”\n\nThomas still carries the baggage of being fully masked and undiagnosed, and\nthinking he was simply a difficult or angry person. Over the years, though, he’s\nlearned to push past this cultural programming and actually construct a life\nthat’s authentic to him. Building that kind of self-knowledge and acceptance has\nbeen vital to his happiness and his sobriety.\n\n“I enjoy hanging out in train yards, and learning ridiculous amounts of useless\nknowledge, and I’d rather work on jigsaw puzzles than watch TV. Because my life\nis aligned with who I am now, I have much less need to drink. Recovery is\npredicated on aligning your life with your values, and you aren’t going to be\nable to align anything until you know who you are.”\n\nThis is just as true of Autistics who reflexively detach from reality because\nthey’re so accustomed to camouflaging their every feeling and need. You cannot\ncraft a comfortable or worthwhile life if you don’t know who you really are, or\nif your self-image is shaped entirely by rules imposed on you by other people.\nThankfully, it is possible to step away from defining yourself by the approval\nof other people, and by your adherence to society’s rules. In later chapters,\nwe’ll explore how that process can look, and hear from several people who have\nwalked away from a life defined by seeking approval and masking.\n\n\nADHERENCE TO RIGID RULES AND BELIEF SYSTEMS\n\nMasked Autistics sometimes find structure and belonging in “high control”\ngroups, such as radicalized political organizations, religious communities with\nvery restrictive beliefs, and cults. High control groups famously prey on people\nwho are lonely and desperately seek a sense of purpose. Their repetitive\nrituals, seemingly close-knit social bonds, and ironclad rules about who is\n“good” and who is “bad” appeal to isolated people who yearn for connection and\nstructure.\n\nI’ve spoken to a wide array of masked Autistic adults, and over a dozen have\nshared stories with me of belonging to fringe religious communities, conspiracy\ntheory groups, multilevel marketing schemes, and other high control\norganizations. There isn’t any empirical research I can find that documents just\nhow prevalent this is for our population. However, recent research by Griffiths\nand colleagues (2019) does describe Autistic adults as having an elevated\nvulnerability to financial exploitation, domestic violence, relational abuse,\nand emotional manipulation.[43] These are the precise qualities that define\ncults—and they’re part of what makes such spaces alluring to us.\n\nWe’re susceptible to manipulation for tons of reasons. Autistic adults tend to\nbe in socioeconomically precarious positions, which can make it hard for us to\nescape people who mistreat us. When you’re unemployed or underemployed, you’re\ngoing to be more willing to move in with a romantic partner, or become dependent\non an extremist religious group quickly, as a matter of necessity. Our yearning\nto be accepted and tendency to downplay our own feelings also leaves us prone to\nmistreatment. ABA therapy and social masking instruct us to be compliant and\nconformist. Orthodoxy and rules about how we’re supposed to act can feel\ngrounding and “rational.”\n\nGrowing up Autistic in the rural western United States, Andrew found himself\nlured into a controlling religious community. He says members of the church\nquickly identified him as a potential mark.\n\n“I was living alone, clearly one of the only nonwhite people in a very white\nsmall town, depressed, anxious all the time, drinking coffee all day at the\ndiner, and they started talking to me, saying they just wanted to get to know\nme.”\n\nHe was getting “love bombed,” a common technique in cults where new members are\nshowered with excessive affection and special attention.[44] Love bombing trains\na person to let their guard down and relax their boundaries around the new\ngroup. For Autistic people who have been on the fringes of society all our\nlives, it can be exhilarating to suddenly, inexplicably be adored.\n\nOnce Andrew decided to join the church, things began to change. Members kept him\nup on the phone late at night, asking intense questions about his family, from\nwhom he was estranged. One of the church’s leaders interrogated him about his\nbisexuality, and how he could reconcile it with their faith’s teachings. Andrew\nstopped going on dates with men, because that stopped all the questions.\nExpectations continued to ramp up: volunteering to help church members with\nbabysitting once a week ballooned into a nightly commitment.\n\n“I still blame myself for falling for these tactics, because it’s not as though\nthey had a gun to my head,” he says. But, he explains, it was controlling\nbehavior, nonetheless. “They’re hugging you and joking with you one day, they\nwon’t even look at you the next, and it shapes how you think and act over time.”\n\nControlling and dogmatic groups promise a life filled with meaning, and a new\nfamily who will never leave you. In reality, they entrap people in a complex web\nof sometimes incompatible expectations, with rejection forever looming. Since\nmany of these organizations rely on their members’ devotion, free labor, and\ndonations in order to function, they have a vested interest in making people\nfeel like their efforts are never enough.\n\nAndrew says it took him a couple of years to figure out he was being played. The\nstress of being in the church began to give him panic attacks, but members saw\nit as a betrayal of their “family” for him to seek group therapy. That made him\nbegin to question their beliefs. It’s also when he sorted out that he was\nAutistic.\n\nSome of the Autistic people I spoke to had less dramatic experiences that were\nstill damaging. Things like becoming unhealthily attached to graduate student\nadvisors, or devoting years to nonprofits or activist groups whose goals they\ntruly believed in, but which had really unhealthy boundaries or a toxic,\nworkaholic culture. Other Autistic people I interviewed became adherents to\nrigid belief systems of their own making, without the influence of anyone else.\nThey wanted to make their own worlds predictable, easy to make sense of, small.\nIt began as a way to take charge of their lives, until the number of\nself-imposed rules they followed spiraled out of control.\n\nSome Autistic people end up being radicalized by far-right online communities,\nwhich tailor themselves to appeal to lonely, frustrated men.[45] Groups like\nQAnon, the Proud Boys, and Men Going Their Own Way provide a sense of belonging\nto people who have persistently been alienated. They offer friendship and a\nplace where it is safe to ask taboo questions and say offensive things without\nfear of social consequences. These communities also prey on the Autistic\ntendency to fixate on a narrow array of topics. They bombard members with\npropaganda, teach them obscure language that no one outside of the group will\nunderstand, and desensitize them to bigotry using jokes and memes. Once deeply\nembedded within these subcultures, it’s very difficult for an Autistic person to\nclaw their way out; their extreme beliefs and hyperspecific way of communicating\nmake it harder than ever to get a job or make friends.\n\nNeurodiverse women and gender nonconforming people are similarly preyed upon by\n“gender critical,” transphobic communities, which use many of the same\nthought-controlling tactics. A former member of one of these groups, the writer\nKy Schevers, says they were basically subjected to anti-trans conversion therapy\nby fellow group members.[46] They were taught to censor their own feelings of\ngender dysphoria, and to view the desire to transition as a betrayal of the\ngroup and of womanhood in general. I’ve read up on these groups extensively and\nfollowed a lot of anonymous “gender critical” accounts for years, and it’s\nshocking to me how many of its members are Autistic. This fact has even become a\npart of their ideology: they claim to be protecting Autistic women from being\nlured into the “trans cult.” In actuality, they’re the culty ones, seeking out\nvulnerable, gender-dysphoric people and working to isolate them from the broader\ntrans community.\n\nIn the list below I’ve listed a few attributes common to high-control groups,\nwhich were originally observed by psychiatrist Robert Lifton in his classic\ntext, Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism.[47] Lifton’s research\nfocused on manipulation techniques pushed on political prisoners and prisoners\nof war, but subsequent work has found similar processes being invoked by\nAmerican extremist groups,[48] as well as groups that might not qualify fully as\ncults but still exert a strong pull on their members, such as many evangelical\nfaith communities.[49] Abusive, manipulative dynamics appear on a smaller scale\nin multilevel marketing schemes,[50] exploitative workplaces, and even\ncommunities that pride themselves on being progressive bastions of free thought,\nsuch as academia.[51] It’s important for Autistic people to be aware of the\nwarning signs of psychological manipulation, because we are at an elevated risk\nof being targeted by organizations (and even informal social groups) that employ\nsuch methods.\n\n\nWARNING SIGNS OF A HIGH-CONTROL GROUP\n\n 1. The group promotes an antagonistic view of the outside world and nongroup\n    members: “It’s us versus the world.”\n\n 2. Group members constantly feel insecure about their position within the\n    group; members may be punished for any small mistake or failure.\n\n 3. Personal boundaries are discouraged; people are expected to view the group\n    as a “family,” and sacrifice as much as they can for it.\n\n 4. Any perspective that challenges the group’s orthodoxy is unspeakable;\n    members feel shame about thinking or feeling the “wrong” things.\n\n 5. Repetitive language and group jargon are used to dismiss criticism. Group\n    members repeat empty clichés in order to silence difficult conversations.\n\nMost Autistic people never become radicalized by hate groups, of course, and it\nwould be both ableist and ethically troubling to claim someone’s disability\nexcuses their adopting a racist, sexist, transphobic ideology. However, it’s\nimportant for each of us to recognize how a mix of social exclusion, Autistic\nhyperfocus and rule-abiding, and cultlike programming can blend to taint a\nvulnerable person’s thinking. When you have never been able to move through the\nworld comfortably, you’ll seek relief and meaning where you can get it. For a\nsubset of Autistic people, that means falling into abusive, cultlike\ncommunities. For others, it takes the form of rationalizing or excusing abuse in\nprivate relationships. Many of us mask through compulsive people pleasing and\ncompliance.\n\n\nFAWNING AND COMPULSIVE PEOPLE PLEASING\n\nThe Big Bang Theory is one of the most popular sitcoms in TV history, which\nmakes the show’s character Sheldon perhaps the most famous Autistic-coded\ncharacter around. He’s infamously curt and socially detached, a jerk who gets\naway with being inconsiderate because he’s such a know-it-all. Lisbeth Salander\nfrom the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series is another classic example of the\nasshole Autistic genius trope. She uses her almost robotic perceptiveness and\nrationality to upbraid and insult people, as well as solve crimes. Rick from\nRick and Morty is another standout example. He’s actively abusive to his\ngrandchildren, and a total slob who frequently destroys his adult daughter’s\nhome, but his entire family (and most of the show’s fandom) look up to him\nbecause his brilliant, no-nonsense analytical mind invented portal technology.\n\nAs real, living people, Autistics are forever running away from the “asshole\ngenius” trope. In a 2016 survey of college students’ attitudes toward Autistics,\npsychologists found that people associated the neurotype with introversion,\nsocial withdrawal, and having a “difficult” personality.[52] These stereotypes\nof Autism existed before shows like Big Bang Theory and Rick and Morty, but\nthose portrayals certainly reinforced biases that were already there. In the\naverage person’s mind, there is a singular image of how Autism presents in\nadults: a genius, almost always a man, who is blunt and direct to the point of\ncruelty.\n\nTo avoid embodying this trope, Autistic people fold ourselves into all kinds of\naccommodating shapes. We do what we can to not seem difficult, cruel, or\nself-absorbed. We internalize the message that talking about ourselves and our\ninterests bores other people, that we’re socially inept and bad at reading\nemotions, and that our sensory needs make us big babies who never stop\ncomplaining. For fear of becoming a Sherlock, we morph ourselves into Watsons:\nagreeable, docile, passive to a fault, always assuming that the larger\npersonalities around us know what’s best.\n\nMasked Autistics are frequently compulsive people pleasers. We present ourselves\nas cheery and friendly, or nonthreatening and small. Masked Autistics are also\nparticularly likely to engage in the trauma response that therapist Pete Walker\ndescribes as “fawning.”[53] Coping with stress doesn’t always come down to fight\nversus flight; fawning is a response designed to pacify anyone who poses a\nthreat. And to masked Autistics, social threat is just about everywhere.\n\n“Fawn types avoid emotional investment and potential disappointment by barely\nshowing themselves,” Walker writes, “by hiding behind their helpful personas,\nover-listening, over-eliciting or overdoing for the other.”[54]\n\nWalker notes that by never revealing their own needs or discomfort with other\npeople, fawners spare themselves the risk of rejection. But they also fail to\nconnect with people in any meaningful way. It’s a lonesome state to live in.\nIt’s also deeply draining. Many masked Autistic adults struggle to balance\nfull-time work with social lives or hobbies at all because maintaining a\nconciliatory mask for eight hours per day is just too labor intense to have\nenergy for anything else.[55] The connections we do form may never feel\nsatisfying or authentic to who we truly are, because they rely on us meeting\npeople’s needs reflexively and always telling them what we think they want to\nhear.\n\nAutistic wellness coach Samuel Dylan Finch has written a lot about why Autistic\npeople fawn, and how fawning frays our relationships. He’s also a fawner\nhimself, though it took some time to recognize this.\n\n“I am a people-pleaser,” he writes on his blog.[56] “It took me a long time to\nrealize this, though. Because I’m opinionated! And I speak my mind!”\n\nFinch writes that when he really wants to connect with another person, his\ninstinct is to censor his real self and “mirror” the other person: “The more\ninvested I was in an emotional connection, the less likely I was to criticize\nthat person, vocalize when my boundaries were crossed, express unhappiness with\ntheir behavior, or share anything that I felt might damage that relationship.”\n\nHere are some of the signs of having a “fawning” response to stress and social\nthreat, inspired closely by Finch’s work and writing.\n\n\nFAWNING AND PEOPLE-PLEASING REFLECTION TOOL[57]\n\n\nCONSIDER EACH STATEMENT AND REFLECT ON HOW TRUE EACH ONE IS FOR YOU.\n\n 1. It doesn’t feel like anyone knows the “real” me.\n\n 2. I don’t know how to say no to people.\n\n 3. I feel responsible for managing other people’s feelings and reactions, even\n    when they don’t involve me.\n\n 4. I sometimes feel like I’m betraying myself by going along with things I\n    don’t agree with.\n\n 5. I closely monitor social situations to see when conflict is brewing, and try\n    to stop it before it starts.\n\nThe impulse to fawn that Finch describes is very familiar to me. I find it easy\nto correct a coworker if they make a factual statement that’s wrong, but when I\nwas trapped in an abusive relationship with a person I deeply loved,\ncontradicting him terrified me. Just the idea of telling him that he’d treated\nme unfairly made me want to sputter and flee the room. Years later, I still have\ntrouble criticizing people, including those who make me feel safe and accepted.\nMy brain knows better, but my body expects a rage outburst all the same.\nAutistic people are at an increased risk of domestic abuse, in part because we\ntend to be a bit gullible or overly trusting, and are quick to alter ourselves\nto placate others.[58] When you’re trapped under the mask, all love feels\nconditional. It’s hard to know which needs are acceptable to voice. It’s also\neasy for us to feel responsible for serving as an intermediary or peacekeeper\nwhen any tension arises between other people, because for us, conflict can be\nvery dangerous.\n\nSome psychological research suggests that there are heavy emotional and\nrelational costs to constantly aiming to please other people and project back at\nthem the emotions and responses they wish to see. One common fawning tactic\namong Autistics is mirroring: lightly mimicking the actions and emotions of\nanother person, trying to meet the energy they are giving off so that they view\nus as normal and similar to themselves. However, paying close attention to a\nperson’s actions and feelings and then mimicking it as best you can is a very\ncognitively draining and distracting endeavor. A study by Kulesza and colleagues\n(2015) found that when experimental study participants were asked to subtly\nmimic the behavior of a conversation partner, the mimicker actually had a harder\ntime recognizing the emotions of the person they were mimicking.[59] Even though\nthe (neurotypical) participants in the study were successfully imitating the\nemotional displays of their conversation partners, they were so focused on the\nperformance that they stopped really thinking about what those emotional\ndisplays meant. This study has not been replicated in an Autistic or\nneurodiverse sample, but if mirroring other people is so mentally\nlabor-intensive that it reduces the empathy of neurotypicals, it’s likely true\nof Autistic people as well. In fact, these results suggest that all the\nattention we put toward masking our own emotions and mirroring another person’s\ncontributes to our struggles with empathy in the first place.\n\nSince Autistic people often struggle to identify our emotions as well\n(particularly in the heat of a stressful social interaction), we often have a\nhard time recognizing when someone’s actions have hurt us or made us\nuncomfortable. It takes time for me to reflect on how and why someone’s actions\nmight have hurt me. Autistic sex educator and writer Stevie Lang has observed\nthat Autistic people sometimes find it challenging to negotiate sexual consent\nas well, because we can’t always tell the difference between wanting something,\nand wanting to want it in order to make someone else happy:\n\n“Our aversion to rejection and desire to be accepted may make it difficult to\nknow when we are experiencing consent,” he writes, “and when we are trying to\nconform to social expectations to be liked or to avoid rejection.”[60]\n\nUltimately, all masking is about setting our feelings aside so we can focus on\npleasing others or conforming to social norms. This is always going to be a\nself-destructive values system to live by, regardless of the coping mechanisms\nwe use to prop it up. Whether we use alcohol, excessive exercise, overwork,\nsocial isolation, codependency, or some other self-destructive strategies to\nhelp us blend in, it’s always going to be damaging to put social approval and\n“passing” as neurotypical above our actual needs.\n\nWe don’t actually have to live this way. Autistic people can learn to listen to\nourselves again, challenge the shame society has pushed on us, and become\nradically visible and outspoken about the accommodations we require and deserve.\nIt may be challenging and daunting to detach from years of reflexive,\nself-protective masking, but a life free from its confines is possible for us.\nIn the next few chapters, we’ll review the research on how Autistic people can\naccommodate their neurotype in all facets of their lives, hear from coaches and\nspecialists who are helping fellow Autistics learn to unmask, and meet several\nmasked Autistic people who have begun to embrace who they are, and question the\nforces that taught them to hide themselves away."},{"title":"Test Section Title","content":"CHAPTER 6\n\n\nBUILDING AN AUTISTIC LIFE\n\n“Over the last year I’ve lost over 10,000 followers. And I think that’s because\nI’ve gone from being an aspirational version of myself, and now I’m just doing\nwhat I want.”\n\nMoorea Seal is a Seattle-based author and entrepreneur, and for many years she\nwas a digital curator and influencer as well. She’s best known as the author of\nthe bestselling 52 Lists journal series, which provides a year’s worth of weekly\nwriting prompts around a specific topic or theme. There’s 52 Lists for\nHappiness, 52 Lists for Bravery, and 52 Lists for Togetherness; there are 52\nLists branded planners, postcards, and to-do lists. Each book is beautifully\ndesigned, both soothing and stimulating to look at, with graphics set against\nbackdrops of earth tones and photos of plants. The prompts are broadly useful,\nbut also reflect the mental health and self-exploration journeys Moorea has been\non over the years.\n\nThe store Moorea used to own in Seattle was much the same: a carefully arranged,\ninviting space filled with stylish dresses and jewelry, bags and heels, and ball\ncacti planted in glossy white, geometric dishes. Moorea first became\ninternet-famous on Pinterest because she had such a preternatural talent for\npulling visual elements together. Her eye and taste also led to success on\nInstagram. Moorea’s digital brand became so recognizable that fans began seeking\nout her store, which she named after herself so it would have recognizable\nbranding. Over the course of a few years, Moorea became a massively successful\nauthor, small business owner, and influencer. She went to conferences and had\nbusiness meetings with large brands. She signed deals with Gap and Nordstrom,\nand was profiled by outlets like Amy Poehler’s Smart Girls. She navigated all\nthis as an undiagnosed Autistic person, wearing a mask of sleek, feminine\nbeauty. The larger her brand became, the more confining it felt.\n\n“I’ve had so much pressure to be the face, to wear certain things, to do a\nperformance of Moorea,” she tells me. “I want to be Moorea. I want to be me. I\ndon’t want to have to put this on all the time.”\n\nAt the height of her success, Moorea was in an unfulfilling marriage and\nbeginning to question her sexual orientation. The constant grind of running a\nbusiness and representing her company was wearing her down. She started having\npanic attacks. Her brain, desperate to protect her from the overload she was\nexperiencing, would shut down during meetings and high-stress situations.\n\n“I would be in meetings and I’d have, you know, business partners yelling at me\nlike, Moorea, pay attention. Do this thing, you’re late on this. I would just\nstart bawling crying, and then they would say I was being emotionally\nmanipulative. And it was just that I had no words left.”\n\nMoorea had always felt a tension between her internally “weird” self and the\nattractive, put-together woman people expected her to be. She was an outspoken\nally to LGBTQ people, but didn’t acknowledge her own queerness. Professionally,\npeople valued her mind, and the unique images she could create, but they didn’t\nwant her to push the envelope by posting about her political views. She followed\nthe rules, tried to strike the right balance between being herself and being an\ninfluencer, but it left her trapped in a horribly inauthentic, exhausting\nposition.\n\nSo, Moorea began to let things go. She closed her store and pared down her\npartnerships to just a few key collaborators. She and her husband separated, and\nshe came out as queer. She started boxing, and getting more muscular, and began\ndressing in baggy, masculine clothing more often. On Instagram her follower\ncount dropped. She started posting about Black Lives Matter, her struggles with\ndepression, and her queerness, and more followers disappeared. Many of the\nwhite, straight women who loved Moorea’s old brand were put off by the real her.\n\nThe more Moorea embraced her true self, the more she lost. But it didn’t exactly\nfeel like a loss. She had gained a greater understanding of who she really was.\nSeveral months into the pandemic, a friend of Moorea’s suggested she get\nassessed for Autism. She received a diagnosis very quickly thereafter.\n\n“I was just happy in that moment,” she tells me. “I was just, ahhh. That makes\nsense.”\n\nMoorea’s story is a bit different from what we’ve heard so far. She had begun\nunmasking herself months before figuring out where that mask had come from in\nthe first place. The dissonance in Moorea’s life was so stark she didn’t need an\nAutism diagnosis to let her know things were unsustainable and needed to change.\nBeing a queer, androgynous influencer in a hyperfeminine, conformist industry\nwas obviously untenable. As soon as she acknowledged this, and began to walk\naway from it, all Moorea’s hidden facets began to shine. And when she did\ndiscover that she was Autistic, Moorea wasn’t shocked or embarrassed. She’d\nalways had Autistic friends, as well as friends with intellectual disabilities,\nso in many ways the revelation felt like coming home. By the time Moorea came\nout as Autistic on her Instagram, anyone who was going to be alienated by her\nhad pretty much already left.\n\n“I’m gonna keep being brutally open about myself,” she says. “People are going\nto respond however they choose.”\n\nMoorea has gone through a lot of change in the past few years, and at times it’s\nleft her emotionally reeling. But she’s approached these changes with radical\nacceptance and trust in herself. She knows that being Autistic has been a\npositive force in her life, and listening to herself has allowed her to zero in\non which kinds of life are fulfilling and sustainable for her. I think that\nultimately, that’s what every masked Autistic should be shooting for. To trust\nand unconditionally accept ourselves enough that we can accept the rejections\nand losses that sometimes come by living as we really are. We can’t please\neveryone. Unmasking means we stop trying to be an appealing “brand.”\n\nMoorea had camouflaged and compensated for her Autism beautifully for many\nyears. But she learned, at a certain point, that it was better to live on her\nown terms than it was to appeal to the masses. At the time I interviewed her,\nshe was living in a guest house on her sister’s property, and working according\nto her own schedule. She found lots of time throughout the day to play with her\nsister’s toddler-aged kid, and to take restorative walks and baths. A few months\nlater, she moved into a cheap, yet comfortable micro-studio apartment, and\nstripped down to the basics even further. She still does creative, curational\nwork, but she’s learned to let a lot of things go. This life isn’t as fast-paced\nand achievement oriented as Moorea’s old life was. But it is more her.\n\nIn this chapter, we’ll take a look at a few evidence-based ways that Autistic\npeople can build our lives around our strengths, values, and needs. We’ll also\nhear from several Autistic coaches, activists, and mental health providers who\nhave devised ways of accommodating neurodiverse bodies and minds, and learn a\nbit more about people like Moorea, who have stopped defaulting to neurotypical\nscripts about what a home, career, or life “should” look like. Recall that\nmasking consists of both camouflage and compensation. It’s a complex system of\nbehaviors, performances, and even life decisions. It follows then that unmasking\nAutism goes a lot further than just lowering our inhibitions. It means\nrethinking the entire shape of our lives. When we trust ourselves and get in\ntouch with our values, everything from how we dress, to how we lay out our\nhomes, to how we conceive of time itself may change.\n\n\nDIVERGENT DESIGN\n\nMarta Rose is an educator and Autistic peer counselor, and online she writes\nregularly as @divergent_design_studios. Some of her most groundbreaking work is\naround the concept of divergent design—the idea that the physical spaces we\ninhabit as Autistic people ought to prioritize our sensory health, and work with\nthe actual patterns of our lives.\n\n“When designing an interior space,” Marta writes,[1] “design for how you\nactually live, not how you aspire to live…your space must be designed to\naccommodate the reality of your life, without shame or judgement.”\n\nBefore living by this principle (and coaching other Autistic people on it),\nMarta used to beat herself up for things like leaving her clothes in a pile on\nthe floor at the end of the day. She put a hamper near her closet to make\nstaying organized easier, but at the end of the day, she was always too\nexhausted to sort between the clothes that were clean enough to be put away and\nwhich ones needed a wash. She had a dining room table covered in junk and\nberated herself for never using it to actually have family meals. Her home\ndesign was aspirational, but not at all practical.\n\n“My new plan is to put some hooks on the wall right beside my bed, so I don’t\nhave to take even one extra step to hang up clothes that aren’t dirty yet,” she\nexplains. Dirty clothing can go in the hamper, or just be tossed on the floor\nand gathered up later. This approach keeps Marta’s room reasonably organized,\nbut she doesn’t put stress on herself for not keeping things perfectly organized\nand clean.\n\nMariah, a designer who recently discovered that she’s Autistic, says that\nredesigning her home and workspace has been a foundational part of her\nunmasking.\n\n“I am a designer by day, so I’ve learned a lot of ‘design rules,’ but I really\nbroke a lot of them when considering my desk setup,” she says. “Working from\nhome helps me be able to unmask in a lot of ways that many people don’t even\nsee. But I’m unmasking to myself, and that feels extraordinarily liberating.”\n\nMariah keeps sensory and self-care tools in a box near her desk, so she can\nreach for them and fidget whenever she needs. A massage roller sits beneath her\ndesk, so she can stim with it using her feet. She wears industrial-strength\nnoise-canceling headphones (the kind landscapers use) and keeps plastic toy\nwands filled with glitter within arm’s reach to fiddle with. Her desk layout\ndoesn’t look like what she was taught a well-designed space “should” be. Living\nby her own rules has had a massive positive effect. She’s constantly making\nadjustments, finding new ways to make herself more comfortable.\n\n“Everything feels different, it really does impact everything. Like my body was\nmasked!” she says. Now that her daily environment works with her body rather\nthan against it, she feels physically and mentally free.\n\nMarta Rose writes that divergent design should honor the unique relationships\nAutistic people have to objects. Some of us are very stressed out by visual\nclutter, because it creates sensory “noise,” and that means home décor and\nstaying organized can be very challenging for us. If anything new enters my\napartment, I notice it instantly, and it bugs the hell out of me. Sometimes I\nthrow necessary things away on impulse, because looking at them makes me so\nstressed. A university once sent me a huge recording kit in the mail, in\npreparation for a virtual event. It freaked me out so much I nearly returned the\nbox to UPS and lied that it had gotten lost in the mail. That’s how badly I\nwanted it out of my house. I have had to work around this trigger; when I helped\norganize a trans clothing swap, for example, I asked a friend to hold on to all\nthe clothing donations. I knew if I had a bunch of trash bags of clothing in my\napartment, I might throw them away impulsively one evening.\n\nExperimental research shows that many Autistic people have trouble ignoring\nvisual “noise,” to the degree it really disrupts our processing.[2] Clutter can\nerode our focus, making it hard for us to think clearly or regulate our\nemotions. A study of Autistic schoolchildren found that many had trouble paying\nattention in classrooms where the walls were covered in distracting, bright\nposters, and the shelves were stuffed with books and toys.[3] Most children’s\nspaces are very busy and bright, despite how negatively this impacts Autistic\nkids’ processing. It’s no wonder that Moorea Seal became known for her\nminimalistic, sleek aesthetic. Lots of neurodiverse people crave spare or even\nSpartan surroundings. It’s less to keep track of, less to clean every week, and\nless to pack up when it comes time to move. It’s also very on-trend:\nminimalistic design, capsule wardrobes, and throwing away items that cause\nclutter and fail to “spark joy” (à la Marie Kondo) have all become immensely\npopular in recent years because it is so visually soothing and practical.[4]\n\nThat said, not all Autistic people are well suited to minimalism. Marta Rose\nobserves that objects carry a very strong significance for Autistic people, so\ntidying our living spaces up and throwing things away can be very difficult.[5]\nMany of us identify with the items we love, and even feel a degree of empathy\nfor them, as if they were alive. Psychologists call this phenomenon object\npersonification, and Autistics exhibit it at an elevated rate compared to the\nneurotypical population.[6] We also tend to connect emotionally with animals\nmore readily than people, which can also influence how our home environments\nshould be arranged.\n\nAutistic people frequently rely on beloved objects to provide consistency,\nfamiliarity, and emotional grounding.[7] Cleaning and getting rid of unnecessary\nthings causes decision fatigue for many of us,[8] because we have to think\nreally effortfully about why we might want to hold on to something, and game out\nevery possible scenario where it might come in handy. We also have to battle\nagainst social programming in the process: do I really want to throw out my\naction figure collection, or do I just think doing so will make me seem more\nadult? Do I never wear these boots because they are loud and impractical, or\nbecause they’re buried under a pile of t-shirts and I forget they exist?\n\nTo manage these competing needs, Marta Rose has a few suggestions. First, you\ncan display one item that represents a larger collection that’s become unwieldy.\nIf you have dozens of collectible toys, for instance, you could put up a single\nshelf featuring your current favorites and store the rest away. Selecting which\ntoys to “feature” each week or month can itself be a fun way to look through\nyour whole collection and express yourself. You can also take photos of the\nobjects to catalog them and throw some actual items away. Sometimes, old junk\ncan be repurposed: old makeup and jewelry can be used to make visual art; holey\nT-shirts can be sewn together into a quilt. This often makes the pain of\nthrowing away a beloved inanimate friend a little bit less painful, because they\nget to become part of something else that you’ll use and cherish.\n\nIf you want to hold on to an entire collection but find it distracting to look\nat every day, you can hang a curtain over your shelves, or place things into\nclosed bins. Marta also recommends Autistic people consider hiring someone to\nhelp them tidy and keep their spaces clean. Hiring a house cleaner or tidier is\nreaching out for an accommodation that you need, though Marta observes many\nAutistic people (particularly women) feel shame about enlisting that help at\nfirst. Additionally, some Autistic people might feel agitated or dysregulated by\nhaving a stranger in their home rearranging or cleaning their things, or they\nmay need cleaning tasks to be done in a very particular way, and managing that\ncan be frustrating for everyone involved. For many Autistic people, affording\nregular house cleaning visits may be out of reach. Some find a workaround by\nenlisting the help of friends or romantic partners, or by trading skills on\nlocal exchange and marketplace groups. I know one Autistic person who loves\norganizing homes and finds cleaning soothing, so she actually tidies other\ndisabled people’s houses for free, or in exchange for supplies she needs or\nhome-cooked meals.\n\nAlgedra Interior Design is a Dubai-based interior design firm that has consulted\nwith Autistic people and families to develop a handful of divergent design best\npractices.[9] Their tips are pretty unsurprising, in light of all the research\nwe’ve reviewed thus far: stick to clean lines and muted colors, such as pastels\nand earth tones; avoid loud patterns, bright lights, or ornate details. If you\nself-stimulate in ways that might cause physical harm (for example, swinging\nyour arms around), avoid furniture with sharp corners. If your body craves\nmovement, you can lay down a soft mat to flop onto. Algedra also recommends\nusing insulation, rugs, and decorative soundproofing panels to dampen noise in\nan inobtrusive way.\n\nOf course, these principles do not apply to everyone. Autistic people’s needs\nand preferences are incredibly varied, as we’ve already discussed throughout\nthis book. Unmasking in one’s living environment means detaching from\nexpectations about how one “should” live, first and foremost. Some Autistics are\nsensory seekers and crave bold, bright lights, or lots of sound, and their homes\nreflect that. Honoring the need for stimulation and excitement is just as\nimportant as providing quiet and stillness, and so for some Autistic people,\nunmasking your home may mean simply giving yourself permission to keep your\nspace as cluttered as you like. Clara, the Pete Burns superfan, knows that she\nfeels best when she’s surrounded by all her favorite records, concert posters,\nmakeup, and loud accessories.\n\n“I need color and stuff, and a place to play my music as loud as I want,” she\nsays\n\nHere are some questions to get you reflecting on what you need out of your home\nand workspace, and how you might make your own environment a little more\naffirming:\n\n\nDIVERGENT DESIGN QUESTIONS\n\n * What are some textures that ground you or your senses?\n\n * Do you enjoy a minimalistic, spare space, or a cozy space filled with\n   familiar objects?\n\n * What smells do you find relaxing? What smells invigorate you?\n\n * Do you enjoy dim light, colorful lights, or bright, white lights?\n\n * What objects do you enjoy holding or having near you?\n\n * Do you need background noise in order to focus? Is there ambient noise in\n   your surroundings that you need to block out?\n\n * Do you hold on to any objects or furniture out of a sense that you “should”\n   appreciate them? If you could let go of those things, what might you want to\n   put in their place?\n\nOne of the core elements of Marta Rose’s divergent design approach is to look at\nlived experience as data. The best predictor of how you will use a space (and\nwhat you need a space to be able to do) is how you already use it. If you never\neat dinner in the dining room, maybe that space can become a game room instead.\nIf putting on a fitted sheet is so frustrating that you never make your bed, you\ncan just lay a top sheet directly onto your mattress. In fact, this is how most\nhumans have handled bed dressing throughout history![10] You don’t need to live\nlike a “presentable” adult. You can do your own thing in your own unique way—and\nthat means you can reexamine your habits, your living space, and even your\napproach to time.\n\n\nREIMAGINE SUCCESS AND TIME\n\n“I don’t understand why the workday is eight hours,” Sue tells me. “I can get\neverything done in about three.”\n\nSue is in her early fifties and works in tech. She only figured out she was\nAutistic a few years ago, when her teenaged son was assessed. Unlike many\nformerly masked Autistics I spoke to, Sue didn’t view it as a major revelation.\nIt’s just given her a new vocabulary for why she finds other people so\nconfounding.\n\n“I’ve come to understand that neurotypicals need time talking, arranging papers,\nopening and closing their email over and over and not getting much done,” she\nsays with a shrug. “I believe that some of them actually enjoy being at the\noffice all day, and they’d rather take all day to plod through something than\nhunker down and finish it.”\n\nSue has been able to shape her life around the fact she’s very efficient, and\nhas little patience for activities she perceives as a waste of time.\n\n“I get the day’s [work] tasks done with by about lunchtime usually, then I go\nrun errands and exercise. By mid-evening, I’m ready to do work again, so I knock\nout a whole bunch of emails or whatever else. My coworkers always wake up to a\nton of Slack messages from me about what needs fixing.”\n\nYears ago, Sue’s manager learned that by giving her flexibility, the\norganization gets to benefit from her natural productivity and thoroughness. As\nwe’ve repeatedly discussed in this book, research shows Autistic people pay much\ncloser attention to small details than neurotypical people do, particularly when\nthey have the cognitive energy to do so, and in the workplace that can have real\nbenefits.[11] Many tech companies actively recruit Autistic employees because we\nhave a reputation for doing thorough work.[12] This can create an exploitative\nworkplace culture, though, where our disabilities are only valued insofar as\nthey generate profit for somebody else. It’s a highly conditional form of\nacceptance, one only reserved for the apparently “high functioning” and those\nwilling to define their lives by their productivity. However, the tech sector\ndoes tend to be a place where being direct or socially awkward is a bit more\naccepted, and in Sue’s case, it’s been a good fit. She appreciates she can be\nher authentic, brusque self at work.\n\n“I don’t have a lot of patience for inefficiency or sloppiness,” she says, “or\nbeing asked to do work that is meaningless busywork. The upshot of that is that\nwhen you work with me, you know I’m raising the standard.”\n\nThe schedules and work habits of Autistic people challenge the prevailing\nneurotypical, one-size-fits-all conception of time. Like Sue, many of us are\nable to complete a great deal of work in a single hyperfocused burst, though\ntypically we’ll need much more rest and recovery in order to sustain such\nefforts. The sleep-wake cycles of Autistic adults also differ, on average, from\nthe circadian rhythms of neurotypicals,[13] and many of us experience sleep\ndisorders.[14] One reason that we may need more sleep than others is just how\ntiring it is for us to be in the world. Sensory overload, social overwhelm, and\nthe pressures of masking all significantly drain our batteries. This means many\nof us are not well suited to a nine-to-five job, and keep other hours instead.\n\nOf course, industrial-organizational research suggests that actually very few\npeople thrive in a rigidly structured eight-hour work environment, regardless of\ndisability status. Most workers are only capable of truly focusing and being\n“productive” for about four hours per day.[15] Long workdays and long commutes\nerode a person’s life satisfaction,[16] job satisfaction,[17] and their physical\nand mental health.[18] In addition, many of the features of the neurotypical\nworkplace are distracting and anxiety-provoking for allistics as well as\nAutistics. Allistics just tend to be better positioned to push through the\ndiscomfort of bright fluorescent lights or a coworker’s pungent cologne. In this\nway, to acknowledge the needs of Autistic workers is to listen to the canaries\nin the coal mine: our sensitivities and needs help lay bare just how unfair many\nwork expectations are, even for neurotypical people.\n\nMany of the Autistic people I interviewed for this book are self-employed,\nindependent contractors, or work in a field that allows for flexible scheduling.\nAutistic author and stripper Reese Piper tells me that her work schedule at the\nclub varies based on her energy levels. Some weeks, she has it in her to work\nthree ten-hour shifts; other weeks she only has the energy for one. When\nbusiness is good, Reese can earn enough money to pay her monthly bills after\njust a couple of days of dancing, and she can take days or weeks off on\nrelatively short notice. I know several other Autistic sex workers personally\nwho got into the field because of the flexibility it allowed them. Plus,\nemotional labor and masking as friendly and interested is recognized as part of\nthe work of sex work. Clients are often willing to pay a high price for an\nauthentic-feeling social and emotional experience. For Autistic people who have\nbeen obliged to mask all their lives, it can be really empowering to be paid for\nthat skill—and to be able to afford enough down time to recover from having to\ndo it.\n\nSometimes, upending neurotypical approaches to time means pouring more energy\ninto our passions, rather than less. Autistic sex educator and researcher Stevie\nLang describes how intense focus on a special interest can itself be\nrestorative:[19]\n\n“When I am actively working on something, I turn my whole attention to it,” he\nwrites. “After this kind of focus, I need rest. Resting doesn’t always look like\nrelaxing baths or naps. It might look like immersing myself in work on as\nspecial interest, or zoning out in front of a screen.”\n\nAutistic people don’t necessarily thrive in judiciously balanced days where\nrest, work, and play are parceled out in equal amounts. Some of us operate best\non boom-and-bust cycles of intense hyperfocus followed by recuperation time.\nI’ve had periods of my life where I’ve spent upwards of thirty hours per week\nwriting and blogging, in addition to my day job, and found that pace incredibly\nexciting. Other times I’ve spent every free moment deep-reading random\nsubreddits and blogs until my eyes felt like they were going to melt out of my\nskull. I loved every minute of it, and craved doing it again. When I’m swept up\nin a special interest, I feel alive. The concepts of “work-life” balance and\n“burnout” just don’t always translate to Autistic people’s schedules in the ways\nneurotypicals might expect. I’ve gotten intense burnout from periods of my life\nwhere I worked relatively little but socialized a lot, for example.\n\nEngaging our special interests is an important part of maintaining Autistic\npeople’s mental health; one study by clinical psychologist Melis Aday found that\nAutistic adults’ participation in special interests was associated with stress\nmanagement, and with having low levels of depression.[20] One interpretation of\nthis data is that when an Autistic person has the energy to enjoy their special\ninterests, doing so is a valuable anxiety-reduction technique. It’s equally\nimportant that we make time for repetitive, self-stimulatory behavior as well,\nas research has repeatedly shown that improves our mental health and coping.[21]\nNeurotypical standards don’t account for Autistic people’s need for time to\nrecharge, fidget, and hyperfocus on our favorite activities. This may mean we\ndon’t have the energy or time to keep up with other tasks at an abled person’s\npace.\n\nBecause Autistic people’s motivation level, interests, and social and sensory\nrequirements shift, Marta Rose suggests we can think of time as a spiral rather\nthan a straight line.[22] Rather than being parceled out in detached chunks with\npredetermined purposes (lunch time, work time, sleep time), we can see time as\nflowing and even folding back on itself, an overlapping series of cycles,\nperiods of dormancy intersecting with growth. She writes:\n\n“Almost all of the standard measures of time that we now take for granted—the\nway our hours and days and weeks are structured—are based on a factory model of\nwork. I call this Industrial Time…. There are other ways of thinking about time.\nSeasonal ways. Cyclical ways. Ancient ways.”\n\nThroughout much of human history, time was a relatively intuitive concept; the\nseasons and daylight cycles influenced people’s activities and their\nexpectations. This all changed with the invention of electricity, and\nindustrialized work that took place in lightbulb-lit warehouses and offices. As\ndigital work tools have expanded, the possibility of perpetual work has taken\nover our lives. There are no periods of dormancy, no dark nights, and no snow\ndays. There is no escaping work (and productivity tools and apps), even when we\nare at home.\n\nUnder a capitalist, Industrial Time framework, any project that is abandoned or\nleft unfinished is seen as a “failure”—time wasted because it didn’t result in a\nclear end product. But when we look at time as a series of cycles or spirals\nwith goals that are ever-shifting, we can recognize that the learning and\nreflection we put into an aborted project (or even into masking) often pays off,\njust not in the way we expected. Every disappointment or failure teaches us\nsomething about what we want, and what is best for us.\n\n“Reframe failure as data,” Marta writes, “and everything changes.”\n\nMarta encourages neurodiverse people to think of progress not as approaching a\nfixed point that lies ahead of us, but as movement and adaptation, slowing down\nand speeding up as our situation requires. Because Autistic minds are all about\nunderstanding details and analyzing complex systems of information, it makes\nsense to think of our lives as fractal, forever expanding to new subjects and\nnarrowing into precise focus at the same time. We’re not single-minded Marios,\nrunning across a side-scrolling level to rescue Princess Peach. We’re more like\nthe protagonist of the video game Katamari Damacy, a freaky, colorful demigod\nwho rolls an ever-growing ball of objects around, each step forward attracting\nmore random items into his ball’s expanding gravitational field until it engulfs\nthe universe. We don’t complete discrete projects. We build worlds.\n\nOn a practical level, how can an Autistic person learn to embrace spiral time?\nMarta Rose says it comes down to two points:\n\n 1. Expand the time frame you use to gauge productivity and success. Take the\n    “long view” of your life. Don’t be afraid to cycle back to old projects, or\n    let a passion go when it’s not serving you.\n\n 2. Slow down. Stillness helps neurodivergent minds process the huge quantities\n    of data we take in.\n\nIt’s very difficult for us to unhitch our self-images from neurotypical\nexpectations, slow down, and build a life that really reflects the people we\nwant to be. Almost every Autistic person I spoke to has found that in order to\nbuild a life that suits them, they’ve had to learn to let certain unfair\nexpectations go, and withdraw from activities that don’t matter to them. It’s\nscary to allow ourselves to disappoint other people, but it can be radical and\nliberating, too. Admitting what we can’t do means confronting the fact we have a\ndisability, and therefore we occupy a marginalized position in society—but it\nalso is an essential part of finally figuring out what assistance we need, and\nwhich ways of living are best for us. You have to be able to say no to certain\nunreasonable expectations in order to genuinely say “yes” to the things you care\nabout.\n\n\nDO YOUR OWN THING, YOUR OWN WAY\n\nRory is an ADHD and Autism self-advocate and researcher living in New Zealand.\nLike so many of us, they’ve developed Autism-friendly “life hacks” to make\nregular life manageable. These are compensation strategies in a sense, but their\ngoal isn’t to mask Rory’s neurodiversity, so much as to make life easier and\nmore bearable.\n\nIn the past Rory used to struggle to stay focused while doing chores. They’d get\ndistracted and wander off to do something else. Now, when it’s time to do the\ndishes, they put on a cute pink-and-cream colored apron, don some noise-blocking\nheadphones, and place mirrors in front of exit points, so that if their mind (or\nbody) wanders away from the sink, they see their reflection and remember to keep\nscrubbing.\n\n“My dishes ‘costume’ helps me stay on track,” they say. “Mirrors remind me what\nI am supposed to be doing.”[23]\n\nAutism and ADHD can make many household chores absolute hell to keep up with.\nDirty dishes are smelly and slippery; scrubbing a sticky countertop or dirty\ntoilet over and over is understimulating as well as physically unpleasant.\nShifting between cleaning tasks is laborious, since most of us would much rather\nfocus on just one thing at a time. We often have trouble dividing up complex\nactivities into small steps, or putting those steps into a logical sequence. So\na simple-sounding goal like “do the dishes” can quickly become a long list of\nexhausting steps: gather up the dirty glasses and bowls from around the house,\nsoak the filthy pots and pans, make space on the dish rack, wash and dry\neverything, put everything away, all while coping with nauseatingly gross odors\nand wet shirtsleeves that make upsetting static travel up and down our arms.\n\nMany neurodiverse people suffer from Autistic inertia.[24] The same heightened\nfocus that makes us so good at studying our special interests for hours also\nmakes it challenging for us to get off the couch and attend to the overflowing\ntrash. To an external, neurotypical observer, it doesn’t look like we’re\nstruggling. It just looks like we’re being “lazy.” Almost every neurodiverse\nperson I’ve spoken to has been deemed “lazy” numerous times by exasperated\nparents, teachers, and friends. People see us sitting frozen, incapable of\ntaking action, and assume it’s because we don’t care or lack willpower.[25] Then\nthey admonish us for being apathetic and unreliable, which leaves us feeling\neven more paralyzed by anxiety. Neurotypicals also tend to assume we know how to\ncomplete a chore or task without instructing us in exactly what it entails, not\nunderstanding that we can’t intuit our way through unstated expectations. We may\nnot recognize, for example, that a request to “clean the bathroom” includes\nscrubbing the shower, floor, sink, and mirrors, not just tidying up.\nAlternatively, we might not know what level of clean is acceptable, and get\nstuck meticulously stripping out every bit of detritus in the grout on the\nfloor. When our best guesses at what neurotypicals want from us proves\nincorrect, we get reprimanded for going too slowly, doing too sloppy a job, or\nnot taking the other person’s perspective. Many of us get trapped in a feedback\nloop of learned helplessness, confusion, shame, and frozenness as a result.\n\nRory’s “dishes costume” and mirror system is a brilliant solution to many of the\nproblems that make chores difficult for Autistic people. The apron is cute and\ninviting, lending a bit of fun to a dull activity. Putting on a task-specific\noutfit helps Rory mentally shift into “cleaning mode.” The headphones and\nmirrors help them mentally stay there. These tools allow Rory to take full\nresponsibility for getting the dishes done, without relying on a non-Autistic\nperson for guidance or prompting. (Sadly, we can’t always rely on the people\naround us to be patient or understanding.)\n\nAutistic people are constantly having to invent our own unique ways of getting\nthings done. We use extensive research, digital tools, and a variety of little\nsneaks and cheats to brute-force our way through activities that NT people don’t\neven think about. Rhi, an Autistic blogger based in the United Kingdom, explains\nthat she uses online research to plan ahead any time she visits a new place.\n\n“I need to know where the front door is. Where the parking is. Who I will have\nto interact with,” she writes.[26] With tools like Google Streetview and Yelp at\nher disposal, she says life is much easier than it used to be. Kaitlin, who is\nboth Autistic and in recovery from an eating disorder, has also used online\nresearch to psychologically prepare for meals out with friends.\n\n“I’ll look at everything on the menu online,” she says, “and figure out what I\ncan eat that is not going to make my anorexia or sensory issues freak out. I’ll\nalso practice ordering it out loud, especially if the name for the dish is in\nanother language, and I don’t know how to pronounce it.”\n\nI don’t know any neurotypical people who sit at home googling how to pronounce\nwords like bouillabaisse or injera so they don’t seem “weird” at a restaurant.\nBut for Autistics, this level of scripting and pre-planning is normal.[27] It\ngives us a comforting sense of mastery and control. However, when neurotypical\npeople figure out we’ve put this much time and thought into activities that are\n“basic” to them, they tend to find it very off-putting. So for masked Autistics,\nblending in isn’t just a matter of figuring out the right hacks. We also learn\nto hide the fact we’re relying on such hacks at all.\n\nKaitlin says that sometimes her friends “catch” her using social scripting at\nrestaurants. Because of her eating disorder history, this level of effort and\nforethought reads as suspicious:\n\n“My friend Amy figured out I was studying restaurant menus in advance, because I\nknew too much about the menu. She thought that meant I was counting calories and\nstill active in my eating disorder. You have to walk this tightrope. Know\nenough, but not too much, or people find it very awkward.”\n\nAmy couldn’t understand that Kaitlin studied the menu in order to manage and\nreduce anxiety related to her eating disorder. Instead, she assumed that her\nfriend was worrying “too much” about the menu because she was restricting her\ndiet again. For masked Autistic people, knowing “too much” or thinking about\nsomething too deeply is seen as suspect. People find it calculating or creepy\nfor us to put more effort into something they never grant a passing thought.\n\nIn all of these ways, Autistic “life hacks” and the pressures of masking are\nquite often linked. But they don’t have to be. Though neurotypical people expect\nus to hide the efforts we go to in order to fit in, not hiding our brushstrokes\ncan be a revolutionary act. If something is difficult for us, we shouldn’t have\nto pretend it’s easy, or hide our exhaustion or stress. And if we need a lot of\ninformation in order to feel comfortable navigating an unfamiliar space, we\nshouldn’t have to conceal that fact, either.\n\nThough Kaitlin is not out as Autistic to everyone, she did decide to explain her\n“guilty” menu knowledge to Amy.\n\n“When I was younger and even more insecure, it would have been an embarrassment\nto reveal oh yeah, actually I have been reading menus ahead of time. But Amy\nknows I have an Autistic brother, she knows how that affects his life. So I told\nher, look, I’m like he is, and this is what we do. It helps me to study new\nplaces and new foods.”\n\nNow that Amy understands Kaitlin’s Autistic life hacks, the two have bonded over\nit. When they go out to eat, Amy asks Kaitlin about which ingredients are in a\ndish, or where a restaurant’s bathrooms are located. Instead of needing to hide\nher prep work, Kaitlin gets to share it.\n\nMany Autistic “life hacks” involve using subtle accessibility tools that don’t\nmark us as disabled. We trade notes on which earplugs look the most subtle,\nwhich noise-canceling headphones are the most stylish, or how to use hobbies\nlike crocheting or knitting to process social anxiety and avoid eye contact in\nclassrooms. These are popular compensation methods because they work really\nwell. But we don’t always have to rely on subtle approaches that appeal to\nneurotypical sensibilities. We can proudly, visibly do our own things in our own\nways, and share the shortcuts and systems that make our lives possible. We can\nstim with big, intense gestures, wear large, obvious ear defenders, and ask for\nhelp when we need it. The more honest we are about the challenges we’re facing,\nthe harder it will be for neurotypical people to ignore our voices, or the fact\nthat most public spaces are still incredibly inaccessible. Being more radically\nvisible is also an exercise in unlearning shame.\n\n\nBE RADICALLY VISIBLE\n\nSky Cubacub is the founder of Rebirth Garments, a clothing and accessories\ncompany that centers on the needs of queer and disabled bodies. Sky’s shop\nfeatures a wide variety of colorful, comfortable items for people of all genders\nand sizes: bodysuits assembled from panels of fishnet and neon fabric,\ngender-affirming chest binders that aren’t too restrictive or tight, and a large\narray of brightly patterned T-shirts, bandanas, and pins.\n\nAt the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Rebirth Garments was one of the first\nshops to offer face masks with clear vinyl windows that make it possible to read\nthe wearer’s lips. For many disabled people (including Autistics), being able to\nread a person’s lips makes it much easier to follow a conversation. With\neveryone wearing masks, I struggled to tell when someone was speaking to me,\nbecause I relied on the visual cue of their lips moving to tune my attention\ntoward them.\n\nThe clear window masks were in such high demand Sky decided to give their design\naway for free. They’re more than a fashion visionary; they’re a political\nvisionary, too, and that’s evident in every aspect of how they run their\nbusiness. Their entire body of work is driven by their philosophy of radical\nvisibility, which they’ve discussed in workshops, a TEDx talk, and in their\nzine, Radical Visibility: A Queercrip Dress Reform Movement Manifesto.\n\nWhat is radical visibility? It’s an approach to LGBT and disabled acceptance\nthat emphasizes and celebrates that which is usually obscured. It lays claim to\nwords that have been used to dehumanize our communities—queer, cripple, mad—and\nwears them defiantly, as a source of pride. Radical visibility presents tools\nsuch as canes and prostheses as enviable fashion accessories. It renders our\ndifferences cool.\n\n“Cultural norms don’t encourage trans and disabled people to dress stylishly or\nloudly,” Sky writes.[28] “Society wants us to ‘blend in’ and not draw attention\nto ourselves. But what if we were to resist society’s desire to render us\ninvisible? What if, through a dress reform, we collectively refuse to\nassimilate?”\n\nRadical visibility, in other words, is absolutely antithetical to masking. Where\nmasking conceals, radical visibility steps into the limelight. Where masking\nscans the environment constantly for signs of social threat, and reins in the\nunruly stims and tics of the Autistic body, radical visibility encourages it to\nsimply be. A masker gets their needs met in private, through a serious of\napologetic half measures and veiled coping mechanisms; a radically visible\nperson openly declares who they are and what they require, because it’s what\nthey deserve.\n\nLong before figuring out I was Autistic, I had noticed how visibly disabled\npeople were encouraged to minimize their difference. In high school a close\nfriend was looking to buy a wheelchair with an atomic green frame. It would have\nreally suited her; she had a kind of emo-indie sense of style at the time and\nthe bright green chair would have really worked with it. But my friend’s mother\ndiscouraged her.\n\n“You don’t want your wheelchair to be the first thing people notice when they\nlook at you,” she said.\n\nHaving a black, nondescript wheelchair didn’t really change the fact that\ndisability was the first thing people saw when they looked at my friend. We were\nliving in too ableist of a world for that. In public, strangers talked down to\nher, as if she were a child, or they acted as if she couldn’t speak for herself.\nAbleism inclines us to zero in on the aspects of a person that strike us as\nunusual. The widespread social exclusion of disabled people contributes to this,\ntoo. The fewer people in wheelchairs you see, the more noteworthy a wheelchair\nseems. And the more strangers gawk and stare at wheelchair users, the less\ncomfortable a physically disabled person feels entering the world. It’s a\nself-perpetuating cycle of exclusion.\n\nHaving a bright green chair might have done more in the long term to normalize\nmy friend’s disability and make it unremarkable to people. It would have\nconveyed that wheelchairs are not something to hide, and that disability is not\nsomething to ignore or paper over with condescension or euphemism. And as the\nresearch on self-stigma that I discussed earlier suggests, wearing one’s\nidentity with pride can reduce feelings of self-consciousness and alienation.\n\nAutism isn’t always as visually obvious as using a wheelchair, but research\nshows there are many subtle markers of our difference that neurotypical people\ndo pick up on, though not always consciously. Sasson and colleagues (2017), for\nexample, found that neurotypical people quickly and subconsciously identify that\na stranger is Autistic, often within milliseconds of meeting them.[29] They\ndon’t realize that they’ve identified the person as Autistic, though; they just\nthink the person is weird. Participants in the study were less interested in\nengaging in conversation with Autistic people and liked them less than\nnon-Autistics, all based on a brief moment of social data. It’s also important\nto point out that the Autistic people in this study didn’t do anything “wrong”;\ntheir behavior was perfectly socially appropriate, as was the content of their\nspeech. Though they tried their damnedest to present as neurotypical, their\nperformance had some key tells, and was just slightly “off,” and they were\ndisliked because of it.\n\nFor all the effort that maskers put into hiding our neurodiversity, it often\nblows up in our faces. Inauthenticity and a forced-seeming social performance\nrubs neurotypicals the wrong way. In a landmark study into the psychology of\nperceived “creepiness,” psychologists McAndrew and Koehnke (2016) asked 1,341\nrespondents to answer questions about which personal qualities and behaviors\nthey associated with “creepy” people, and used statistical factor analysis to\ndevelop a measurable “creepiness” factor. The creepiness factor they developed\nincluded the following traits: a person having awkward, unpredictable behavior,\nan unnatural-looking smile, laughter that occurred at “unnatural” times,\nspeaking for too long about a single topic, and not knowing when to end a\nconversation.[30] When Autistic people attempt to socialize and bond with others\nin an affable, enthusiastic way, these are often the very traits we embody. Even\nas we try to put the neurotypical people around us at ease by smiling, keeping\nthe conversation moving, and staying present, we might be seen as scary or\nunsettling.\n\nA series of experiments by social psychologists Leander, Chartrand, and Bargh\n(2012) found that when a person engages in social mirroring in an even slightly\ninappropriate way, it skeeves people out, and even makes them feel physically\ncolder.[31] A little bit of mimicry is normal among friends. People mirror one\nanother’s postures and mannerisms as they get comfortable and fall into sync.\nBut if you mirror someone too much, or at the wrong time, these studies show you\ncan literally give other people the chills. Autistic maskers try really hard to\nmirror other people, but since we can’t do it as fluently and effortlessly as\nneurotypicals do, we often unwittingly set off NT’s creep-dars.\n\nThe solution, then, is to stop hiding and pretending to be something we’re not.\nInstead of straining (and failing) to imitate NT people, we can become radically\nvisible. Sasson’s research found that when participants were told they were\ninteracting with an Autistic person, their biases against us disappeared.\nSuddenly they liked their slightly awkward conversation partner, and expressed\ninterest in getting to know them. Having an explanation for the Autistic\nperson’s oddness helped the creeped-out feeling go away. Follow-up research by\nSasson and Morrison (2019) confirmed that when neurotypical people know that\nthey’re meeting an Autistic person, first impressions of them are far more\npositive, and after the interaction neurotypicals express more interest in\nlearning about Autism.[32] Radical visibility has its rewards.\n\nIn Sky’s work, to be radically visible is to embrace self-presentation as a form\nof protest. They write: “Radical Visibility is a call to action: to dress in\norder to not be ignored, to reject ‘passing’ and assimilation.”\n\nIn person, Sky looks exactly as eye-catching and cool as they do in their photo\nshoots: they wear a silver-and-black headpiece made of metal scale mail and\nbrightly patterned leggings and a crop top, with geometric crystal designs\npainted on their face. There’s no ignoring them, no fear of the abled gaze\ncausing them to hide how they naturally move, or what their body needs. Years\nago, following the development of a stomach disorder, Sky had to stop wearing\nfirm, structured pants (like jeans) in favor of bottoms made from stretchy\nmaterials. It’s rare to see them wearing anything other than leggings or comfy\nbike shorts. In this respect, Sky’s experiences are instructive to Autistics\nseeking to unmask. So many of us cram our bodies into uncomfortable, bland\n“professional” attire in order to blend in, though doing so can feel like the\ndeath of our individuality, or a sensory assault.\n\nFor masked Autistics who’d like to take a more radically visible approach to\npersonal style, here are some ideas to get you started:\n\n\nRADICAL AUTISM VISIBILITY:\n\n\nDRESSING TO UNMASK\n\n * Identify which items of clothing put too much pressure on your body, or apply\n   pressure in the “wrong” places. Replace too-tight pants with similar styles\n   made from stretchy fabrics, for example, or swap out structured bras for\n   bralettes. There are even neckties that come in soft, more flexible\n   materials.\n\n * Identify which types of clothing provide grounding or soothing sensory input.\n   For example, some Autistic people enjoy the feeling of compression on their\n   wrists, and tight watches or bracelets. Others enjoy heavy coats or vests.\n\n * Find and remove other sources of sensory stress in your wardrobe: try cutting\n   out all the tags in your clothing and placing inserts in uncomfortable shoes.\n   Many Autistic people walk on the balls of their feet, so you may need extra\n   support there.\n\n * Figure out which patterns and styles really feel joyful to wear. Do you feel\n   most “yourself” when you’re all in black? Or do you prefer to be a bold\n   rainbow?\n\n * Incorporate special interests into your daily attire. Wear T-shirts with your\n   favorite anime characters, or in more formal environments, get\n   video-game-themed cuff links or lapel pins. “Closet cosplay” as your favorite\n   characters in subtle ways.\n\n * Stim in style: wear jewelry you can fidget with or chew on (chewelry), keep\n   fidget toys in pockets, cover your phone case with colorful stickers or a\n   pop-up stand you can fiddle with.\n\nMany masked Autistic people are so divorced from their own bodies and\nself-presentation that it’s hard to imagine how taking real ownership of it\nmight feel. If your clothing has only ever been a neurotypical costume, you\nmight not have any idea what authentic personal style would even look like. If\nthat’s the case, start small, and focus on alleviating your discomfort. Get rid\nof the clothing items that cause you pain or distress. Swap out uncomfortable\nitems for more forgiving alternatives, and question ideas about respectability\nthat might be holding you back. You might not need to wear the makeup,\npantyhose, or rigid suit jackets a mentor or parent once taught you was\ncompulsory. Maybe you can do the “big chop” and stop chemically straightening\nyour hair,[33] or wear jewelry and textiles traditional to your home culture.\nMuch of the professional world does place tight restrictions on how a person\nought to dress and present themselves, but if you are among the majority of\nAutistics who work outside of a corporate environment, you may have more wiggle\nroom than you think.\n\nA growing number of Autistic creators are making wearable stim toys and\naccessibility tools. Carly Newman, a visual artist and jewelry designer, has\nmade a line of earplug earrings for Autistic folks.[34] Instead of trying to\nhide the fact that I sometimes need earplugs when I’m in public, these earrings\nput my accessibility tools on display. Companies like Stimtastic and ARK\nTherapeutic specialize in stim jewelry, such as spinning rings and acupressure\nbracelets. Some Autistic creators have also made buttons, hats, and jewelry that\ndo their communication for them: big badges in green that read Come Say Hi! or\nin yellow that say Give Me Space. At conventions that are well attended by\nAutistic people, these tools are invaluable, helping us socialize while also\nputting our boundaries on display. They aren’t broadly normalized yet, but just\nlike displaying one’s pronouns on a pin or in an email signature, the more\npeople adopt them, the more normalized thinking about them becomes.\n\nOf course, wearing affirming clothing and accessories is just one means of\nembracing radical visibility. At its core, both unmasking and radical visibility\nare about dropping the façade of compliant neurotypicality, and learning to live\nopenly and honestly as oneself. That is primarily a change in how we express\nourselves and our needs to other people. To that end, here are a few tips for\nhow to practice radical visibility in your daily life:\n\n\nEVERYDAY UNMASKING:\n\n\nDAILY CHALLENGES FOR BEING RADICALLY VISIBLE\n\nDisappoint someone: Practice saying “no,” “I’m not available to do that,” “I’m\nuncomfortable with that,” or “I have to go now” without any explanation or\napology.\n\nExpress disagreement in a situation where you’d normally just nod along to keep\nthe peace.\n\nNotice when you feel pressured to do something you don’t wish to do. Practice\nobserving this aloud: “I’m not sure why you are pushing this, because I already\nsaid no.”\n\nTry to go an entire day without guessing or anticipating anyone’s emotions.\n\nTry to go an entire day without controlling what messages your facial\nexpressions or body language is giving off.\n\nAsk for something you usually feel too guilty to request.\n\nGo through an entire conversation without faking any reactions or emotions.\n\nSing along to your favorite music while walking down the street.\n\nBring a stim toy with you to a social gathering or public space, and use it\nwithout shame.\n\nWear a fancy outfit or costume you absolutely love, instead of waiting for an\nevent or an “excuse” to wear it.\n\nWhen a friend asks you how you are doing, give them an honest answer.\n\nTake action without running it past anyone else for approval.\n\nShare big emotions with safe people: find someone you can cry with, or vent to a\nfriend about something that fills you with rage.\n\nTell someone you trust about your neurodiversity, and what it means to you.\n\nRadical visibility is self-advocacy, as well as self-expression. But for most\nmasked Autistic people, it’s downright terrifying to stand up for yourself. We\ntend to default to people pleasing, smiling, and laughing uncomfortably through\nsocial difficulty, and to do so in such a reflexive way that it’s as if our true\nfeelings and preferences disappear when other people are around. These reflexes\nexist to protect us, and there is no shame in having them. However, if we wish\nto live more freely, we need to cultivate relationships where we can communicate\nhonestly and feel heard and respected. The next chapter is all about\nconstructing Autistic relationships that help us to thrive. By this, I mean\nforming meaningful relationships and a sense of community with fellow Autistic\npeople, as well as making our existing relationships with allistic people far\nmore Autism-friendly."},{"title":"Test Section Title","content":"CHAPTER 7\n\n\nCULTIVATING AUTISTIC RELATIONSHIPS\n\nIt’s been years since he stopped working with Act Up and moved out of New York,\nbut James Finn remains a highly engaged LGBTQ activist. From the small village\nin Michigan where he now lives, he regularly publishes articles about the latest\nlegal and political attacks on LGBTQ rights happening throughout the world, and\nmeets regularly with activist groups. He also helps manage one of the largest\nLGBTQ groups on Facebook. Sometimes, James’s direct, very Autistic style of\ncommunicating rubs his fellow activists the wrong way. He once deeply offended a\nfellow organizer by asking her to slow down and explain her plans more clearly.\n\n“I had to actually come out and say, listen I honestly don’t understand you,”\nJames says, “I know that other people in this conversation probably do. But I’m\nAutistic and I have a lot of trouble reading between lines sometimes; can I ask\nyou to just slow down?”\n\nOn paper, James had done everything right. He’d stood up for himself, asked for\nthe relatively simple accommodation he needed, and even explained why he was\nfinding it hard to keep up. He was unmasking flawlessly. Unfortunately, it\ndidn’t go over well—at least not at first.\n\n“She said, I was gaslighting her and mansplaining,” he says with a sigh. “I just\nmade myself vulnerable and she became hostile.”\n\nAutistic people tend to love infodumping (sharing knowledge with other people as\na means of bonding), we miss social cues that seem obvious to others, and we\ntend to speak in monotonous voices that are read as dry or sarcastic. A lot of\nus find the natural flow of conversation challenging, either interrupting people\nat the “wrong” times, or failing to jump in during a fast-paced exchange and\nbeing left out entirely. For these and other reasons, Autistic women\n(particularly women of color) are often viewed as cold or “bitchy,” and Autistic\nmen are often mistaken for being condescending “mansplainers.” It’s a very\nchallenging social minefield to navigate, because of course most women have been\nmansplained to before, and have been gaslit, and are understandably on edge when\nfacing behavior that resembles it. Abled people who are oppressed along one\nidentity, such as gender, don’t always understand they might wield a certain\ndegree of power over disabled people who look very socially powerful to them.\n\nThe organizer was certain she was being mocked by James, or that he was asking\nher to re-explain her points in an attempt to derail her. No doubt men in\nactivist meetings have used such tactics against her in the past. Luckily, there\nwere other meeting attendees who were able to vouch for James’s character.\n\n“Fortunately, a couple other people in the room spoke up and said no, he’s not\njoking, he’s pretty damn Autistic,” he says.\n\nThe other organizer wasn’t willing to trust James when he spoke about his own\ndisability (it’s so rare that we are trusted and heard when we communicate our\nneeds), but she did defer to the abled people who backed James up. The tension\nin the meeting was quickly disarmed. Without that support, James’s honesty and\nself-advocacy might have been punished.\n\nJames’s behavior is a perfect model of how to stand up for yourself as an\nAutistic person, and the response of his acquaintances are also a\npicture-perfect illustration of how to be an ally to Autistic people. Despite\nall of this, the interaction was still tense. I think it’s important to show an\nexample of nearly everyone acting correctly, or at least understandably, with a\nsomewhat unsatisfying result. Unmasking isn’t a universally positive experience;\nsometimes when we put ourselves first, we will frustrate and disappoint others,\nmaybe even leave them feeling triggered or upset. It’s vital we learn to\nnavigate interactions marked by conflict, and practice standing firm in the face\nof negative reactions from others. As long as we haven’t abused anyone or\nviolated their rights, it’s okay for our actions to make others unhappy. After\nall, neurotypical people step on conversational toes and continue breezily along\nall the time. Neurodivergent folks should, at the very least, be given the\nlatitude to be flawed, fully present humans as well.\n\nIn many ways, masking is psychologically similar to codependency, a relational\npattern of seeking to manage or control the reactions and emotions of other\npeople that usually results from abuse.[1] Unmasking requires we stop relying on\nneurotypical people’s acceptance in order to guide how we should act—and that\nmeans sometimes doing the “right” thing even when we know it will rub others the\nwrong way. Most masked Autistics need a lot of practice developing a strong\nsense of discernment, which is essentially using our own beliefs and perceptions\nto guide our behavior, rather than deferring to everyone else’s fleeting\nreactions and impressions. Maskers tend to get very distressed when people are\nunhappy with us, because disapproval has been so dangerous and painful for us in\nthe past. Many of us will do nearly anything to keep other people satisfied.\nLearning to tolerate the distress of upsetting someone is crucial to developing\nreliable self-advocacy skills.\n\nMaskers are highly dependent on the opinions and feelings of other people. We\nbend over backward to make life easy for neurotypicals and the people we care\nabout, we hide facets of ourselves that are distracting, weird, or inconvenient,\nand we become hypervigilant about tracking people for signs of disapproval. It’s\nnormal and healthy to be considerate toward other people, but masked Autistics\ntend to devote so much energy to people pleasing that we have almost no\ncognitive space left to think about (or listen to) ourselves. It also impedes us\nfrom connecting with people in a genuine way. You have to really recognize a\nperson’s emotions—good and bad—and respond to them honestly in order to forge a\nbond. Surface-level smiling and mimicry makes it harder to see and appreciate\npeople in all their complexity.\n\nUnmasking in public feels nearly impossible, because when we are around people,\nit’s as if we have no thoughts or feelings of our own. I’ve been in that\nposition myself, so profoundly inhibited I had no idea what my genuine\npreferences were, unable to recognize someone had crossed a boundary or made me\nuncomfortable until hours after the fact, when I was alone and had space to\nreflect. Though I wish I could present unmasking as a singularly positive\nexperience where you unburden yourself of all anxiety and venture out into an\naccepting, enlightened world, I know for a fact this isn’t the case. Often it\nwill be nerve-racking and awkward. We have to choose to unmask because we\nrecognize masking is hurting us, and that it is worth being subjected to\nneurotypical disapproval in order to claw our way out of that trap.\n\nSometimes unmasking means getting odd looks on the bus and working like hell to\nnot let it keep you from stimming. Sometimes it means writing an email to a\nfriend, days after an argument, to explain that you’ve just realized their words\nhurt your feelings. For Black and brown Autistics, unmasking is particularly\nfraught, as being visibly disabled in public can turn deadly. For many of us it\nwill mean making hard decisions about where we feel most safe and accepted, and\nwhen and how we can unmask most effectively. There are a lot of competing forces\nat play when we bring our real selves to a social interaction, and a lot of\nrisks that exist alongside the copious opportunities and benefits.\n\nIn order for unmasking to be sustainable and healthy for us, we have to put a\nlot of new coping strategies in our arsenal and have some truly supportive loved\nones in our corner. We have to be able to manage conflict in our relationships\nand nourish the bonds we have with those who truly understand us. At times,\nunmasking means teaching our neurotypical friends and family to treat us better;\nin other situations, it may mean disengaging from those who aren’t ever going to\nbe worth the effort. This chapter is filled with exercises and research that are\nall about crafting relationships that serve your emotional and psychological\nneeds as an Autistic person—and learning how to navigate the public spaces and\nsocial interactions that aren’t as supportive and accepting as well.\n\n\nSELF-DISCLOSE—WHEN IT MAKES SENSE TO\n\nWhen James explained that he couldn’t follow what was being said because he is\nAutistic, he was self-disclosing his disabled status. Research is mixed on\nwhether Autistic self-disclosure is beneficial. As I’ve already discussed, some\nexperimental work does show that when a neurotypical person realizes they’re\nspeaking with an Autistic person, they exhibit less bias, and like the person\nmore than if they hadn’t known. Realizing that a person’s awkwardness is\nactually just neurodivergence can make it seem more explicable and less\n“creepy.” However, psychologists aren’t sure this short-term benefit (observed\nin one-on-one conversations) translates to large groups or workplaces.\n\nA recent study by Romualdez and colleagues asked Autistic adults about their\nexperiences self-disclosing in professional settings.[2] The authors found that\nwhile most Autistics “came out” with the hope of getting workplace\naccommodations and being treated more patiently, 45 percent said the decision\ndid not benefit them. Though relatively few people in this sample reported being\nmistreated after coming out as Autistic, many confessed that it didn’t change\nanything about how they were treated, and only left them feeling more\nvulnerable. On the flip side, 40.4 percent of respondents said that coming out\nwas a net positive, either because their supervisor was open to accommodating\nthem or because coworkers were understanding and appreciative.\n\nAdditional research shows that the impact of Autistic self-disclosure really\nvaries based on how knowledgeable a person is about the neurotype.[3] When\nsomeone’s knowledge of Autism is shallow and stereotypical, they tend to react\nto self-disclosure in a highly stigmatizing, dehumanizing way. They may be\nstartled to realize that Autism can even occur in adults, for example, and might\nblurt out the much-bemoaned, “but you don’t look Autistic!” Sometimes an\nAutistic self-disclosure is met with infantilization (even literally being\nspoken to in a baby voice), or with a ton of condescending reassurance about how\nsmart they are, and how good they are at seeming normal. When an Autistic person\ncomes out at school or work, they may suddenly be given a very wide berth,\nbecause people are terrified of saying the wrong thing or offending them.\nHowever, meeting an Autistic adult and having a positive interaction with them\noften opens up neurotypical people’s minds, and makes them more receptive to\nlearning about Autism.\n\nOne avenue for practicing self-disclosure without risking IRL rejection is on\nsocial media. On social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram, Autistic\nteens and adults have gone viral with videos of themselves reacting to new music\nwith their “masks” off. One such video depicting a nineteen-year-old Autistic\nwoman stimming while wearing headphones became hyperpopular in July 2020; it’s\nbeen viewed by more than 10 million people and shared far and wide.[4] Comments\non the video are almost entirely supportive and curious, and the video’s\ncreator, Jay, has followed up with numerous other short clips educating her\nfollowers about Autism acceptance. Writer and Twitter power user Nicole Cliffe\ncame out as Autistic in 2020,[5] after writing about her kids’ Autism in a\ncompassionate way for many years prior, and has frequently used her platform to\neducate her followers about masking and compensation. Her followers have been\nimmensely supportive, and many have come forward to share their own neurodiverse\nexperiences. After decades of widespread misinformation, fearmongering, and\nstereotyping, the public is finally taking an interest in how Autistic people\ndescribe our experiences, and we finally have the outlets to ensure we’re being\nheard.\n\nOf course, it’s not always a positive experience to be openly Autistic online.\nWhen a Black Autistic dancer that I know posted videos of herself stimming along\nto music on Twitter, she was met with harassment and accusations of “faking” her\ndisability for attention. I can’t even cite her tweet anymore, because the\ndeluge of harassment she received caused her to disable her account. It’s\nnoteworthy a Black woman was treated as suspicious for doing the exact same\nthing Jay, a white Autistic, received praise for: being openly, happily Autistic\nonline in hopes of educating others.\n\nThe decision of when and how to self-disclose puts Autistic people in quite a\ndouble bind. In order to be known, we have to come out, but we’re usually coming\nout in a harsh cultural landscape where it’s likely that people won’t actually\nunderstand us. By coming out, we help to counter ignorant images people have of\nour disability, but because those stereotypes are so pervasive and\nlong-standing, it’s impossible for a single counter-example to undo all the harm\nthat’s been done. Often, when a person from the majority group encounters\ninformation that runs against their stereotypes of an oppressed group, they\nrespond by either discounting the information (for example, by saying “you’re\nnot really that Autistic!”) or by subgrouping the people who deviate from\nstereotypes (for example, by telling them “you’re not like those other Autistic\npeople, the ones who are really impaired. You’re one of the smart ones!”).[6]\n\nA lot of times, to self-disclose is to subject oneself to a deluge of\ninvalidation and ignorance. The positive impact you make is not necessarily one\nyou’ll ever notice or benefit from directly. Crystal has struggled with this\nsince the day she got diagnosed. Despite the fact that her mother and\ngrandfather were the people who blocked her from being assessed as a kid, they\nreacted to her diagnosis as if it were completely baffling and shocking. They\neven said that her Autistic traits were better left ignored, that everyone\nstruggles to fit in and keep up. This is unfortunately a common experience for\nthe first person to come out as Autistic in their family. Relatives who share\nundiagnosed Autistic traits may defensively dismiss the newly identified person,\nsaying that their struggles are just a normal part of life. Of course, this\nspeaks to their own lifelong experiences of suffering in silence. Resistance and\nbitter reactions may reveal the resentment family members feel about having not\ngotten the help or recognition they deserved, either.\n\nFor Autistic self-disclosure to really have an impact on someone, you need a\nmutually respectful, trusting relationship. They need to be willing to keep\nlearning and revise their understanding of what Autism is as they go along.\nRecently, Crystal started dating Aaqib, an elementary school teacher who told\nher he knew very little about Autism in adults. At first he said all the\ntypical, oblivious things people usually say when you come out as Autistic to\nthem: Crystal was too pretty and poised to be Autistic, and Autism wasn’t a good\nenough “excuse” for her to forget dates they had planned. Crystal told Aaqib to\nstep up and educate himself—and he did. He started watching videos by Autistic\npeople, and bought some of the books Crystal recommended he read.\n\n“I found one of the books I gave him dog-eared by the toilet at his house,” she\nsays. “Like he actually read it. Which shouldn’t be a high bar, but my family\nnever read any of the things about Autism that I sent to them.”\n\nAaqib has proven himself to be worth the effort of self-disclosure and\nself-advocacy; Crystal’s family has not.\n\nI wish I could recommend that every Autistic person be loudly and visibly\ndisabled in every area of their life. But I recognize how unrealistic and\noversimplified such a statement would be. Though most of us are initially\nhesitant to self-disclose and sometimes have to overcome our anxiety and\nself-doubt, we also each know our own circumstances best. There are a lot of\ngreat reasons to self-disclose your disability to someone, and many equally\nvalid reasons to avoid doing so. Here are some reflection questions to get you\npondering how you’d like to navigate the issue:\n\n 1. Who do I want to “come out” as Autistic to?\n\n 2. Why do I want to come out? What do I hope will happen?\n\n 3. What do I wish people understood better about me?\n\n 4. How much energy am I willing to put into educating this person about what\n    Autism “really” is?\n\n 5. Do I have a specific “ask” that I’d like to make, such as a request for an\n    accommodation or different treatment?\n\n 6. Who “gets” me and can help advocate for me?\n\nAs these questions reveal, unmasking and coming out as Autistic are not one and\nthe same, and neither decision is binary, either. You can be openly Autistic\namong friends and a select few trusted family members, for example, but not at\nlarge family gatherings or at work. You can choose to pour a lot of time into\nteaching people at your church about Autism if you think it will pay off—or you\ncan just share the specific accommodations that you need, without delving into\nwhy. It’s always helpful to have a trusted advocate at your side as well.\n\nIt isn’t your responsibility to get everyone on the same page, or to subject\nyourself to judgment and stigma unnecessarily. For example, you may decide that\nit’s easier to tell HR you get migraines, and that that’s why you need a dimmer\nswitch put on the lights. If saying you’re too sick to go out is easier than\ntelling your friends you’re dealing with Autistic burnout, it’s okay to use that\nas an “excuse” to cancel plans. It’s also fine to come out slowly, first getting\nto know your unmasked self privately, then developing unmasked (or less-masked)\nrelationships with the people who feel safest to you. A secure base of\nsupportive people can help back you up when others doubt your disability, as\nJames’s activist friends did. They can step in and help you manage sensory\noverwhelm or remind you to check in with your body for signs of distress. It’s\nmuch easier to believe that you deserve accommodation when you have people\naround you who act as though that is true. Here are a couple of affirmations to\nkeep in mind when you are navigating the self-disclosure process:\n\n * Autism is not something I need to apologize for.\n\n * Other people don’t need to understand me, or understand everything about\n   Autism, in order to treat me with respect.\n\n * I am [coming out/asking for accommodations] for me, not for anyone else.\n\nIt’s vitally important that in addition to all the individual-level work we put\ninto unmasking and demanding our needs get met, that we also find and cultivate\nsupportive relationships with people who make it a lot easier to do so. That’s\nwhat the next exercise is all about—breaking down any tendency to people-please,\nand developing deeper relationships with what Samuel Dylan Finch calls your\n“strawberry people.”\n\n\nCULTIVATING UNMASKED FRIENDSHIPS—FIND YOUR “STRAWBERRY PEOPLE”\n\nIn his writing about Autistic fawning and people pleasing, Samuel Dylan Finch\ndescribes how he used to push genuine friendships away. He associated loving a\nperson with working hard to keep them happy. Conversely, if someone was\nconsistently warm and giving, Samuel didn’t trust it. He didn’t think he could\nreciprocate real affection.\n\n“I had this tendency to bail on [the] friends, partners, acquaintances, whoever,\nthat were the most generous, warm, and emotionally-available,” he writes.[7]\n“For people-pleasers, we’re so used to working endlessly hard in\nrelationships—it’s disorienting when we aren’t asked to.”\n\nSamuel felt more at home in insecure, hot-and-cold relationships. He dated\nabusive people, was exploited by professional contacts, and neglected new\nacquaintances that had the potential to become something more. After years of\nthis, he recognized he needed to rewire his brain’s social pathways. What felt\nfamiliar clearly was not good for him. So he sat down and made a list of the\npeople who deserved his friendship.\n\n“I made a Google doc of people who were ‘too nice’ to me,” he writes. “In my\nphone contacts, I put emojis by their names. I put strawberries next to people\nwho were super loving. I put seedling emojis by folks who taught me things that\nmade me think or grow.”\n\nSamuel reached out to his “strawberry people” and told them that he wanted to\nprioritize his friendship with them. He admitted he’d discouraged their\naffection in the past because he’d been afraid of disappointing them. And from\nthen on, whenever he got a notification on his phone and saw a strawberry or\nseedling symbol, he made sure to answer quickly, and enthusiastically. He didn’t\ncancel plans with these friends anymore or create artificial distance. He\ncentered them in his life.\n\nBy and large, Autistic people don’t operate by social intuition the way\nneurotypicals do. Every notification we receive tends to be given equal weight,\nno matter how well we know a person or how we feel about them. This is\nparticularly true for maskers, who can be so terrified of upsetting anyone that\nthey seek to be equally friendly and responsive to everyone. It can be useful to\noutsource the social instincts that might come naturally to the average allistic\nperson by labeling certain individuals as high priority, or turning off all\nnotifications except for those from a specific group chat or app. Instead of\nhaving to make manual decisions about whom to respond to and in which order, the\n“strawberry people” system reinforces the idea that certain relationships are\nmore important than others, because they help you cultivate a more solid sense\nof self.\n\nWithin a year of his making these changes in his life, many of Samuel’s\n“strawberry people” had become members of his found family. They had his back as\nhe worked through therapy for PTSD and eating disorder recovery. The strawberry\npeople even became friends with one another—Samuel writes that they all talk in\na single group chat.\n\nDevelopmental psychology research has observed that Autistic people often have\ninsecure attachments to other people, beginning from a very young age.[8] A\nperson’s attachment patterns are shaped by their early relationships,\nparticularly the stability of their bond with their primary caregiver. The\nquality of a person’s early attachments also tend to predict the quality of\ntheir later relationships, both romantic and otherwise, and their ability to\naccept comfort and emotional support from other people.\n\nAs developmental psychologists define it, a child with secure attachment uses\ntheir caregiver as a grounding, supportive “base” from which to explore the\nworld. A securely attached toddler may venture around an unfamiliar playground a\nbit, fiddling with the playground equipment or trying to make new friends, for\nexample, but they will return to their attachment figure periodically to check\nin and feel safe. When left alone, a securely attached child will experience\nsadness or distress, but they are quick to relax and feel soothed once their\ncaregiver returns. As they grow up, securely attached children become adults who\ncan bond with other people with relative ease, and who can handle conflicts and\nchallenges in their relationship with a high degree of stability and trust.\n\nThere are several attachment patterns that developmental psychologists consider\nto be dysfunctional. For example, an anxiously attached child might be afraid to\nwander away from a caregiver for fear of being abandoned, and when left alone\nmay experience extreme distress that they don’t easily recover from. In\ncontrast, an avoidantly attached child may fail to engage much with their\ncaregivers. Autistics have been observed to exhibit what’s called an\nanxious-ambivalent attachment style at rates that are elevated compared to the\nneurotypical population. People with an anxious-ambivalent attachment are\ndifficult to soothe and reassure, and don’t see close loved ones as a safe,\n“secure base” they can find comfort in when lost or threatened. As adults,\npeople who are anxious-ambivalent tend to get into patterns of intense emotional\ndependency, combined with insecurity. They yearn to be accepted yet doubt that\nthey can be. When other people try to connect with us, we rebuff them without\neven realizing it.\n\nIt bears mentioning here that developmental psychologists define what a secure\nattachment “looks like” based on how it presents in neurotypical children and\nadults. Neurotypical children who are securely attached check in with their\nparents in a very easy to recognize way, using eye contact and vocalizations\nthat many Autistic children might find unnatural. Furthermore, many of the signs\nof having an insecure attachment style are difficult to distinguish from\nneurodivergence (and from being traumatized after living in a neurotypical\nworld). Avoidant attachment, for example, is marked by a child turning their\nback to their caregiver and failing to seek them out for comfort when\ndistressed. While these behaviors can indicate a child doesn’t feel supported by\ntheir caregiver, it can also be a sign they’re Autistic and averse to touch, eye\ncontact, or verbal communication.\n\nFrom an early age, many Autistic people experience rejection and lack of\nunderstanding from our primary caregivers. We also may be punished or neglected\nbecause we have failed to seek out comfort in neurotypical-approved ways. Our\nattempts at connection, such as playing next to another person but not making\neye contact with them (sometimes called parallel play), may be mistaken as a\nlack of social interest. An intense Autistic meltdown may be mistaken for us\nbeing incapable of being soothed, and taken as a sign of an anxious attachment\npattern. For these and a variety of other reasons, many Autistic people do wind\nup feeling very insecure in our attachments to other people, or having our\nheartfelt attempts at connection rebuffed or misconstrued. Neurotypical\nattachment “rules” essentially make it impossible for us to be viewed as\nsuitable for regular, healthy bonds.\n\nOne way that an insecure attachment style sometimes manifests in Autistic adults\nis feeling discomfort when receiving praise or attention. You may not even\nrecognize the positive attention you’re getting is socially appropriate, because\nyou’re so used to being mocked or picked apart, or else being swallowed up in\nintense or abusive relationships. It can be beneficial to get an outsider’s\nperspective to see if someone really is being “too nice” to you, as Samuel put\nit, or if you’re just so accustomed to mistreatment that niceness strikes you as\nsuspect.\n\nHere are some questions to help you reflect on whether you push secure\nattachments away.\n\n\nARE YOU PUSHING YOUR “STRAWBERRY PEOPLE” AWAY?\n\n 1. When someone gives you a compliment, do you feel like you have to downplay\n    it?\n\n 2. Are there people in your life who seem “too nice”? Who are they?\n\n 3. Are you afraid of trusting people because they might abandon you?\n\n 4. When someone gives you positive attention, do you feel creeped out?\n\n 5. Are you afraid that kind, loving people deserve “better” than to be friends\n    with you?\n\n 6. When someone gets vulnerable with you, do you find ways to downplay it?\n\n 7. Do you have a hard time showing people that you like them?\n\nThese questions get to the heart of the protectiveness and self-doubt that lead\nmany Autistic people to keep our emotional distance from others. Most of us have\na slew of good reasons for fearing people. When I was younger, many of the\npeople who took an interest in me were women who wanted to help “teach” me how\nto be better at womanhood. Sometimes classmates and coworkers would cozy up to\nme because they wanted my help with their classwork or writing. I started\nassuming that if someone took an interest in me, it was because they wanted to\nfix me for their own amusement, or because they thought I was useful. I figured\nevery compliment I received was me being “negged”—a tactic where people\nhighlight your difference or offer a backhanded compliment in order to make you\nfeel insecure.\n\nIt’s challenging for Autistic people to tell the difference between friends who\ngenuinely like us, and superficial acquaintances who are responding favorably to\nour masks. One way to probe the difference, though, is to look at people who\nhave stuck around when you haven’t been perfect. You won’t ever be able to relax\naround someone if their approval is conditional. Here are some questions I use\nto help distinguish between the people who are worthy of Samuel’s strawberry\nemoji, and those who are only interested in the agreeable, “fawner” me.\n\n 1. Who do I feel comfortable expressing disagreement to?\n\n 2. Who helps me think about my opinions and choices in a nonjudgmental way?\n\n 3. Who tells me honestly when I’ve hurt them, and gives me a real opportunity\n    to do better?\n\n 4. Who treats me with respect no matter what?\n\n 5. Who leaves me feeling rejuvenated or inspired?\n\n 6. Who brings out the wild, playful side of me?\n\n 7. Is there anyone I want to try being more open and unfiltered with?\n\nWhen I think carefully about these questions, a handful of very thoughtful,\nreliable, nonjudgmental friends come to mind. Their affection is consistent, and\nit shows in small gestures, like remembering the details of stories I’ve shared.\nWhen we disagree, these friends try to understand my perspective, or reflect\nthoughtfully on why I might see things as I do. If I say something flippant and\nhurtful, they tell me for the sake of our friendship, but they don’t relish me\nfeeling ashamed. They share what they want from me, ask for help when they need\nit, and don’t hold it against me when I fumble in my attempts to be there for\nthem. These friends are also typically the people I can share messy emotions or\nhalf-formed opinions with, and who I feel comfortable being weird, petty, or\nsilly around. Their support provides me a safe place to land when I’m angry,\nsad, or obsessing over some random thing a coworker said that I can’t yet make\nsense of.\n\nOn the flip side, I’ve found that I can identify who is not destined to become a\n“strawberry person” for me by pondering these questions:\n\n 1. Who do I force myself to spend time with, out of a sense of obligation or\n    guilt?\n\n 2. Who do I feel I have to earn the approval of?\n\n 3. Who makes me feel insecure and not good enough?\n\n 4. Who do I find exhausting to be around?\n\n 5. Who do I edit or censor myself around?\n\nOften, the people who fall into this category are outgoing and do give me a lot\nof attention, but only in a surface-level way. They may show an interest in me,\nbut their questions feel pointed, or like a test. Being around them doesn’t help\nme relax and unmask; it puts me on edge. Some of them are people whom I really\nfind funny or interesting, but whom I’ve witnessed ostracize or punish others\nfor making a single social error or single choice they disagreed with. One\nperson who came to mind was an incredibly charming friend whom I’ve noticed only\never tells me in a vague way that I’ve disappointed them, but refuses to\nactually explain what I’ve done, or why. Another friend who came to mind is an\nolder writer I used to look up to, but who persistently lectured me about how I\nwas too cold, too intellectual, and too “arrogant” every single time we hung\nout. Even if some of her observations are right, I have never felt accepted or\neven liked in her presence. She’s not genuinely invested in my growth; she\nmostly seems to want to knock me down a peg.\n\nThe more time you spend with your “strawberry people,” the more socially fluent\nyou’ll feel, and the less you’ll associate human contact with having to put on a\nstressful, phony performance. Quality time with nonthreatening people can also\nhelp you develop social skills that carry over into other relationships, too.\nNeuroscientists have observed that Autistic brains continue to develop in areas\nassociated with social skills for far longer than neurotypical brains are\nbelieved to.[9] One study, conducted by Bastiaansen and colleagues (2011),\nobserved that though young Autistic people experienced far less activity than\nallistics in the inferior frontal gyrus (an area of the frontal lobe involved in\ninterpreting facial expressions), by age thirty no differences between\nnon-Autistics and Autistic people were evident. In other words, Autistic brains\neventually “caught up” to neurotypical brains, in terms of how actively they\nprocessed and interpreted facial expressions as social data. Other studies have\nfound that Autistic people over the age of fifty are comparable to allistic\npeople, in terms of their ability to make sense of the motivations and emotions\nof others.[10]\n\nResearchers aren’t sure why these findings occur, only that they help to justify\nconceiving of Autism as a developmental disability or delay. For my part, I\nsuspect that Autistic people get better at reading faces and understanding human\nbehavior over time because we eventually develop our own systems and tricks for\nmaking sense of the world. We might have developed at the same pace as\nneurotypicals if we’d been given accessible tools earlier on. The social scripts\nand shortcuts that work for neurotypical people do not work for us, so we have\nto teach ourselves to develop social instincts.\n\nAutistic people can get better at reading people’s facial expressions as we age,\nand with the more social contact we have. But we also deserve to live in a world\nwhere neurotypicals try just as hard to understand us. When we spend time with\npeople who do not terrify us or make us feel socially threatened, we may be get\nmore comfortable with eye contact, initiating conversations, and being\nassertive.[11] As an Autistic person, you may never escape social anxiety\nentirely, and you might always be a bit reactive to the threat of abandonment.\nYou also don’t have to learn to express yourself or connect with others in a\nneurotypical-approved way. If eye contact is painful and overwhelming for you,\nunmasking by refusing to perform eye contact is more important than getting\ncomfortable with it. By engaging with healthy, supportive people, you can learn\nto open up and express yourself effectively—in a way that works for you. As you\nget more comfortable in your own skin, you may find that people are less\nthreatening and confusing as an added benefit.\n\n\nCOMMUNICATE CLEARLY AND HONESTLY\n\nAutistic people usually prefer explicit, clear messages that don’t rely on tone\nor nonverbal cues. We like having specific expectations laid out for us, and\nbeing given many opportunities to ask questions and clarify meaning. When we\nshare these needs with the allistic people around us, our relationships can open\nup, allowing for much greater depth and breadth of connection. When we accept\nthe unique features and strengths of our communication style, we can also feel a\nlot less socially inept and disempowered.\n\nHere’s a table summarizing some common Autistic communication needs. You can\nshare this table with neurotypical people in your life or organizations that are\naiming to be more accessible, or simply request some of these specific\nadjustments for yourself.\n\n\nCOMMON AUTISTIC COMMUNICATION NEEDS\n\n\nOVERALL NEED\n\n\nSOME ACCOMMODATIONS YOU MIGHT REQUEST\n\nClear Expectations\n\n• Specific plans with details about time, place, and what is likely to happen\n\n• A clear “yes” or “no,” no euphemisms like “I’ll think about it”\n\n• Meeting agendas that are handed out in advance, and then adhered to\n\n• Reading materials, questions, and discussion topics being provided in advance\nof a panel, interview, or other high-stress public event\n\n• Step-by-step, detailed instructions on how to complete a task\n\n• Specific, measurable outcomes or goals.\n\nExplicit Messaging\n\n• Not assuming people can use facial expression, tone of voice, posture,\nbreathing, or tears as indicators of emotion\n\n• Giving direct explanations of feelings: “I am disappointed right now because…”\n\n• Recognition and respect of boundaries: “It doesn’t sound like Sherry wants to\ntalk about that right now.”\n\n• Not punishing or judging people for failing to read between the lines.\n\n• Using clarifying questions: “What would you like me to do about this?”\n\nReduced Sensory/Social Load\n\n• Having no expectation of eye contact during intense conversations\n\n• Giving space to talk about challenging topics while driving, taking a walk, or\ndoing something with one’s hands\n\n• Allowing people to express emotions and opinions via text, email, or\nhandwritten note\n\n• Giving people time alone to reflect on their feelings and beliefs\n\n• Learning to recognize fawning, and signs of an upcoming meltdown\n\n• Providing frequent breaks from socializing, or quiet spaces people can retreat\nto\n\nTo download this chart, go to http://prhlink.com/9780593235249a002.\n\nJust as we crave direct communication, we’re equally good at dishing it\nout—sometimes too good, in fact. Throughout our lives, masked Autistics are\npunished for requesting clarity, being blunt, or saying directly the things\nothers would rather imply. Over time we learn to filter our self-expression.\nHowever, as adults with more life experience and self-advocacy skills under our\nbelts, we can begin to examine our communication style, and turn our\nconversational quirks into advantages.\n\nMore times than I can count, I’ve spoken up during a work meeting to ask what\nthe actual point of the meeting is. In both academia and political organizing,\nit’s quite common for people to call a meeting when they have a loose sense that\nsomething needs to be done, but aren’t sure exactly what that something is yet,\nor how to accomplish it. My overly analytic Autistic brain yearns for structure,\nand my social anxiety and sensory issues mean I want most meetings to end as\nquickly as humanly possible. So, when the conversation seems to have lost the\nplot and people are talking in circles, I tend to jump into an unofficial\nfacilitator role. If someone dances around expressing reservations, I try to\nunderstand their perspective and voice my own concerns explicitly. If someone\nbehaves inappropriately or is offensive without realizing it, I redirect when I\ncan. Many Autistic people can skillfully put their “little professor” and\nmasking instincts to good use in situations like these, taking the tools they\nonce used to placate and deescalate and putting them toward more prosocial ends.\n\nLast winter, I was attending a Diversity & Inclusion committee meeting at my\nuniversity. As a quick getting-to-know-you icebreaker, the meeting organizer\nasked us to introduce ourselves, and then share the thing we missed most about\nour pre-pandemic lives.\n\nThis is a very insensitive icebreaker question. At that point in time, many of\nus had been isolated for nearly a year, and were desperately craving social\ncontact, physical touch, and events to look forward to. It was a miserably\nbleak, lonesome winter, capping off an absolutely horrific year filled with\ndeath. I’m sure that several people in the meeting had lost loved ones to COVID.\nOf course, during a work meeting you can’t say that the thing you miss most\nabout life pre-COVID is a beloved relative who died. You have to pick a\nsanitized, work-appropriate answer instead, like saying you miss eating at your\nfavorite Peruvian restaurant. The dissonance made me feel ill. So when it came\ntime to introduce myself to the group, I said this:\n\n“Hi, everyone, I’m Devon, and I think I’ll pass on that icebreaker. If I get to\ntalking about everything I miss from life before COVID, I’ll start to cry!”\n\nPeople laughed sympathetically at my remark, which I made sure to deliver in a\nlighthearted tone. I didn’t want the meeting facilitator to feel criticized, but\nI felt it was important I highlight how uncomfortable his question had been.\nMasking and honesty weren’t opposing forces in that moment—one helped facilitate\nthe other.\n\nAfter I spoke up, other meeting participants opted not to answer the icebreaker\nas well. One person privately messaged me, thanking me for saying what I did.\nLater in that same meeting, I shared my dismay that the committee wasn’t\nconsidering a proposal, raised by many of Loyola’s Black students, to have\npolice taken off campus. I admitted I found much of the Diversity & Inclusion\ncommittee’s goals (which involved things like counting the number of scholars of\ncolor listed on various course syllabi) somewhat insufficient, and thought we\nneeded to do more to address police violence on our campus. As an Autistic,\nmale-aligned white person who is valued for my directness, I knew I could get\naway with raising concerns others might not.\n\nThe first few times I asserted myself like this, I worried I’d come across as\nsuper rude. Instead, I’ve almost always been thanked. I have learned that many\nallistic people find clear communication to be a welcome relief. In the\nworkplace, carefully dispensed Autistic candor can come in handy. Phrases like\n“No, I don’t have time for that,” “I’m uncomfortable with this,” and “What’s\nyour budget?” cut through elaborate social performances and render vague matters\nfar more concrete. I’m capable of being too blunt or saying the wrong thing at\nthe absolute worst time, but for the most part I’ve figured out how to put my\nAutistic candor to work for me, after years of trying to hide it.\n\nThough Autistic people have a reputation for being “bad” at communicating, the\ndata shows that really isn’t the case. A study by Crompton et al. published in\n2019 found that when two Autistic people were paired together to work on a task,\nthey were very efficient social communicators. They spread a lot of knowledge\nand nuance in a short span of time, completed the task quickly, and connected to\none another easily.[12] However, when paired with non-Autistic conversation\npartners, Autistics were frequently misunderstood and not listened to. This\nstudy suggests that much of what researchers consider the “social deficits” of\nAutism aren’t really deficits at all; they’re just differences in our\ncommunication style that neurotypicals don’t adjust to.\n\nWhen neurodiverse people push for more explicit messaging, everybody benefits.\nVague, symbolic communication is harder to parse if you’re Deaf or hard of\nhearing, an immigrant from a different culture with different idioms, a\nnonnative English speaker, or a person with social anxiety. The more elaborate\nand symbolic a culture is, the more difficult people from outside the culture\nwill find it to navigate. In some instances, this is done as a deliberate method\nof gatekeeping and exclusion. Academics are trained, for example, to write in a\nvery dry, passive, and jargon-filled way, as a sign of our intellect and\nseriousness. Because it is hard to understand academic writing and it’s only\nreally taught within the academy, being able to follow it becomes a sign you\n“belong.” But hard-to-understand writing is, by definition, less effective\nwriting. Similarly, the business world relies on hyperspecific jargon and a\nvariety of sports metaphors, which can leave those unfamiliar with its macho\nculture and communication style quite excluded. Tearing down barriers like these\nis essential to building a diverse, fluid community that is capable of evolution\nand growth.\n\nI used to believe I was horribly inept for not being able to read between the\nlines of neurotypical speech. Now I realize most neurotypicals aren’t all that\ngood at it, either. Non-Autistic people process complex situations intuitively\nand efficiently, but make a lot of errors. Just think of how many times you’ve\nseen a really confident, outgoing person misread a situation, interrupt another\nperson, or say something offensive without seeming to realize it, or to care.\nThere are negative consequences to such actions, but usually the allistic person\nwho made the error doesn’t have to bear the brunt of them. It’s everyone around\nthem who has to scramble to pick up the pieces, clarify the misunderstanding, or\nsmooth over hurt feelings. One of the most liberating realizations I’ve made as\nan out Autistic person is that it’s not harmful for me to ask questions,\ninterject when needed, or be honest about how I feel. When you tell people what\nyou want and need, you actually stand a chance of getting it. You also free up\nother people to express their needs more openly, too.\n\n\nLETTING GO OF NEUROTYPICAL EXPECTATIONS\n\n“Going into a new roommate situation I’ll tell the person, I cannot always do\nthe dishes,” Reese says. “Like they’re not going to be done, and you cannot\nexpect that from me. If this is a problem, we cannot live together.”\n\nBefore finding out she was Autistic in her mid-twenties, Autistic writer and\nstripper Reese Piper had a very difficult time holding her life together. She\nwas extroverted and sociable, and had gotten good grades in school, but she\ncouldn’t seem to keep herself or her space clean or arrive places on time. Her\nclothing was often stained, and she got food on her face when she ate. She\nforgot to answer people’s texts and could only maintain a couple of close\nfriendships at a time. Finding out she was Autistic didn’t fundamentally change\nany of that—but it did provide Reese with a context for why life had been so\nhard.\n\nShe says, “I have a disability and I’ve had a disability my whole life. Because\nit is a disability, I am entitled to some support, and admitting that is good.”\n\nPrior to accepting herself as Autistic, Reese tried to hide all the visible\n“tells” of her disabled status. At the strip club where she worked, she could\ncome across as personable and glamorous, and charm clients into buying a lot of\ndances. She was good at learning the social scripts. But she kept potential\nfriends and romantic partners at a distance. She didn’t want them to see that\nher car was filled with trash, or that dishes were piling up in her sink.\nKeeping the world at bay was the most exhausting part of masking for her.\nLooking like a functional “adult” required a ton of concealment and panicked\napologies. The most crucial part of her unmasking process has been openly\nadmitting what she is and isn’t capable of, and letting people deal with it.\n\n“I would be really embarrassed to bring someone into my car right now, because\nit is like a dumpster,” she says, “but if someone needs a ride, I’d say fuck it,\nlet them deal with it, it’s not the end of the world. It’s only mess.”\n\nFor many Autistic people, including Reese, self-acceptance looks less like\nflawless and serene self-love and more like a “fuck it, let them deal with it”\nattitude that helps her shake off the desire to hide. She’s willing to be honest\nabout who she is—even if it scares off potential roommates who would have been a\nbad fit. Slowly, she’s come to let go of neurotypical benchmarks for measuring\nher life.\n\nSometimes Autistic people believe that the end goal of unmasking is to overcome\nall internalized stigma and live completely free of shame. I don’t think that’s\na realistic standard to hold ourselves to. Ableism is a pervasive social force,\nand one we can’t entirely escape; what we can do, however, is learn to observe\nit as a cultural values system that exists outside of us, and that often runs\ncounter to our personal values. The voice in my head that tells me it’s pathetic\nthat I don’t cook is not my voice; it’s society programming, speaking from\nwithin me, and I don’t have to listen to it. Instead, I can call forth the side\nof myself that loves reading, writing, dance parties, and video games, and\nacknowledge that if eating a lot of snacks and fast food gives me more time to\nhonor that person, it’s a worthwhile trade. I can also take time to remind\nmyself that I live in a world that exalts hyperindependence to a ridiculous,\nisolating degree. Throughout history and across many different cultures, most\nindividuals did not cook for themselves.[13] Food was prepared communally, or by\nspecialized workers, because it was a labor-intensive, time-intensive task. Fast\nfood and street carts have existed since ancient times! Traditionally, most\nprivate residences did not even have dedicated kitchens, because people were\nless isolated and the responsibility of food prep was spread across the\ncommunity. It’s perfectly okay that I need help staying fed. If I were living in\na time and place where individuals weren’t held responsible for all their own\nfood prep, my struggles with such things wouldn’t be disabling at all.\n\nBecause we do live in such an individualistic world, many Autistic people have\nlearned to make trade-offs and become comfortable with needing help. Most of us\n(neurotypical and neurodiverse alike) simply were not built to do everything on\nour own, and in order to lead fulfilling lives, we either need to enlist the\nhelp we need, or let some obligations go. This is highlighted in Autistic coach\nHeather Morgan’s work: she challenges her clients (and herself) to compare and\ncontrast their personal values with how they actually spend their day-to-day\nlives.\n\n“I’m a married mom with two kids, and between the four of us there are a\nbucketload of disabilities and exceptionalities that both limit my energy and\nincrease my workload,” Heather writes on her blog.[14] “I face a litany of\ncompeting voices and priorities all scrambling for my time and attention.”\n\nHeather Morgan teaches, writes, coaches clients, and is completing a graduate\ndegree in theology. She’s incredibly busy, and because of her physical\ndisabilities she has to get a lot done while resting in bed. There simply isn’t\nenough time or energy available to attend to everything. But Heather has a\nfinely honed sense of who she is and what matters most in her life, and that\nguides which tasks she prioritizes, what she says “yes” to, and what she lets\ndrop.\n\nHeather has taken herself through the Values-Based Integration exercise that she\nuses with clients, recalling core moments in her past that made her feel the\nmost alive. She’s really drilled down into those key memories to figure out what\nmade them so powerful, and articulated the three values that unite them:\nhonesty, connection, and transformation. Those are the three qualities she\nprioritizes most above all else. And she makes it a regular practice to contrast\nthose values with the rhythms of her regular life. For Heather, examining\nwhether her life currently lines up with her values comes down to asking four\nquestions, which I’ve adapted and built out into a reflection exercise below. To\ncomplete this exercise, you’ll want to have your own list of values from the\nprevious Values-Based Integration exercises handy.\n\n\nVALUES-BASED INTEGRATION[15]\n\n\nIS YOUR CURRENT LIFE GUIDED BY YOUR VALUES?\n\n1. What am I doing right now?\n\nConsider: How are you spending your time every day? Try to keep a detailed\nrecord of how you spend your days for at least a week.\n\n2. What matches my values and what brings me joy?\n\nReflect: After you’ve kept a detailed journal of your activities for a week,\nlook back and make a note of which activities line up with your values and which\ndo not. You can assign each of your values a color, and use highlighters in\nthose colors to mark which activities are values-consistent.\n\n3. What are the reoccurring themes?\n\nNotice: Are there patterns in which activities feel the best to complete, or\nthings you consistently look forward to? What unites the activities that are\nvalues-consistent and the ones that are not?\n\n4. Let go of what isn’t yours.\n\nGet help: As Heather puts it, “What are you doing that could be done by someone\nelse? What are you doing that doesn’t need to be done as regularly as you’re\ndoing it—if at all?”\n\nExercises like these can really highlight the ways in which we’re “throwing”\ntime away meeting the expectations of neurotypical people in our lives, or just\ntrying to conform to a vague idea of what we think society wants from us. As\nsoon as we’re able to create a little distance between these implicit demands\nand our actual selves, saying “no” gets a lot easier.\n\nOn her blog, Heather tells the story of one client who completed this exercise\nand realized he was spending two hours per night vacuuming the house and\ncleaning the stove not because he enjoyed it (or appreciated the outcome), but\nbecause his mother had raised him to do so. He stopped doing it shortly\nthereafter.\n\nMy friend Cody is an Autistic person with a trauma history, and a big\nbreakthrough for him involved realizing he’ll never be able to get exercise the\nway society says an able-bodied person “should.” Anything that elevates Cody’s\nheart rate reminds him too much of his abuse. In his childhood, breathing\nheavily only meant one thing: that he was trying to escape a dangerous\nsituation. His body is a finely tuned instrument of self-protection, but it\nisn’t well suited to any grueling physical activities. So he’s decided to make\npeace with that fact, and only pursue physical activities that feel good, like\ngentle warm-ups, treading water, or getting a massage.\n\nI know countless Autistic adults who have decided that in order to lead healthy\nlives, they’ve got to let certain things go. Many of us (including me) give up\non cooking, for example, because it is such a time- and planning-intensive task.\nTiming out one’s cooking and grocery-shopping schedules, prepping ingredients,\nremembering which ingredients you have, getting rid of leftovers in time,\nknowing days in advance which flavors and textures you’ll be able to tolerate—it\ncan be so much more effort than it’s worth. Instead we let go of the burden\nentirely, and rely on ready-made snacks and fast food. Or enlist the help of a\nloved one to do all the meal planning and shopping. Staying fed and having time\nfor what matters most to us in life is enough.\n\nFor many masked Autistics, learning in adulthood that you have been secretly\nnursing a disability all your life is quite the world-shattering experience.\nAdjusting your self-concept is a long process. It can involve mourning, rage,\nembarrassment, and dozens upon dozens of “wait, that was an Autism thing?”\nrevelations. Though many of us come to see Autistic identity as a net positive\nin our lives, accepting our limitations is an equally important part of the\njourney. The clearer we are with ourselves about where we excel and where we\nneed help, the more likely we are to eke out an existence that’s richly\ninterdependent, sustainable, and meaningful.\n\nA final (and I believe crucial) piece of this puzzle is resetting your\nexpectations about what a normal or healthy Autistic life looks like. The best\nway to normalize your neurotype is surrounding yourself with other Autistic and\ndisabled people, taking in the rich diversity of our community and learning to\nappreciate the many unique ways that we live.\n\n\nFINDING (AND MAKING) YOUR COMMUNITY\n\n“What most normal, kind of vanilla people don’t understand,” Tisa says, “is that\nthe kink world is just full of Autistic nerds. People think it’s this scary,\nintense weird thing and it’s like…just a bunch of nerds learning about different\nkinds of rope and stimming by getting flogged and shit.”\n\nTisa organizes an annual BDSM convention in a midwestern suburb. She looks the\nway you might expect someone in that scene to look: long purple braids that go\ndown to her waist, lots of black clothing, a bunch of piercings. She’s also a\ntotally Autistic nerd. When she’s not busy worrying about the logistics of\nsetting up a dungeon in a hotel conference center, she plays board games with\nfriends and paints miniature figurines. Tisa says her nerdy social circles and\nher kinky ones overlap massively. Both groups are filled with neurodivergent\npeople.\n\n“Autistic people love to get lost into a Dungeons and Dragons campaign for five\nhours, and some of us also love you know, the sensory experience of getting tied\nup. Both those communities are for outsiders.”\n\nAutistic people have built many niche communities from the ground up—both out of\nnecessity and because our interests and modes of being are, well, weird. If you\nwalk into any furry convention, anime club, BDSM dungeon, anarchist squat, or\ncompetitive video-game-playing circuit, I can pretty much guarantee you’re going\nto see dozens of Autistic people there, many of them in essential leadership or\norganizing positions.\n\nAutistic people created the concept of fandom. In his book NeuroTribes, Steve\nSilberman describes how Autistic nerds in the early 1900s traveled across the\ncountry by car, on foot, and even by hopping trains in order to meet people who\nshared their niche interests.[16] In the early days of science fiction, Autistic\nadults maintained the first fan magazines and traded fan fiction with one\nanother by mail and radio.[17] Autistic people helped to plan the first science\nfiction conventions, and were among the early Trekkies and fan fiction writers.\nLong before the internet existed, Autistic nerds found one another through\npersonal ads in the back of magazines. Once the internet was up and running,\nAutistic people filled it with forums, chat rooms, massively multiplayer online\ngames, and other social networks that helped them find community and\norganize.[18]\n\nIt’s not just that Autistics tend to be obsessive about hyperspecific subjects,\nand have the technical skills necessary to build these networks.[19] In fact,\nmany masked Autistics focus instead on the social and practical aspects of\nconnecting online and in person. They are often the ones to schedule the\ntabletop gaming sessions, tweak the forum settings until the site is easy on the\neyes, and write the meeting rules that keep members from fighting.\n\n“I am not the math-minded type of Autistic,” Tisa says. “I am the kind who\nthinks about people obsessively. What kind of venue will be the most comfortable\nfor folks? What chairs are good for fat bodies? How can I keep this one person\nfrom having to interact with that other person they hate? That is the kind of\nstuff I make charts about in my head.”\n\nWhen Autistic people are at the reins of event planning, we can craft\nenvironments that are tailored to our sensory and social needs, In small,\nmask-free subcultures that are created and maintained by Autistic people, we get\na glimpse of what a society that truly accepts neurodiversity might look like.\nIt turns out, an Autism-accepting world is broadly accessible to a wide array of\npeople, not just Autistics. They’re often far more comfortable for everyone.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nI used to shy away from nerdy communities, or from socializing with anybody who\ncouldn’t hide their awkwardness as well as I could. I was trying my damnedest to\nseem as normal and neurotypical as possible and feared that if I even stood near\nsomeone who violated society’s rules, I’d be outed as the freak I secretly was.\n\nI have met some particularly self-hating transgender people who exhibited the\nsame attitude about befriending anyone they think makes our community look bad.\nThey may resent very visibly trans people who put zero effort into “passing” as\ncisgender, for example, or claim that people who don’t experience debilitating\ngender dysphoria are only faking being trans for attention. It’s a horribly\nself-defeating attitude to have; it keeps us atomized, distant from, and\nresentful toward one another. Instead of building up the networks of support and\norganizing power we desperately need, our self-loathing drives us apart.\n\nThough I recognize how destructive this attitude is for trans people, I used to\nfeel that way about joining forces with fellow Autistics. It was the exact\nattitude I exhibited toward visible Autistics like my former classmate Chris.\nAround my peers, I made fun of him like everyone else did, and internally I\nobsessed over his mannerisms and movements. It’s only now, looking back with the\nbenefit of hindsight, that I realize I liked Chris and was drawn to him. He was\nsmart and interesting, and his body moved freely the way that it needed to. It\ncaptivated me, but I resented and feared those feelings. Internalized stigma\ncurdled inside me, poisoned my feelings, and made me into a self-hating bigot.\n\nIn my late twenties and early thirties, as I finally began to accept my Autistic\nidentity and meet other Autistic people, my misplaced hatred slowly dropped\naway. The first step was joining a local discussion group for genderqueer\npeople. I didn’t intend to meet Autistics there, but I had recently discovered I\nwas neurodiverse and quickly recognized some of my own traits in the other\npeople present. Everyone was a bit shy and emotionally distant, yet they’d perk\nup at the mention of their favorite manga or philosophy texts. People were\nexperimenting with unique styles and gender presentations, yet no one was\ncriticized for looking “wrong” or failing to perform gender norms correctly.\n\nThe genderqueer group’s rules and procedures also seemed to be tailor-made for\nAutistic people and our communication needs. Moderators provided a specific\ndiscussion topic each week and articulated specific rules about how to know when\nto speak, how to respect other people’s boundaries, and what to do and say if\nsomeone accidentally said something offensive. Adults my own age came to the\nmeetings with stuffed animals and other comfort items and participated without\never looking up or making eye contact. Some people arrived silently, curled up\nin cuddly heaps on the floor, and rarely said anything at all. Every few weeks\nthe group had a “blanket fort day,” where we all worked together to transform\nthe fluorescently lit meeting space into a cozy, fairy-light-decorated den lined\nwith pillows and comforters. Even a few years prior, I would’ve been ashamed to\nbring myself to such a touchy-feely space, but I was in desperate need of more\ntrans friends, and in the genderqueer group I felt at ease.\n\nAfter a few months of attending this genderqueer group, the topic of Autism came\nup. I outed myself to everyone, and found out that many of the attendees were\nthemselves neurodivergent, too. I learned from the organizers that the group’s\npolicies and structure were created with the needs of neurodiverse people in\nmind. Throughout the many years the group had run, much of its leadership had\nbeen Autistic, or later discovered they were Autistic. No wonder it was the\nfirst public space I’d truly felt at ease in as an adult. I started hanging out\nwith group members outside of the group itself, and found I wasn’t ashamed to be\na visibly identifiable member of a “weird” crowd anymore. Instead, I felt\naccepted.\n\nThese experiences made me want to branch out, to meet other weird and\nneurodivergent adults who lived openly as themselves and wouldn’t look down on\nme. So I started attending Autistic self-advocacy group meetings at the Chicago\nPublic Library. There, too, I felt instantly at ease. We all sat in staggered\npositions pointing in various directions, chatting while looking down at our\nshoes or into our phones. I felt no need to sit up straight, put my feet on the\nfloor, and fake smiles and nods in order to keep the conversation moving. It was\nbliss.\n\nThe Autistic self-advocacy group I had attended was Autistics Against Curing\nAutism Chicago, which had begun as a chapter of the national Autistic Self\nAdvocacy Network. Both versions of the group had been put together and run by\nTimotheus Gordon Jr., the Autistic researcher, self-advocate, and lover of\nfootball and Pokémon that I spoke with in Chapter 1. Much of Timotheus’s\nunmasking journey has been defined by his talent for finding and creating\ncommunity spaces that allow him to be himself—and which free up other Autistics\nto be ourselves, too.\n\nAfter a childhood and adolescence of presenting as a football-loving cool guy,\nTimotheus went away to college at the University of Minnesota. He joined a\nfraternity and made new friends there. He also began participating in slam\npoetry and meeting other nerdy people. Slowly he began to broaden how he saw\nhimself, and find like-minded folks who could appreciate every side of him.\n\n“My self in Chicago was the person wearing the mask,” he explains. “I had to be\nthe student athlete who is basically the belle of the ball or whatever you want\nto call it. The person who is into everything that society has to offer. I had\nto be the cool guy. But I found out in Minnesota that I could be myself and\nstill get a lot of attention.”\n\nWhen he moved back to Chicago a few years later (after living in Atlanta for a\nbit, and connecting with the Autistic self-advocacy community there), Timotheus\nfound he was able to deepen his existing friendships, as well as forge new ones.\nNow that he knew his full, openly Autistic self was loved and appreciated, he\ncould actually build bonds he was fully present for. He was a talented writer\nand performer. A cool guy who could light up the room with an affable smile. An\nadvocate for justice who knew how to organize and develop resources for fellow\ndisabled people. And he was a nerd who could sit at home playing games and\nrecharging for a day or two. He brought this same spirit of easygoing yet\nradical acceptance to the organizing he did for the Autistic community. He\ncentered Black and brown Autistics in his work, and ensured that the spaces he\ncreated were actively, warmly welcoming toward LGBTQ people. With the help of\nother organizers, he helped push for CESSA, the Community Emergency Services and\nSupport Act. This Illinois bill will establish a mental health response team to\naddress mental-health-related 911 calls, instead of sending police or law\nenforcement.[20] In his work, as in his social life, Timotheus has found a way\nto fully embody his values, and fight to make the city of Chicago a space where\nBlack Autistic personhood is actually respected and cherished.\n\nAround the time that I discovered the Autistic self-advocacy meetings Timotheus\norganized, I decided to make up for the childhood and adolescence I had denied\nmyself and began attending anime and comic book conventions. There I found\nAutistic bliss all over again. Everyone was dressed in comfortable, eye-catching\nclothing. You could start a conversation with someone based on their costume, or\na video-game-themed pin they were wearing. Panels were filled with interesting\npeople who looked down at their hands while overanalyzing the plots of\ndecades-old books that almost no one has read. Their unabashed passion stoked\nthe fires of my own self-love.\n\nIt wasn’t just that these various groups were filled with weird people like me.\nThey were designed to be comfortable for us. Anti-harassment policies made it\nclear how you were supposed to engage with other people, and what you were\nsupposed to do if you witnessed violence, sexual harassment, or bigotry. At many\ncons, there were apps you could use to report a problem or harassment, so even\nif you were frozen in the midst of an Autistic shutdown, you could ask for help.\nVolunteers were posted at every corner, helping people navigate the space,\nexplaining where to stand and what to do. There were sensory-friendly rooms,\nwhere anyone who was feeling overwhelmed could relax among dim lights, soft\nmusic, and snacks.\n\nI couldn’t get enough of con culture, so I started attending even more events:\nMidwest FurFest, Anime Central, International Mr. Leather. That’s when I met\nTisa, the Autistic BDSM organizer, and learned that neurodiverse organizers were\nat the heart of many of these spaces.\n\n“People say that the internet is a world for Autistics, built by Autistic\npeople,” she says. “But most IRL nerdy and kinky subcultures are, too. It takes\nan Autistic level of passion to put these things together. And a resolve to let\none’s freak flag fly.”\n\nIt’s true that Autistic people are a driving force in many of these communities.\nAt Midwest FurFest, there are multiple panels each year about Autism within the\nfurry community, because the two identities overlap so much. The Brony (My\nLittle Pony fan) community is famously dominated by Autistic children and\nadults. Netflix’s documentary about the subculture made a point of highlighting\nthat fact,[21] as have research papers on the therapeutic benefits of nerdy\nfandoms for Autistic adults and kids alike.[22] The worlds of anime, manga, and\ncomics are also heavily populated with neurodiverse people of all ages.\n\nDisabled adults help curate the panels and build spaces around people’s sensory\nneeds; they provide much of the programming, staff the booths, lovingly\nhandcraft the goods for sale in the Dealer’s Dens. It’s hard to get a good\nestimate of just how numerous Autistic people are within these subcultures, but\nit’s clear that we have helped construct them from the ground up, both because\nwe’re desperately in need of places to find belonging, and because geeky\nsubcultures provide a great outlet for our hyperfocus and a means to express our\ndifference without getting too vulnerable.[23]\n\nResearch shows that when we are around fellow neurodiverse people, Autistics\nfeel far more socially at ease.[24] We also crave friendship and belonging to\nthe same degree that allistics do.[25] Though non-Autistic people mistakenly get\nthe impression that we aren’t interested in socializing, most of us are fighting\nto find acceptance every day of our lives. When we spend time with one another,\nit’s far easier for us to get those social needs met in a way that feels genuine\nand easy.\n\nAs Reese Piper put it, “It’s neurotypicals who categorized autism as a social\ndisorder.” Autistic people don’t actually lack communication skills, or a drive\nto connect. We aren’t doomed to forever feel lonely and broken. We can step out\nof the soul-crushing cycle of reaching for neurotypical acceptance and being\nrejected despite our best efforts. Instead, we can support and uplift one\nanother, and create our own neurodiverse world where everyone—including\nneurotypicals—is welcome. In the final chapter of the book, we’ll discuss what\nsuch a world might look like. But before we discuss reshaping the world to make\nit more accommodating of us, here are some tips for finding community with\nfellow Autistics and other neurodiverse people:\n\n\nSELF-ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS\n\n * If you are in the United States, Canada, or Australia, you can look to see if\n   your area has a local affiliate chapter of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network\n   by visiting this site: https://autisticadvocacy.org/ get-involved/\n   affiliate-groups/\n\n * In the United Kingdom, you can join the Neurodiverse Self Advocacy group:\n   https://ndsa.uk/\n\n * Consider joining the Autism National Committee (https://www.autcom.org/) and\n   attending their annual conference either physically or virtually.\n\n * Look for groups that describe themselves as self-advocacy groups or\n   disability justice groups, and are run by Autistic people, for Autistic\n   people.\n\n * If a group is focused on serving the allistic family members of Autistic\n   people first and foremost, or supports searching for a “cure,” it’s most\n   likely an unsupportive environment.\n\n * Avoid Autism Speaks, and any organization that has partnered with Autism\n   Speaks.[26]\n\n * Trustworthy organizations will be run by Autistics, and allow for a variety\n   of different methods of participation, so that nonverbal Autistics and those\n   with physical disabilities are centered.\n\n\nONLINE GROUPS\n\n * On social media sites, peruse tags such as #ActuallyAutistic, #AutisticAdult,\n   #AutisticJoy, #Neurodivergent, #AutisticSelfAdvocacy, and #Neurodivergence.\n\n * Though Facebook is a less active social media platform than it once was, I\n   also recommend doing a cursory search for Autistic self-advocacy groups\n   there, particularly ones local to your area, or for specific communities\n   (Black Autistics, transgender Autistics, Autistics in eating disorder\n   recovery, etc.). Private Facebook groups can allow for more in-depth\n   conversations than some other social media sites.\n\n * On reddit, the group r/AutismTranslated is a great place for in-depth\n   discussions, resource sharing, and exploring an Autistic identity. I also\n   enjoy r/Aspergers and r/AspieMemes, and r/AutisticPride is very active.\n\n * Wrong Planet (https://wrongplanet.net/) is a long-standing forum for Autistic\n   people, ADHDers, and other neurodivergent people. It’s an old-fashioned forum\n   in its setup, making it great for slow, in-depth conversations.\n\n * As you search through tags and find accounts to follow, look for communities\n   that center Black and brown Autistic voices, transgender Autistics, nonverbal\n   Autistics, and that encourage healthy conflict and dissent.\n\n * Avoid groups and pages that are for non-Autistic parents of Autistic kids,\n   accounts that infantilize Autistics or oversimplify our experiences, and\n   accounts where individuals overgeneralize their experiences as representative\n   of all Autistic people.\n\n\nSPECIAL INTEREST MEETUPS\n\n * A great way to meet like-minded neurodivergent people is by joining\n   communities devoted to a special interest you both share. Search online to\n   find local comic book groups, D&D groups seeking new players, anime or\n   cosplay clubs, foraging groups, hiking groups, or clubs devoted to anything\n   that interests you.\n\n * If a cursory online search doesn’t turn up any groups you’re interested in,\n   look for events and clubs run by your local library, bookstore, comic book\n   shop, queer community center, gay bar, BDSM dungeon, park district, café, or\n   collectible shop.\n\n * Though both platforms are less active than they once were, Facebook and\n   Meetup.com are still useful places for finding groups that share common\n   interests with you, as well as gatherings for those with social anxiety or\n   who aren’t confident in their social skills.\n\n * Look for conventions related to your special interests that visit your area,\n   and join online communities related to them. Often there is a robust local\n   community that holds smaller meetups and events throughout the year.\n\n * Since groups devoted to shared interests aren’t explicitly for Autistic\n   people, try to gather information on their accessibility policies. Though\n   there are many Autistic anime nerds, for example, there is also a contingent\n   of the community that is ableist, racist, and has alt-right leanings. This is\n   true of almost any broad community; it may take some digging to find out\n   which spaces are safe for you and align with your values.\n\n\nGENERAL TIPS AND THINGS TO LOOK OUT FOR\n\n * It’s pretty common to feel awkward or out of place the first time you meet\n   someone new or attend an event. Unless a serious red flag occurs, I recommend\n   giving a new space three visits before you conclude it’s a bad fit.\n\n * Pay attention to who is encouraged to attend an event or access a space, and\n   who is overlooked or discouraged. Are meetings in a neighborhood that’s\n   easier for wealthy white people to access? Is the location accessible to\n   people in wheelchairs?\n\n * While there is no such thing as a fully accessible group (because some people\n   have incompatible or competing access needs), groups should do their best to\n   accommodate both current and potential attendees. Are there nonverbal and\n   asynchronous (that is, not live) ways to participate? Are the sensory needs\n   of attendees anticipated (for example, with policies banning strong\n   fragrances)?\n\n * As you get better acquainted with a group, take note of how conflict and\n   critique are handled. Does leadership welcome critique and take it seriously?\n   Are members able to handle heathy conflict and treat it as a source of\n   growth, or is there a lot of pressure to “smooth things over” as quickly as\n   possible? Does it feel like a space where you are free to change your mind on\n   something or be wrong?\n\n * If you have been masked all your life, you probably will experience some\n   anxiety in Autistic-centered spaces. You might even find yourself judging\n   other people’s behavior. Remember that this is completely normal. Society has\n   drilled very particular, often cruel rules into your head, and it can be\n   jarring at first to see people violating some of them. Over time, you will\n   get more comfortable with visibly neurodivergent behavior—and this will make\n   it easier for you to open up, too."},{"title":"Test Section Title","content":"CHAPTER 1\n\n\nWHAT IS AUTISM, REALLY?\n\nWhen Crystal was young, she exhibited many behaviors psychologists today would\nrecognize as traditionally Autistic: she lined up toys in rows instead of\nplaying pretend with them, chewed on her blanket while staring at the wall, and\nhad trouble understanding in-jokes and teasing. But she didn’t “look Autistic\nenough” to get easily diagnosed in the 1990s, when she was growing up.\n\n“My mom actually thought I should get assessed,” she says. “But my grandpa shut\nit down. He was all, no, no way, Crystal’s such a good girl! There’s nothing\nwrong with her. Don’t even think about stuff like that.”\n\nCrystal’s grandfather probably figured he was protecting her from getting stuck\nwith a label that would bring a lifetime of abuse. He certainly isn’t alone in\nthat. Label avoidance (taking steps to evade diagnosis) is a very common\nconsequence of disability and mental health stigma.[1] Publicly identifying as\ndisabled does mean being viewed as less competent—and less human—by many people.\nAs damaging and self-defeating as it can be to camouflage one’s disability\nstatus, it is by no means a paranoid act. It’s a rational reflection of the\nprejudices disabled people face. It’s not unique to Autism, either; many people\nwith mental illnesses[2] and hidden physical disabilities[3] elect to avoid the\nmark of shame a diagnosis might bring.\n\nMy dad hid his cerebral palsy and seizure disorder for his entire life. No one\nknew about his condition other than my grandmother, my mom, and eventually me.\nHe never went to college because he would have needed to reveal his access needs\nto campus disability services. He only ever applied to jobs that didn’t require\nhim to write or type, lest his poor fine motor control be revealed. As a child,\nI typed up the flyers for his lawn mowing business, because he couldn’t work the\ncomputer himself. I only found out about his condition as a teenager; he\nsobbingly confessed it to me, as if it were a terrible secret, after his\nmarriage to my mother had already fallen apart. He told me that his mother had\nmade him hide his condition because it wouldn’t have been acceptable to be\nopenly disabled in the tiny Appalachian town where he grew up. Shame and\nself-loathing followed him until the day that he died of diabetes (a condition\nhe developed as an adult and also refused to treat).\n\nI didn’t find out I was Autistic until many years after his death, but he was\nthe first person who demonstrated to me just how painful and self-destructive\nhiding your disability can be. He had erected an entire life around hiding who\nhe was, and his defensive mechanisms had slowly killed him.\n\nLabel avoidance was common among the parents of potentially Autistic children\nduring the 1990s, because the condition was so poorly understood and\ndemonized.[4] Autistic people were assumed to be intellectually disabled, and\nintellectually disabled people were not valued or respected, so many families\ndid their damnedest to keep the label off their kids’ backs. Though Crystal’s\ngrandfather intended to protect her from bigotry, and from being infantilized,\nhe also denied her important self-knowledge, educational resources, and a place\nin the Autistic community. Without consulting Crystal, her family determined it\nwould be better for her to suffer and hide her neurodiversity than to have a\nname for her marginalized position in the world. The weight of this decision is\none Crystal continues to deal with now, as an adult who was diagnosed in her\nlate twenties.\n\n“Now I know I’m Autistic, but I kinda found out about it too late,” she says.\n“If I tell people, they don’t want to believe me. I have my life together too\nmuch for them to realize how hard it all is. Nobody wants to hear now about how\nhard it’s always been, always still is, frankly.”\n\nAt this point, I have heard hundreds of Autistic people tell versions of\nCrystal’s story. Some of the details change, but the narrative arc is always the\nsame: A child exhibits early signs of difficulty, but their families and\nteachers balk when disability is raised. Parents or grandparents who themselves\nhave Autism spectrum traits dismiss the child’s complaints, claiming that\neverybody suffers from the social stress, sensory sensitivities, stomach issues,\nor cognitive fuzziness they themselves experience. Everyone in the child’s life\nviews disability not as an explanation of how a person functions (and what help\nthey need in order to function), but a sign of damage. So they push the label\naway, and tell their child to stop making such a fuss. Believing they are\nhelping their child “rise above” a limitation and be tough, they encourage the\nchild not to be visibly odd, or to ever ask for assistance.\n\nThough a masked Autistic child has no way of explaining why they find life so\ndifficult, they suffer all the same. Peers detect there’s something unnameably\n“off” about them, and exclude them despite their best attempts at friendliness.\nWhen the child makes themselves small and inobtrusive, they’re granted some of\nthe affection they desperately crave and never get enough of. So they do it more\nand more, quieting the voice inside themselves that says how they’re being\ntreated isn’t fair. They work hard, demand little, and play by society’s rules\nas closely as possible. They grow into an adult who is even more self-effacing,\nand even less capable of voicing how they feel. Then, after decades of forcing\nthemselves into a restrictive neurotypical box, they have some kind of breakdown\nthat finally makes all the turmoil bubbling beneath the surface impossible to\nignore. It’s only then that they discover they’re Autistic.\n\nIn Crystal’s case, the breaking point took the form of a months-long case of\nAutistic burnout. Autistic burnout is a state of chronic exhaustion where an\nAutistic person’s skills begin to degrade, and their tolerance to stress is\ngreatly reduced.[5] It hit Crystal like a Mack truck after she completed her\nsenior thesis in college. College had taken her a few years longer than the rest\nof her friends, though she couldn’t explain exactly why. She was always having\nto drop classes in order to hold her life together. A full course load just\nwasn’t possible. When people asked about it, she lied and said she also worked a\nfull-time job.\n\nIn her final year of college, Crystal was required to oversee set design for the\ntheater department’s biggest show of the year. Designing dozens of props,\nsourcing their materials, managing the building of them, and then keeping track\nof all the items in a big Google spreadsheet was simply too stressful for her to\nmanage, especially while taking her final remaining classes. She pushed through,\nlosing hair and losing weight, but once the project was completed, she\ncollapsed.\n\n“After I graduated, I was in bed at my mom’s house for three months,” she says.\n“Didn’t apply to jobs. I barely showered, had all these McDonald’s wrappers on\nthe floor of my bedroom, and my family still insisted I was just being lazy.”\n\nEventually, Crystal became so lethargic that she no longer wanted to watch TV or\nplay with the family dog. That was concerning enough for her mother to suggest\nshe go see a therapist. An Autism assessment came shortly thereafter.\n\n“At first I couldn’t believe it,” Crystal says. “My family still doesn’t believe\nit. They had every indication, my whole life, but they don’t want to see it.”\n\nAt last, Crystal had an explanation for why she couldn’t get as much done as\nother people, and why basic-seeming tasks like running to the bank or sitting\nthrough a two-hour lecture left her too tired to think or speak. Regular life\nactually did require more willpower out of her; Autistic people frequently\nexperience inertia in starting a task,[6] and challenges in breaking complex\nactivities down into small steps that follow a logical sequence.[7] This can\nmake everything from basic household chores to applying to jobs and filing taxes\nincredibly challenging, or even impossible without help.\n\nIn addition to all the baseline cognitive and sensory challenges that came with\nAutism for Crystal, she was also having to put a lot of energy into always\nseeming “normal.” She constantly fought the urge to suck on her fingers, and\nwhen people spoke to her, she had to forcibly point her attention at their words\nand face. Reading a book took her twice as long as the average person. All she\nhad the energy to do at the end of the day was sit in bed and eat french fries.\nCrystal’s mother and grandfather were unsatisfied by this newfound explanation,\nthough. They said that if she had really been hurting that bad all her life,\nthey would have realized it.\n\n“I wish I could make them understand,” she says, “Autism isn’t what you think.”\n\n\nDEFINING AUTISM\n\nOne of the reasons Autism often gets overlooked in women like Crystal is a\nfundamental misunderstanding that professionals and the public have about what\nAutism even is. Until fairly recently, most people believed Autism was rare,\nthat only young boys had it, and that it was always easy to see. Think of Dustin\nHoffman’s portrayal in the film Rain Man: he’s institutionalized as a child\nbecause he’s profoundly disabled and too “difficult” to have at home, he never\ngives eye contact, wanders off dangerously when not closely watched, and has a\npreternatural talent for math that his nondisabled brother exploits for personal\ngain. This is how all of us were trained to view the disability: a horrible\ncondition that renders you freakish and helpless, your life only as valuable as\nyour savant-like skills are to other people.\n\nBy the mid-1990s, when Crystal was a kid, some people also had a vague awareness\nof what was then called Asperger’s Disorder. Asperger’s was stereotyped as a\n“higher functioning” flavor of Autism found in really smart, nerdy, usually rude\nmen who worked in fields like tech. In both forms, Autism was associated with\nbeing awkward and uncaring (and male) with a penchant for numbers. People had\nlittle to no understanding of Autism’s causes, what it felt like to be an\nAutistic person, or that the disability shares features with other disorders\nlike epilepsy, Social Anxiety Disorder, Attention-Deficit Hyperactive Disorder\n(ADHD), or Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).\n\nDespite what people believe, Autism is not defined by rudeness, masculinity, or\nhaving any kind of mathematical skill. In the scientific literature, it’s\narguable whether the disability should even be defined by the presence of clear\nbehavioral signs, such as trouble reading social cues or hesitating to initiate\ncontact with other people.[8] Instead of looking to the external signals of\nAutism that others might pick up on, it’s important that we instead focus on the\nneurobiological markers of the neurotype, and the internal experiences and\nchallenges that Autistic people themselves report.\n\nAutism is neurological. Autism is a developmental disability that runs in\nfamilies[9] and appears to be largely genetically heritable.[10] However, it is\nalso multiply determined, meaning it has no single cause: a whole host of\ndifferent genes appear to be associated with Autism,[11] and every Autistic\nperson’s brain is unique and exhibits its own distinct patterns of\nconnectivity.[12] Autism is a developmental disability because compared to\nneurotypical milestones, it comes with delays: many Autistic people continue to\ngrow in their social and emotional skills for much later in life than allistics\ntend to.[13] (However, this may be due to the fact that Autistic people are\nforced to develop our own social and emotional coping skills from scratch,\nbecause the neurotypical methods taught to us don’t suit how we process\ninformation—more on this later.) Autism is associated with specific and\npervasive differences in the brain, which result in us diverging from\nneurotypical standards, in terms of how our brains filter and make sense of\ninformation.\n\nAutistic people have differences in the development of their anterior cingulate\ncortex,[14] a part of the brain that helps regulate attention, decision making,\nimpulse control, and emotional processing. Throughout our brains, Autistic\npeople have delayed and reduced development of Von Economo neurons (or VENs),\nbrain cells that help with rapid, intuitive processing of complex\nsituations.[15] Similarly, Autistic brains differ from allistic brains in how\nexcitable our neurons are.[16] To put it in very simple terms, our neurons\nactivate easily, and don’t discriminate as readily between a “nuisance variable”\nthat our brains might wish to ignore (for example, a dripping faucet in another\nroom) and a crucial piece of data that deserves a ton of our attention (for\nexample, a loved one beginning to quietly cry in the other room). This means we\ncan both be easily distracted by a small stimulus and miss a large meaningful\none.\n\nAutistic brains have unique connection patterns that deviate from what is\nnormally observed in neurotypical people. When infants are born, their brains\nare typically hyperconnected; much of human development is a process of slowly\npruning unhelpful connections and becoming more efficient at responding to one’s\nenvironment, based on life experience and learning. In Autistic brains, however,\nresearchers have found that some regions remain hyperconnected throughout the\nlife span, whereas other regions may be underconnected (relatively speaking). It\nis difficult to sum up these connectivity patterns because, as neurobiologists\nat the Weizmann Institute of Science have found, every Autistic brain exhibits a\ndifferent connectivity pattern. Our brain wiring appears to actually be more\ndiverse than the wiring of neurotypical brains, which researchers believe have a\nconsistent pruning pattern.[17] The researchers at the Weizmann Institute have\ntheorized that this means Autistic brains respond to our environments\ndifferently; whereas neurotypical brains are believed to readily adapt to the\nsensory and social input they receive from the outside world, Autistic brain\ndevelopment and pruning appears to be “disrupted.”[18]\n\nAutistic people also exhibit less of what neuroscientists call global-to-local\ninterference:[19] we are inclined to zero in on small details, even when those\ndetails don’t jibe with the overall “big picture” that a non-Autistic person\nmight see. For example, one series of studies found that Autistic people are far\nbetter than allistics at copying down a drawing of a distorted 3-D object that\ncouldn’t exist in real life.[20] Allistics got caught off guard by how\nimpossible and illogical the overall image was, whereas Autistics could just\nfocus on the individual lines and shapes that made up the image, and re-create\nthe drawing from the bottom up. This high degree of attention to detail also\napplies to how we navigate social situations: we focus on the small features of\na person’s face rather than taking in their likeness or emotional expression as\na whole, for instance.[21] This helps explain why many Autistic people have\nprosopagnosia (the inability to recognize faces),[22] and experience difficulty\nreading emotions on neurotypicals’ faces.\n\nTogether, all of this means that Autistic people tend to have the following\nqualities:\n\n * We are hyperreactive to even small stimuli in our environment\n\n * We have trouble distinguishing between information or sensory data that\n   should be ignored versus data that should be carefully considered\n\n * We are highly focused on details rather than “big picture” concepts\n\n * We’re deeply and deliberatively analytical\n\n * Our decision-making process is methodical rather than efficient; we don’t\n   rely on mental shortcuts or “gut feelings”\n\n * Processing a situation takes us more time and energy than it does for a\n   neurotypical person\n\nNow that I’ve explained some of the neurological markers correlated with Autism,\nI think it’s important to clarify a finer point: the fact that a disability has\nsome biological markers does not mean it is more “real” or legitimate than a\ndisability that you can only observe in a person’s behavior. And Autism is still\ndiagnosed based on behavior and reported challenges the Autistic person is\nfacing, not on a brain scan. The fact that Autism has neurological features\ndoesn’t mean it is a more sympathetic disability than, say, an eating disorder\nor substance addiction. It also doesn’t mean Autistics are doomed to always\nfunction in a particular way, or to always struggle.\n\nWhile understanding the biology of human difference is helpful in a lot of ways,\nthere are real risks to reducing a disability to its physical “causes.” It can\nlead people to believe that our biology is our destiny, and that we are lesser\nto neurotypicals in some unchangeable way. In fact, some research suggests that\nwhen people understand disabilities such as depression and ADHD as being purely\nbiological, they actually show more stigma toward people with those conditions,\nnot less.[23] The idea that a disabled group can’t help being the way they are\nis dehumanizing and restrictive, even though some also find it liberating and\nvalidating.\n\nWhen society first starts flirting with accepting a marginalized group, that\nacceptance is often wrapped up in a born this way type narrative. For example,\nin the early 2000s, many straight allies claimed to support gay people because\nbeing gay wasn’t a choice, and we couldn’t help being the way that we are. There\nwas a lot of pop science writing at that time exploring the search for the “gay\ngene,”[24] and suggesting that certain hormone exposures in the womb might\npredispose a fetus to being gay. Today we don’t have conversations about the\nbiological causes of gayness very much anymore. In the United States at least,\nbeing gay has started becoming accepted enough that queer people don’t have to\njustify our existence by saying we can’t help but be this way. If someone were\nto choose to be gay, that wouldn’t be a problem, because being gay is good.\nSimilarly, Autistic people deserve acceptance, not because we can’t help but\nhave the brains we have, but because being Autistic is good.\n\nAutism is associated with a deliberative processing style. When making sense of\nthe world, Autistic people usually defer to logic and reason rather than emotion\nor intuition. We dive deep into all the pros and cons, sometimes excessively so,\nnot knowing where to draw the line between an important variable and an\nunimportant one. We tend not to get habituated to familiar situations or stimuli\nas readily as other people, so we often think through a situation as if it’s\ncompletely new to us, even if it isn’t.[25] All of this requires a lot of\nenergy, focus, and time, so we get exhausted and overloaded quite easily.\nHowever, it also makes us less prone to errors. Experimental research shows that\nAutistic people are far less susceptible to the biases allistic people commonly\nfall prey to.[26] For example, consider this relatively simple problem:\n\n> A bat and a ball together cost $1.10. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball.\n> How much does the ball cost?\n\nIn experimental studies, over 80 percent of non-Autistic people get this\nquestion wrong. They parse the question quickly, go with their gut, and answer\nthat the ball must cost ten cents.[27] The correct answer is that the ball costs\nfive cents, and the bat costs a dollar more, $1.05, which together adds up to\n$1.10. It takes an extra moment of careful processing to skip the “obvious” (and\nwrong) answer and provide the correct one. For most allistic people, the default\nway of thinking is to go with what’s obvious. But since Autistic people do not\nprocess information intuitively, we don’t see “obvious” answers to things, and\nhave to carefully break the question down instead. This results in us being far\nmore likely to get the answer right.\n\nThis slow, deliberative style of processing comes with its fair share of\ndownsides. We can’t always pick up on irony or “obvious” implied meanings people\nhaven’t said explicitly. Allistic people often accuse us of overthinking things,\nor being too slow and hesitant to come up with a response. We also get\noverwhelmed when presented with mountains of data, which neurotypical people\nfind much easier to just ignore.\n\nAutistic people process the world from the bottom up. If you want to understand\nAutism as a disability and a source of human difference at a glance, it’s best\nsummed up this way: we process in a careful, systematic, bottom-up way. Allistic\nfolks, in contrast, make sense of the world in a very top-down fashion. They’ll\nenter a new environment, such as an unfamiliar restaurant, take a quick look\naround, and jump to reasonable conclusions about how to order, where to sit,\nwhat kind of service to expect, and even how loudly they should talk. Their\nbrains will immediately begin to filter through sounds, lights, and other\nstimuli, and adjust accordingly. They might notice a clanging pinball machine in\nthe corner for a moment, for instance, but soon habituate to it, and become able\nto ignore it. When the waiter approaches, they probably can chat without much\ndifficulty, even if something unexpected gets said or the item they planned to\norder is sold out. They don’t rely on memorized conversational scripts, and they\ndon’t have to carefully parse every single piece of data they encounter to make\nsense of it. They can wing it.\n\nAutistic people, on the flip side, don’t rely on knee-jerk assumptions or quick\nmental shortcuts to make our decisions. We process each element of our\nenvironment separately, and intentionally, taking very little for granted. If\nwe’ve never been in a particular restaurant before, we may be slow to make sense\nof its layout or figure out how ordering works. We’ll need really clear-cut\nindications of whether it’s the kind of place where you sit down and get table\nservice, or if you’re supposed to go to a counter to ask for what you like.\n(Many of us try to camouflage this fact by doing extensive research on a\nrestaurant before setting foot inside.) Every single light, laugh, and smell in\nthe place is taken in individually by our sensory system, rather than blended\ninto a cohesive whole. To cope with unpredictability, we analyze our experiences\nfor patterns, and memorize rule sets: if the waiter says X, I reply with Y. When\nsomething unexpected happens, we have to carefully sort out how to respond. Too\nmuch change may cause us to become really exhausted, or to freak out.\n\nAutism touches every part of the Autistic person’s life. Of course, many\nnon-Autistic people might resonate with some of the feelings and sensations I\njust described. There’s a difference between being allistic (which simply means\nnon-Autistic) and being fully neurotypical (which means lacking any mental\nillness or cognitive disability). An allistic person with a social anxiety\ndisorder may also feel overwhelmed in busy bars and restaurants, just as\nAutistic people do. Someone with post-traumatic stress disorder may similarly be\nrattled by a noisy pinball machine. The difference between Autism and these\nother disorders, however, is that Autism is a cognitive and sensory difference\nthat affects every area of life. You wouldn’t expect a socially anxious person\nto get overwhelmed by the sound of a clanking radiator when they’re alone at\nhome, for example (unless they’re also Autistic or have a sensory processing\ndisorder).\n\nBecause the neural and cognitive features of Autism are so pervasive, it affects\nalmost every aspect of a person’s body and brain. It’s related to coordination\nand muscle tone, the ability to read emotions on people’s faces, communication\nskills, reaction time, and even how a person recognizes feelings of pain or\nhunger.[28] When I look at a person’s face, I don’t simply see “happiness” or\n“sadness” radiating off them, for example; I see minute changes in their eyes,\nforehead, mouth, breathing, and posture, which I then have to effortfully piece\ntogether to make an informed guess about how they feel. Often, it’s too much\ndiscordant data to make sense of. When I don’t have the energy to carefully\nprocess others’ emotional expressions, people are inscrutable to me and arouse a\nlot of anxiety.\n\nAutism can influence how intensely we focus on an activity, and how we perceive\ntextures, tastes, and sounds.[29] Autism can predispose a person to having\nfanatical interests (often referred to as special interests)[30] and to\nfollowing rules very rigidly. Many of us have trouble identifying sarcasm or\nreading nonverbal signals. Disruptions to our routines or expectations can make\nus panic. Learning new skills may take us far longer than other people.\n\nAutism is behavioral. Autism is associated with repetitive self-stimulatory\nbehavior (“stimming”),[31] which can be something as benign as hand-flapping, or\nas severe as chewing one’s fingers until they bleed. Stimming is an important\nmeans of self-regulation. It helps soothe us when we’re anxious or overloaded\nwith stress, and it helps us express joy and enthusiasm. There are a variety of\nways to stim, and stimming can make use of any of the five senses. Some of us\nstim using echolalia, the repeating of words, sounds, or phrases that feel good\nvibrating in our throats. Others stim by engaging the body’s proprioceptive\nsystem (the neural system that tracks the body’s physical movement) by jumping\nup and down or swaying in place. Sucking on candy, smelling scented candles,\nstaring at lava lamps, listening to recordings of rain and thunder—all of these\nactivities can be stims. All humans stim to an extent (if they didn’t, fidget\nspinners wouldn’t have become so popular several years ago), but Autistic people\nstim more frequently, more repetitively, and more intensely than neurotypicals\ndo.\n\nRepetitiveness is a key feature of Autistic behavior, according to the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (the DSM). And it is true\nthat many of us crave the stability that repetition provides. Because we find\nthe external social world so unpredictable, most of us prefer consistent\nroutines. We often eat the same meals over and over again, or only enjoy a\nlimited range of foods (sometimes called samefoods in the community). We\nhyperfixate on activities that we enjoy and can get so engrossed in them that we\nforget to eat or take a break to stretch our legs. We echo phrases from movies\nand TV because they help us emulate “normal” social behavior, or because we lack\nour own words for how we are feeling, or simply because the sounds feel pleasant\nto have vibrating in our vocal cords. Even having special interests can be\nviewed as a repetitive behavior. Many of us watch the same movies over and over\nor read and compile facts about our favorite subjects far beyond the point that\nan allistic person would find entertaining.\n\nFor many masked Autistic people, however, repetitive behavior is something that\nneeds to remain hidden. If you chew your fingers a lot or keep humming the same\nthree-note tune to yourself, people will notice and mock you for it. If you come\nacross as too obsessed with a weird subject (say, mortuary science), people will\nbe put off by your enthusiasm and keep their distance. Most of us have to figure\nout ways to conceal our stimming and special interests. We might maintain a\nsecret blog about our interests, for example, or find socially acceptable ways\nto get our energy out, such as long-distance running or fidgeting with our\nphones.\n\nAutistic people are at risk. Timotheus Gordon Jr. is an Autistic researcher,\nadvocate, and the founder of Autistics Against Curing Autism Chicago. He tells\nme that for him, choosing to stim (or how to stim) is highly dependent on which\nneighborhood he’s in, and how people are likely to react.\n\n“Walking into certain neighborhoods in Chicago or in the Chicagoland area, I\ncan’t wear my headphones to enjoy music,” he says, “otherwise I’ll get robbed\npotentially. Or if I walk around and fidget with toys, police or certain people\nin the neighborhood will think I’m strange or doing something illegal and I\nmight get arrested, killed, or beat up.”\n\nTimotheus says that in some circumstances, he masks his need to stim by choosing\na more socially acceptable outlet, such as bouncing a basketball. As a Black\nAutistic person, he is frequently having to take the temperature of his\nsurroundings, gauging how others will react to his actions, and modulating\nhimself accordingly. The risks of being himself are simply too great to take for\ngranted.\n\nAutistic people are at a high risk of violence, as well as negative mental\nhealth outcomes. Since we can’t openly stim or engage in other repetitive\nbehaviors, some masked Autistic people reach for flawed coping strategies to\nhelp manage stress. We’re at an elevated risk of eating disorders,[32]\nalcoholism and drug addiction,[33] and insecure attachments to others.[34] We\ntend to maintain shallow relationships, out of fear that people would hate\ngetting to know our “real selves.” We may withdraw from other people, leading to\nnegative emotional and psychological outcomes. And the more isolated we are, the\nless practice we get socializing, leading to a feedback loop of social\ndisempowerment and shame.\n\nAutism is also highly correlated with physical symptoms such as gastrointestinal\nissues,[35] connective tissue disorders,[36] and seizures[37] largely for\ngenetic reasons. It co-occurs with other disabilities such as Attention Deficit\nHyperactive Disorder (ADHD)[38] and dyslexia at a high rate.[39] Many Autistic\npeople have trauma histories and post-traumatic stress symptoms, and as I’ve\nalready mentioned, a lifetime of masking puts us at a high risk of conditions\nlike depression and anxiety.[40] These are some of the most common conditions\nthat co-occur alongside Autism, but later in the book we’ll discuss additional\ndisorders that overlap (or are mistaken for) Autism.\n\nAutism is a neurodivergence. Autism is a type of functioning (or a neurotype)\nthat differs from what psychology defines as normative or neurotypical (NT).\nAutism is a particularly diverse and varied form of neurodivergence; there are\njust so many ways in which we are punished for deviating from the norm. Every\ncase of Autism is a bit different, and traits can present in seemingly\ncontradictory ways. Some Autistic people can’t speak; others are incredibly\nhyperverbal from a young age, with huge vocabularies. Some Autistics can read\npeople’s emotions so easily that it’s overwhelming; others empathize with\nanimals or objects, but not people; some of us have zero emotional empathy.[41]\nBut all of us are full-formed humans with a capacity to care for others and\nbehave ethically. Some Autistic people have no “special interests”; others are\nfanatical about dozens of subjects. Some of us have skills we are adept at;\nothers need help in every facet of our existence. What unites us, generally\nspeaking, is a bottom-up processing style that impacts every aspect of our lives\nand how we move through the world, and the myriad practical and social\nchallenges that come with being different.\n\nSince mainstream standards for behavior are so narrow, there are a variety of\nways in which a person can diverge—and be punished for diverging. Having\nfrequent panic attacks is a neurodivergence, as is exhibiting signs of an eating\ndisorder. If you struggle in your close relationships because of attachment\ntrauma or an inescapable fear of rejection, you’re neurodivergent too (you might\nalso get stuck with a particularly stigmatizing label, such as Borderline\nPersonality Disorder).\n\nAlmost anyone can be viewed as defective or abnormal under our current\nmedicalized model of mental illness—at least during particularly trying periods\nof their lives when they are depressed or their coping breaks down. In this way,\nneurotypicality is more of an oppressive cultural standard than it actually is a\nprivileged identity a person has. Essentially no one lives up to neurotypical\nstandards all of the time, and the rigidity of those standards harms\neveryone.[42] Much as heteronormativity harms straight and queer folks alike,\nneurotypicality hurts people no matter their mental health status.\n\nAutism is just one source of neurodiversity in our world. The term neurodiverse\nrefers to the wide spectrum of individuals whose thoughts, emotions, or\nbehaviors have been stigmatized as unhealthy, abnormal, or dangerous. The term\nwas coined in 1999 by sociologist Judy Singer. In her honor’s thesis, Singer\nwrote about the difficulty of making sense of her daughter’s disabilities, which\nclosely resembled traits her own mother exhibited when Singer was growing up. At\nthe point that Singer was writing, Autism was poorly understood, and adults with\nAutistic traits, such as Singer’s mother (and Singer herself) rarely received\ndiagnoses. Singer’s daughter seemed to inhabit a space somewhere between Autism,\nADHD, and a variety of other disabilities. All three women were difficult to\nneatly categorize, which only obscured just how marginalized and socially adrift\nthey all were. Just because their challenges couldn’t be easily named didn’t\nmean they didn’t exist.\n\n“My life as a parent was a battleground for various belief systems,” she\nwrites,[43] “all of which had one thing in common: an inability to come to terms\nwith human variability.”\n\nSinger and her family were disabled in a way that no one knew how to name, so\nshe created a name for them: they were neurodiverse, and they suffered because\nthe world demanded they be neurotypical. These terms would be popularized by\njournalist Harvey Blume and widely adopted by disability advocates a few years\nlater. The label neurodiverse includes everyone from people with ADHD, to Down\nSyndrome, to Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, to Borderline Personality Disorder.\nIt also includes people with brain injuries or strokes, people who have been\nlabeled “low intelligence,” and people who lack any formal diagnosis, but have\nbeen pathologized as “crazy” or “incompetent” throughout their lives. As Singer\nrightly observed, neurodiversity isn’t actually about having a specific,\ncatalogued “defect” that the psychiatric establishment has an explanation for.\nIt’s about being different in a way others struggle to understand or refuse to\naccept.\n\nAutism is diverse. Though the neurological and mental features of Autism cut\nacross a wide swathe of people, the way it presents is always a bit different.\nIn fact, Autistic traits can manifest in downright paradoxical ways. At times, I\ncan be so intensely focused on a task (such as reading or writing) that the rest\nof the world entirely drops away. When I’m hyperfixating, I fail to notice\nthings like someone speaking to me or smoke filling the room because I forgot to\nturn the oven off. At other times, I’m an anxious and distractible wreck, unable\nto make my way through a single sentence of a book because my pet chinchilla is\nhopping around in his cage and making the bars rattle. These two very disparate\nresponses have the same root cause: the overexcitability of Autistic people’s\nneurons and the inconsistent way that we filter stimuli (at least compared to\nallistics). We tend to be both easily disturbed by sound in our environment, and\nunable to tell when a noise actually merits our attention, at the same time.[44]\nI often brute-force my way into paying attention to something by shutting the\nrest of the world out. I think it’s also likely that lifelong masking has\nrendered me hypervigilant, almost as a trauma response. My sensory system is\nused to scanning the environment, to determine whether I’m alone and thus “safe”\nenough to be myself. Trauma survivors often become hypervigilant, which tends to\ncome with intense sensory issues.[45] Some researchers have also theorized that\nsensory issues in Autistics are, at least in part, caused by the anxiety and\nhypervigilance we experience from living in a world that doesn’t accommodate us,\nand often treats us with hostility.[46]\n\nMost people have heard that Autism is a spectrum, and it’s really true: each of\nus has a unique constellation of traits and features, all at various degrees of\nintensity. Some people are also subclinically Autistic, meaning they might not\nqualify for an official diagnosis, in the eyes of psychiatrists, but share\nenough struggles and experiences with us that they belong in the community.\nRelatives of diagnosed Autistic people, for example, frequently are found to\nexhibit subclinical traits.[47] Of course, what’s considered to be “subclinical”\nis often more a function of a person’s ability to hold down a job and conform to\nsocietal rules than it is a reflection of how much they are suffering.\n\n“Everybody is a little bit Autistic,” is a common refrain that masked Autistic\npeople hear when we come out to others. This remark can feel a bit grating to\nhear, because it feels like our experiences are being downplayed. It’s similar\nto when bisexual people get told that “everybody is a little bit bi.” When most\npeople make remarks like these, they’re implying that because our difference is\nso universal, we can’t actually be oppressed for it, and should just shut up\nabout it. However, I do think that when allistic people declare that everyone is\na little Autistic, it means they are close to making an important breakthrough\nabout how mental disorders are defined: why do we declare some people broken,\nand others perfectly normal, when they exhibit the exact same traits? Where do\nwe draw the line, and why do we even bother doing so? If an Autistic person\nbenefits from more flexibility at work, and more social patience, why not extend\nthose same benefits to everybody? Autistic people are a normal part of humanity,\nand we have qualities that can be observed in any other non-Autistic human. So\nyes, everyone is a little bit Autistic. That’s all the more reason to broaden\nour definition of what is deserving of dignity and acceptance.\n\nAutism can appear in any person, regardless of their age, class, gender, race,\nor other disability status. Despite the incredible diversity of Autism and\nAutistic people, the average person (and even many mental health professionals)\nhas a singular image of Autism in their minds. You might sometimes hear this\ncalled “typically presenting” Autism, though that’s really a misnomer. It’s more\nlike stereotypical Autism.\n\n\n“TYPICAL” AUTISM\n\n“Typical” Autism is visible from an early age, and usually results in a\ndiagnosis by the time a child is in early elementary school. Typical Autistics\ndon’t communicate the way neurotypical society wants them to; they might be\nnonverbal or slow to develop speech, and they avoid gazing at other people or\napproaching them. They engage in repetitive behaviors that are recognizable:\nthey rock in place, slap themselves in the head, or yell and chirp. Their\nsensory pain and social overwhelm is near-constant, and they can’t hide how\nprofoundly they’re suffering. Their parents have trouble managing their\nmeltdowns and sensory overloads, seeing these responses as “behavioral issues,”\nor “noncompliance.” They may complain Autism has “stolen” their once\nwell-behaved baby from them. Typical Autistics are probably boys, and they’re\nprobably white, and they are likely to come from wealthy or upper-middle-class\nfamilies who can access diagnosis and therapeutic support (and who tend to have\npretty restrictive norms of what constitutes “appropriate” public behavior).\n\nIn reality, typical Autistics aren’t all that typical. The vast majority of\nAutistic people who have been diagnosed flout this incredibly rigid set of\ncriteria in one way or another.[48] That’s despite the fact all existing\ndiagnostic tools for Autism were developed with wealthy, white,\ngender-conforming boys in mind. When we consider the evidence that Autism is\nunderdiagnosed in girls, Black, indigenous, Asian, and Latinx people,[49] and\nthose in poverty,[50] among other groups, we can see that “typical” Autism is\nprobably even less typical than official figures would have us believe.\n\nThe line between “typical” Autism and “atypical” Autism is quite permeable, and\noften has more to do with a person’s position in society than it does the\nsupposed severity of their Autistic traits. Crystal had all the classic\nindicators of Autism: repetitive play, lack of social engagement,\nself-stimulatory behavior, difficulty staying on task at school. But because\nCrystal didn’t look like the “typical” Autistic person, she didn’t register as\ndisabled to most of the world. For all the distress she was in, teachers and\nschool counselors never again raised it as a possibility.\n\n“Report cards called me a joy to have in class, and sensitive,” she says. “Which\nwas a sneaky way of saying they thought I cried too much and got too hurt when\nkids were mean to me. Spacing out in math class wasn’t like, this alarming sign\nI was retreating into a shutdown. I was just a daydreamy girl who cried\nsometimes, which for a lot of my male teachers was probably their feminine\nideal, when you think about it.”\n\nAn Autistic shutdown happens when an Autistic person gets so overstimulated and\nstressed, they can no longer process their surroundings.[51] It’s the quieter,\nmore interior counterpart to an Autistic meltdown, which tends to involve more\ncrying, self-harm, or outward aggression. Shutdowns are essentially a way of\ndissociating from one’s surroundings. It can look like falling asleep very\nsuddenly, becoming unresponsive, or just kind of zoning out (which is how it\npresented in Crystal’s case). Crystal suspects that had she been an Autistic\nboy, her shutdowns would have been viewed differently. Boys are supposed to have\nagency and confidence, and engage actively with the world. Being nonresponsive\nand depressed might have inspired early intervention, rather than morphing into\nan unspeakable family secret. Instead, Crystal’s parents told her to stop being\n“so weird” and to sit up and “look alive.” When confusion and frustration made\nher want to break down and cry, she was similarly told to tamp those urges down.\n\n“Getting smaller and asking for nothing was how I kept people from calling me\ntoo sensitive so often,” she says. “That and assuming that if I was bad at\nsomething, it’s because I was never, ever gonna be good at it. Better to not\nask.”\n\nNow that she knows she’s Autistic, Crystal is trying to unlearn these\ndeep-seated beliefs about herself. She wants to become someone who doesn’t\napologize for crying, and doesn’t always cope with stress by locking herself\naway from the world. She wants to be able to build a life around the fact that a\ntwenty- or thirty-hour workweek is the most she can manage. And she wants to\nrelearn math with a nonjudgmental tutor, who’ll explain things to her in a\ndirect, patient way, without any implied meanings or latent sexism.\n\n“Can I look back one day and say to myself, all the things I hate about myself\nare actually my greatest strengths?” She ponders. “I don’t know. Someone should\nhave always been telling me that. But you try to accept what happened. I can’t\nreally yet. I’m too pissed.”\n\nLike many people who have only recently figured out they’re Autistic, Crystal is\nstill reeling about her newfound identity, and can’t seem to stop thinking about\nhow unfairly she was treated in the past. There’s an entire class of Autistic\npeople who are excluded and alienated in these ways, and we’ll get to meet many\nmore of them in the next few chapters. But first, we need to dive into exactly\nwhy the image of typical Autism is what it is.\n\n\nWHY IS AUTISM SYNONYMOUS WITH WHITE BOYS WHO LOVE TRAINS?\n\nThe Autistic people who wind up needing to mask the most are usually those who\nare undiagnosed due to things like gender, race, or socioeconomic status. These\nsame populations of people also tend to be raised to be more agreeable and\npleasant than their white male peers. For example, developmental psychology\nresearch has repeatedly noted that even small acts of play-aggression in girls\nare severely discouraged and punished by their teachers and parents as\n“inappropriate.” A girl might be admonished for slamming a couple of toys into\none another, for example. Meanwhile, most boys are allowed to be rough and\nsometimes violent in their play.[52] Because girls are held to a much more\nrestrictive social standard than boys are, they learn to hide any troublesome,\n“violent,” or disruptive Autism features much earlier. Similar dynamics are at\nplay for Autistic people of color and trans Autistic people of a variety of\nidentities, as well as other maskers.[53]\n\nFor a long time, Autism researchers believed the condition was truly less severe\nand less common in people of color and girls. Today, some still truly believe\n“female Autism” is less severe, though most professionals recognize that members\nof these marginalized groups are simply not given as much social latitude to be\nstrange or disruptive, and that the same qualities are perceived differently in\na boy than in a girl.[54] However, the legacy of erasing Autistic girls, trans\nand gender-nonconforming Autistics, and other marginalized populations lingers.\n\nThe idea that Autism is a “boy’s” disorder goes all the way back to when the\ncondition was first described at the turn of the twentieth century. Hans\nAsperger and other early Autism researchers did study girls on the spectrum, but\ngenerally left them out of their published research reports.[55] Asperger in\nparticular avoided writing about Autistic girls because he wanted to present\ncertain intelligent, “high-functioning” Autistic people as “valuable” to the\nNazis who had taken over Austria and were beginning to exterminate disabled\npeople en masse. As Steve Silberman describes in his excellent book NeuroTribes,\nHans Asperger wanted to spare the “high functioning” Autistic boys he’d\nencountered from being sent to Nazi death camps. Silberman described this fact\nsomewhat sympathetically; Asperger was a scientist who had no choice but to\ncollude with the fascist regime and save what few children he could. However,\nmore recently unearthed documents make it clear that Asperger was far more\ncomplicit in Nazi exterminations of disabled children than had been previously\nbelieved.[56] Though Asperger held intelligent, “little professor” type\nAutistics close to his heart, he knowingly sent more visibly debilitated\nAutistics to extermination centers.\n\nInformed by eugenicist ideals that only granted rights to those who were\n“valuable” to society, Asperger focused on describing Autism as a disorder for\nintelligent, yet troubled boys, usually ones from wealthy families. Girls with\ndisabilities were seen as more disposable, so they were left out of the\nconversation.[57] Black and brown Autistics weren’t described at all by Asperger\nor most of his contemporaries, even those who were doing research in more\nracially diverse countries such as the United States. The existence of LGBTQ and\ngender nonconforming Autistics was similarly ignored. In fact, the developer of\nthe first therapeutic “treatment” for Autism, Applied Behavioral Analysis\ntherapy, was Ole Ivar Lovaas, who also invented anti-gay conversion therapy.[58]\nThat legacy still haunts the lives of many LGBTQ Autistics, who often feel out\nof place both in mainstream queer spaces and in Autism groups.[59]\n\nSince early published research in both English and German only described\nAutistic boys, some psychiatrists from that era concluded the condition was\ncaused by an “extremely male brain.”[60] Autistic people were supposedly too\nanalytical, too rational, and too individualistic to function in society on\ntheir own. This view influenced how all the diagnostic guidelines were written,\nand created a feedback loop that endured for decades: the Autistics who got\ndiagnosed were primarily wealthy white boys, and those boys continued to set the\nstandard of what Autism was and how it was understood in the studies that\nfollowed.[61] The few white girls who were diagnosed had to be very obviously\n“masculine” in how their Autism presented. Nonwhite Autistics were instead\nidentified as defiant, antisocial, or schizophrenic—all disorders that made it\neasier to incarcerate them, or forcibly place them in institutions.[62]\n\nA century after these trends first began, massive gender- and race-based\ndisparities in Autism diagnoses still exist. For decades, Autistic boys have\noutnumbered girls at a ratio of 4 to 1.[63] Girls like Crystal are still\nroutinely passed over and denied assessments, because they are well-behaved and\ntoo pleasant to “really” be Autistic. Autistic trans people and people of color\nare similarly excluded.[64] When any of us do discover our identities and come\nout, we risk being told we “don’t look Autistic.”\n\nIn media, nearly every Autistic character is a white man with a monotone voice,\nrude demeanor, and a penchant for science. Think of the irascible genius Rick\nfrom Rick and Morty,[65] the hypercompetent yet cold Shaun Murphy from ABC’s The\nGood Doctor, or the nerdy and condescending Sheldon Cooper from The Big Bang\nTheory. In this cultural landscape, there’s little room for Autistics who are\nsensitive, emotionally expressive, artistic, or uninterested in academic\nsuccess. Autism is so broadly associated with assholery that many of us\ninitially hate associating with the term, and try to overcompensate by being\nexcessively easygoing and nonconfrontational. It takes many years of research\nand meeting real-life counter-examples for most of us to recognize Autism isn’t\nthe cold, robotic condition we’ve been told it is.\n\nBeing exposed to these misconceptions and shallow stereotypes can have a\nprofound impact on how Autistic people see ourselves, and which qualities we aim\nto mask.\n\nIn the exercise below, I’d like you to ponder what messages about Autism you\nmight’ve absorbed as a child, and how that may have shaped your self-perceptions\nand your mask. For reasons we’ll get into more thoroughly in the next few\nchapters, an Autistic person’s mask tends to be informed by the Autistic\nqualities they have been trained to hate or fear the most.\n\n\nAUTISM STEREOTYPES:\n\n\nHOW HAVE THEY AFFECTED YOU?\n\n1. Think of some images of Autism that you saw on TV or in movies. If you can,\nname a few Autistic characters or figures you saw during this time.\n\n2. Pick a few Autistic characters (or characters implied to be Autistic) and\ndescribe them in three to five words. For example, I might describe Dustin\nHoffman’s Rain Man as distant, a genius savant, and helpless.\n\nCharacter:_____­_____­_____­__ Traits: _____­_____­_____­_____­___\n\nCharacter:_____­_____­_____­__ Traits: _____­_____­_____­_____­___\n\nCharacter:_____­_____­_____­__ Traits: _____­_____­_____­_____­___\n\n3. Complete the sentence: Before I knew better, I assumed all Autistic people\nwere _______, ________, and _____­_____­.\n\n4. In what ways are you different from these images of Autism?\n\n5. Has anyone ever told you that you “don’t look Autistic” or that you “can’t be\nAutistic”? What do you think they meant by that? How did hearing that feel?\n\nTo download this chart, go to http://prhlink.com/9780593235249a001.\n\nThese days, varied portrayals of Autistic people do exist. Abed Nadir on the\nsitcom Community is a Palestinian Muslim man with a sharp wit and a penchant for\nmovies, as well as the more clichéd chilly demeanor and difficulty smiling. In\nthe popular multiplayer game Overwatch, Symmetra is a confident Autistic Indian\nwoman who blasts her opponents with turrets she’s invented. Beth Harmon of the\nNetflix series The Queen’s Gambit is a beautiful, substance-addicted chess\nplayer, and is heavily implied to be Autistic. I only started seeing characters\nlike these when I was in my late twenties, after I already knew I was Autistic,\nhad met a variety of Autistic people in real life, and began seeking\nrepresentation that went beyond the tortured white genius image. Diversifying\nand deepening my knowledge of what Autism could be was absolutely essential to\nunderstanding myself and slowly beginning to build self-love and acceptance. For\nmany of the masked Autistic people I interviewed for this book, meeting a\nvariety of mold-breaking, “atypical” Autistics of many different backgrounds was\nsimilarly important.\n\n\nSUSPECT YOU’RE AUTISTIC?\n\nMasked Autistic people are basically everywhere, though by our very nature we’re\nsocially invisible. You can find us in any number of fields people might not\nassociate with stereotypically Autistic behavior, including sales, the service\nindustry, and the arts. Because so many of us mask through inhibition and\nwithdrawal, we might not stand out as socially awkward, at least not in a way\nanyone can pinpoint. Though many of us experience sensory issues, anxiety,\nmeltdowns, and debilitating mental health symptoms, we push as much of that\nmisery into the private realm as possible. Our elaborate veils of coping\nmechanisms and camouflaging can create the illusion we don’t need help. Often\nthis comes at the expense of giving up on the areas of life where we might need\nassistance. We may eschew relationships, drop out of grueling academic programs,\navoid working in fields that require networking and socializing, or completely\ndisengage from activities that involve using our bodies, because we feel so\ndetached and uncoordinated in them. Most of us are haunted by the sense there’s\nsomething “wrong” or “missing” in our lives—that we’re sacrificing far more of\nourselves than other people in order to get by and receiving far less in return.\n\nDue to the fact that Autism is so severely underdiagnosed, it’s hard to estimate\njust how prevalent the neurotype really is. We do know that as public awareness\nof Autism has increased, and as diagnosis procedures have gotten a tiny bit less\nbiased, the diagnosis rate has continually gone up. As of 2020, one in 54\nchildren is diagnosed as Autistic, up from one in 68 just four years ago. In the\n1990s only one in every 2,500 children was diagnosed.[66] This upward trend\nshows no sign of stopping, as all evidence suggests the condition is still\nprofoundly underrecognized in women, trans people, Black and brown people,\npeople in poverty, and those without access to screening and therapy. In the\nUnited States, as many as 50 percent of all people who need mental health\nsupport lack access to it,[67] so we are talking about a truly massive\nunderdiagnosis rate.\n\n*Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n\nFrom all this data, we can assume that at least half of all Autistic people in\nthe United States currently fail to get diagnosed. That’s a conservative\nestimate, based on the assumption that every Autistic person with access to\ntherapy gets an accurate diagnosis, a fact we know not to be true. It’s also\nworth bearing in mind that Autism runs in families, and that for every diagnosed\nAutistic child reflected in that chart, there’s probably several other relatives\nwho exhibited Autism spectrum traits. In my own family, almost everyone has some\nAutistic traits and can be considered a part of the Autism community, even if\nsome might not qualify based on an official assessment or might not be\ninterested in identifying as disabled.[68]\n\nIf you’re reading this book, you probably suspect that you or someone you know\nis a masked Autistic, or otherwise neurodiverse. I have been writing about my\nown journey of Autistic self-discovery for many years now, and every single time\nI post online about it, I’m inundated with messages from people who are\nquestioning whether they’re on the spectrum, and want my advice on how to find\nout. Usually, their first question is how to get tested for Autism Spectrum\nDisorder. My initial response to that is to present them with three questions:\n\n 1. Do you have health insurance that covers Autism assessments?\n\n 2. Can you find an Autism assessment specialist in your area who has a proven\n    track record of working successfully with Autistic adults?\n\n 3. What do you hope to get out of a formal diagnosis?\n\nThe first and second questions can prove quite dispiriting to answer. In the\nUnited States, many health insurance plans do not cover Autism assessment in\nadults.[69] A limited number of specialists are qualified to assess and diagnose\nAutism (your average psychologist can’t do it), and the diagnostic process\ntypically involves multiple tests, screening surveys, and even interviews with\nthe Autistic person’s family and friends. Without insurance coverage, this\nprocess can cost anywhere from $1,200[70] to $5,000.[71]\n\nEven when a person can afford to be assessed, identifying a specialist who knows\nhow to diagnose Autistic adults can be prohibitively difficult. My friend Seb\n(who’s in their mid-twenties) sought out an assessment in the UK and was\nsubjected to tests clearly designed for small kids. A therapist asked Seb to\narrange various toys on a table and make up stories about them (this is part of\na common diagnostic tool called the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, or\nthe ADOS, and it was developed for use in children).[72] A questionnaire was\ngiven to Seb’s mother to fill out, and Seb wasn’t permitted to look at what\nshe’d said. They were completely disempowered by the whole process. Some people\nwhom I interviewed for this book reported being turned away by multiple\nassessors, for things as simple as being a woman, dressing well, or having\nvoices that weren’t completely monotonous. Sometimes assessors decide to give\nadults labels they view as less stigmatizing, such as nonverbal learning\ndisorder, rather than identifying them as Autistic explicitly.\n\n“I had to see two specialists,” Crystal tells me. “The first one said basically\nthe same thing my grandpa used to say: girls usually aren’t Autistic. You’re\ndoing fine in life. Don’t worry about it.”\n\nTo this day, a majority of Autism assessment tools are based on the decades-old\nones developed for white male children from wealthy and middle-class\nfamilies.[73] With years of clinical experience, some experts learn to recognize\nAutism in those who mask. They may know, for example, that masked Autistics can\nmake eye contact, though many of us stare too strongly by neurotypical\nstandards, or for too long. They might understand that Autistic women and people\nof color have to appear friendly as a means of survival, so their tone of voice\nmight not be totally flat. Perhaps they’re even aware of Autism’s link with\nsubstance addictions and eating disorders, particularly among people who have to\nfake neurotypicality all day long at their jobs. However, these facts are not a\ncore part of how assessors are trained, and many spend their entire careers\nreinforcing old sexist, white supremacist notions of how the disability looks.\n\nThis brings me to my third question: what do you hope to get out of being\nformally diagnosed? It can come with serious social and legal benefits under the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (and laws in other countries like it), and other\nantidiscrimination statutes worldwide. You might hope that people will take your\nproblems more seriously when a psychiatrist has validated them. A formal\ndiagnosis means you can receive disability accommodations at school or work, and\nyou can pursue a legal case if an employer or landlord shows documentable signs\nof bias against you. In some places a diagnosis can qualify you for a medical\nmarijuana card, or a therapy animal. Family members who have told you that\nyou’re whiny and lazy may finally get off your case when they realize you have a\ndevelopmental disorder. A therapist or medical care provider may tailor their\ntreatment of you to your neurotype. These are the kinds of outcomes many\nneurodivergent people hope for when they pursue formal recognition.\n\nUnfortunately, a diagnosis is not a guarantee you will receive any of these\nbenefits. Proving in a court of law that you’ve been discriminated against as an\nAutistic person requires extensive documentation[74] and is prohibitively\nexpensive to pursue for most disabled people. Even though a diagnosed disability\nentitles you to accommodations on paper, many employers and educators refuse to\nprovide them, or mistreat the employees and students who request them (for more\non the limitations of the ADA and its inconsistent enforcement, see Chapter 8).\nAnd as much as I’d like to promise that being recognized formally as an Autistic\nwill get judgmental friends and family off your back, I’ve heard too many\ncounter-examples to claim that’s really the case. Your family members may find\nyour disability even more threatening once it’s validated by a doctor, or they\nmight use your diagnosis to undermine your judgment or infantilize you. This\nisn’t intended to dissuade you from seeking a diagnosis; I just don’t want\nanyone to have the impression that a piece of paper signed by a psychiatrist\nmagically unlocks a suite of resources and social respect.\n\nAdditionally, an Autism diagnosis does not grant you access to any particular\ntherapy or medication, because there are no evidence-based treatments for Autism\nin adults. Most therapists are not trained to work with Autistic adults, and\nmany of them harbor very shallow, outdated understandings of what the neurotype\nis. Even those who do specialize in Autism are usually trained primarily in\nworking with Autistic kids, “helping” them to behave in a more agreeable,\npassive fashion. Here in Chicago, I’m aware of just one therapist who is\ncompetent in treating Autistic adults who mask, and the only reason I know\nthey’re competent is that other Autistic people have vouched for them to me. I\ndo know several mental health providers in other cities who have confessed to me\nprivately that they are Autistic, and love working with fellow Autistic\npatients. However, each of them has told me they cannot openly identify as\nAutistic professionally. There’s too great a risk that their colleagues would\nview them as incompetent or unprofessional if they were open about their\nneurodivergence.\n\nOf course, even the idea of pursuing a treatment “for” Autism is predicated on\nthe idea we are broken or sick. This is an idea the neurodiversity movement\ncompletely rejects. There is no medication for Autism, no cure for it, and no\nway of changing one’s neurotype. As a community, most Autistics oppose attempts\nto “fix” us. There are some modifications that can be made to existing\ntherapeutic methods, to make them a better fit for Autistic adults, but unless a\nprovider takes the time to self-educate, they may be unaware such modified\ntreatments exist. For the most part, learning you’re Autistic is a journey of\nself-acceptance, community building, and growing self-advocacy, and you might\nnot need or want a diagnosis to go down that path.\n\nFor all the reasons outlined above, I firmly support Autistic\nself-determination. I prefer the terms self-determination or self-realization to\nself-diagnosis, because I believe it’s more sensible to view Autistic identity\nthrough a social lens than a strictly medical one.[75] Diagnosis is a\ngatekeeping process, and it slams its heavy bars in the face of anyone who is\ntoo poor, too busy, too Black, too feminine, too queer, and too gender\nnonconforming, among others. The Autistics who lack access to fair diagnoses\nneed solidarity and justice the most desperately out of all of us, and we can’t\njust shut them out.\n\nThough people like Crystal often regret having not been assessed for Autism at a\nyoung age, Autistic children who are diagnosed when they are young experience\nboth greater access to resources, and more intense, institutionalized stigma.\nBeing identified formally as disabled is very much a double-edged sword; a\ndiagnosis can even be used against you in divorce proceedings or child custody\ncases, or to force a legal adult under a financial conservatorship. This doesn’t\nmean I would recommend against pursuing diagnosis in all cases. I know masked\nAutistic parents who are very glad their Autistic children got assessed and\ndiagnosed when they were young. For many Autistic parents, it’s the diagnosis of\ntheir children that kicks off their own exploration of an Autistic identity.\nHaving a recognized diagnosis of Autism in the family can also ensure that\nprofessionals take your suspicion you’re Autistic more seriously (that certainly\nhas been true in my case).\n\nThe parents I know who have had a positive experience with assessment entered\nthe diagnostic process recognizing they would need to fight many battles to have\ntheir child’s agency and humanity respected. This is true of the adults who have\nsuccessfully pursued formal diagnosis for themselves as well. Unfortunately,\nAutistic people are frequently put in the position of having to educate our own\nhealth care providers. Autistic children in particular need strong advocates in\ntheir corner, fighting to make sure their boundaries are respected and that any\ntreatment they are given is actually in their best interest. If you wish to get\ndiagnosed, or wish for your child to be, you should go into the process with\naccurate expectations, armed with as much information as possible, and ready to\nfight or switch providers multiple times if needed.\n\nIf you don’t wish to brave the long, arduous, and often expensive process of\nbeing assessed, you do not have to. Medical documentation does not make your\nexperience any more real. Self-realized Autistics are not lesser members of the\ncommunity. In most Autistic self-advocacy spaces I frequent, I have no idea who\nis diagnosed and who is not, because it truly does not matter.\n\nI believe that Autistic people have the right to define who we are, and that\nself-definition is a means of reclaiming our power from the medical\nestablishment that has long sought to corral and control us. Our deviance from\nthe norm doesn’t have to be the core part of how we understand ourselves. We can\npush for social norms to be widened, until we reach the point that Autism is\nviewed as a neutral fact about a person’s being, on par with needing glasses or\nhaving freckles. As we make major gains in public awareness and advocacy, we\nwill begin to occupy a less disabled position in society. But we’ll still all be\nAutistic. Accordingly, we shouldn’t let the view of Autism as an impediment\nshape how we see ourselves or determine who belongs among us.\n\n\nA FEW NOTES ON TERMINOLOGY\n\nThroughout this book, I capitalize “Autistic” for the same reason members of the\nDeaf community capitalize “Deaf”—to indicate it is a part of my identity I am\nproud of, and to signal Autistics have our own culture, history, and community.\nSince Eugen Bleuler first coined the word in the early 1900s, Autism has largely\nbeen used in negative and dehumanizing ways, and to this day many parents and\neducators are still deeply frightened by it. By capitalizing Autism, I signal\nthat it’s actually an important, meaningful aspect of who we are, one we don’t\nneed to shy away from.\n\nThroughout, I will also refer to Autism as a disability. Disability is not a bad\nword, because being disabled is not a shameful thing. We are not “differently\nabled”—we are disabled, robbed of empowerment and agency in a world that is not\nbuilt for us. “Differently abled,” “handi-capable,” and similar euphemisms were\ncreated in the 1980s by the abled parents of disabled children, who wished to\nminimize their children’s marginalized status. These terms were popularized\nfurther by politicians[76] who similarly felt uncomfortable acknowledging\ndisabled people’s actual experiences of oppression.[77] These words obscure\nreality and reflect a discomfort many people have with disabled bodies and\nbrains. A person who is completely blind is not “differently sighted”—they lack\nan ability that other people have, in a world that was designed by and for\npeople who can see. The world actively dis-ables people by failing to provide\naccommodations they need. Naming the reality of disability shows respect for\ndisabled people and awareness of how we are oppressed. “Differently abled”\nattempts to erase that behind a cutesy euphemism, and many of us find the term\noffensive.\n\nIn a similar vein, I almost always will use “Autistic” and not “person with\nAutism.” Many non-disabled parents of Autistic kids prefer what’s called “person\nfirst” language rather than “disability first” or “identity first” language.[78]\nDisability service organizations that are not run by disabled people tend to\nadvocate for person first language as well. I also know many clinicians and\nsocial workers who tell me that when they were in school, they were taught to\nalways separate a person’s disability from their identity in this way.\n\nWhen people use person-first language, they often say it’s because they don’t\nwant disabled people to be defined by their disability. However, phrases like\n“person with Autism” distance a person’s disabled status from their humanity in\na way that can be quite harmful. Autism is not a thing that is added on to a\nperson—it’s integral to their life and cannot be removed from who they are. We\ndon’t call Asian people “people with Asianness” and we don’t call gay folks\n“people with homosexuality” because we recognize it is respectful to view these\nidentities as parts of their personhood. Language such as “identifies as\nAutistic” can also come across as dubious. If I really respect a trans woman’s\ngender, for example, I wouldn’t say “this person identifies as a woman.” I’d\nsimply say, “she’s a woman” and leave it at that.\n\nThe vast majority of Autism self-advocates prefer identity-first language and\ndislike euphemisms like “special” and “differently abled,” for all the reasons\nI’ve outlined here. They also discourage describing a person as “high” or “low”\nfunctioning, preferring instead things like “high support needs.” Here’s a table\nsummarizing some of the most common terminology preferences expressed by the\ncommunity:\n\n\nAUTISM TERMINOLOGY:\nCOMMON DOS AND DON’TS\n\n\nUSE THIS\n\n\nAVOID THIS\n\nAutistic person\n\nAutist\n\nAutistic\n\nOn the Autism spectrum\n\nPerson with Autism\n\nIs Autistic\n\nIdentifies as having autism\n\nIs disabled\n\nHas a disability\n\n“Special needs”\n\n“Differently abled”\n\n“Handi-capable”\n\nNeurotypical (NT)\n\nAllistic\n\nNon-Autistic\n\nNormal\n\nHas high support needs\n\nHas low support needs\n\nLow functioning\n\nHigh functioning\n\nMasked Autism\n\nFemale Autism\n\nAsperger’s\n\nHigh-functioning Autism\n\nNonverbal\n\nLoses speech\n\nMute\n\nDumb\n\nIntellectually disabled\n\nDevelopmentally disabled\n\nR*tarded\n\nStupid\n\n“Special”\n\nDirect language about what a person can or can’t do, and what kind of support\nthey need\n\nEuphemisms, language that minimizes challenges, language that belittles or\ncondescends\n\nAutistics are a diverse group, though, and we don’t all have to agree on which\nterms we like and dislike having used for ourselves. If you are Autistic, you\nget to decide what language works best for you. Some people prefer to say they\nare “on the spectrum,” for example, rather than strictly Autistic. Others\nidentify as having Asperger’s, though that disorder label no longer exists, and\nwas rooted in Hans Asperger’s eugenicist research.[79] I recognize that people\nwho had that term forced on them in the past may feel an attachment to it, or a\ndesire to reclaim it. The word bisexual was once a mental illness label,[80] but\nwe don’t tell bisexual people they can’t use it because of its offensive\nhistory. When someone like folklorist Anand Prahlad writes a book like The\nSecret Life of a Black Aspie, it’s clear his use of the term “Aspergers” is not\nintended to reinforce old, white supremacist notions of what the disability is.\nI find it’s far more important to question the belief that supposedly “higher\nfunctioning” Autistic lives matter more than others than it is to scrub all\npeople’s language of outdated or problematic terms. Additionally, it is vital\nthat the disability self-advocacy community remain accessible to all people of\nall ability levels. That requires we extend grace and understanding to people\nwho don’t communicate exactly the way we might like them to.\n\nThough most of the community discourages the use of such terms, some Autistic\npeople do identify as “low functioning” or “severely Autistic.” Functioning\nlabels oversimplify the Autistic experience, and they do serve to imply that we\nshould be defined by how productive and independent we are. That’s a big\nproblem. At the same time, function labels can occasionally be used to highlight\nthe fact that those of us who can talk, dress ourselves, or hide our meltdowns\nhave social privileges other Autistic people do not have. I don’t function\n“highly” in every single realm of my life, but I am able to get by more easily\nthan many other Autistics. My acceptance in society is conditional on my\nbehaving respectably and being productive. That’s really a deeply ableist\nreality, but I shouldn’t pretend it isn’t true. Though having to mask as a\ndesirable, respectable person can be very soul-crushing, it does protect me from\nphysical violence, institutionalization, poverty, and loneliness. I can\nunderstand why my friend Angel believes it’s worth pointing out that his life as\na nonspeaking person with intellectual disabilities is really different from\nmine. Angel says he is low functioning, and says that he has severe Autism;\nthough some in our community find that offensive, I stand by his right to name\nhis own experience.\n\nI love that every Autistic person has their own unique relationship to these\nlabels, and their own thoughts. Our disagreements show that the Autistic\ncommunity is diverse, filled with people who form their own opinions and speak\ntheir minds. We’re not a monolithic group, and our individual journeys shape how\nwe express our identities to the world. I’ve done my best in this book to honor\nthe terminology each individual Autistic person uses for themselves. This means\nthat sometimes I’ll call someone a “person with Autism” or a “low-functioning”\nperson, even though self-advocacy groups have good reasons to discourage\nallistics from using such words thoughtlessly. If someone self-identifies as an\nAspie or as having Asperger’s, I’ll accurately reflect that as well. I hope that\neven if you have specific stances on which terms you like and dislike, you can\nrespect my interview subjects’ agency to name themselves, as I have strived to\ndo."},{"title":"Test Section Title","content":"CHAPTER 2\n\n\nWHO ARE THE MASKED AUTISTICS?\n\nBobbi, an Autistic nonbinary person in their mid-thirties, says, “I wasn’t\nraised or ‘socialized’ as an Autistic girl. I was raised as a weird kid, and a\ngender failure.”\n\nBobbi says that as a child, they were interested in sports, local plants and\nmushrooms, and pro wrestling. They were considered “tomboyish,” and were\nsocially ostracized from their peers because they were awkward and rude, and\nrefused to behave in “ladylike” ways. Even when Bobbi tried to conform to gender\nnorms, they failed spectacularly. They lacked the fine motor control to do\nmakeup or write in pretty cursive letters. When girls subtly bullied them in the\nlunchroom for their short, self-chopped haircut, Bobbi couldn’t understand what\nwas happening. They assumed that when girls yelled, “Hey Bobbi, nice haircut,”\nthey were being sincere.\n\nNo one flagged Bobbi as potentially Autistic, and they certainly didn’t\nrecognize Bobbi as potentially transgender, either.\n\n“I was just in this category of ‘weird annoying kid’ off to the side,” they tell\nme.\n\nIn both respects, it was easy for adults to write off Bobbi’s struggles as a\nmere annoyance, rather than a sign Bobbi was marginalized both in terms of\ngender and disability status. Masked Autism and being a closeted gender minority\noften go hand in hand, and the experiences share a lot of features. The baffled\nfamilies of transgender people and adult Autistics alike tend to claim there\n“were no signs” of these identities when the person was young.[1] In actuality,\nthere were often many signs, which the child’s family either did not know to\nlook for, or didn’t wish to see.[2] Signs of nonconformity were likely met with\nadmonishment, “helpful” condescending corrections (“you look so unhappy, please\nsmile!”), or by freezing the child out until they conformed. Bobbi was\nsarcastically complimented quite often, not just for their hair, but for how\nthey carried themselves, spoke, thought, and for the comfortable, practical ways\nthat they dressed. As they grew older, they began to figure out what was\nexpected of them, and shifted their gender presentation to be more feminine so\nthey could be seen as fully human.\n\nNo one in young Bobbi’s life could see them as they truly were. When your belief\nsystem teaches that disability and gender variance are embarrassing and\ndisgusting, it’s hard to look at your child and recognize those traits. It\ncertainly didn’t help that in movies and television programs in the 1980s and\n1990s, Autistic people were all silent, passive nonentities, and transgender\npeople were perverted serial killers or trashy daytime TV curiosities.\n\nThese days, Bobbi surrounds themselves with fellow Autistic and transgender\npeople. They first discovered their disability after their eldest son was\nassessed in elementary school, and in the couple of years since then they’ve\ntried to build relationships that help them feel normal and seen for the first\ntime. They described their friend group to me as a land of misfit toys. They’re\nall people who’d been shut out of mainstream society, most of them in multiple\nways. Even the public conversation about Autism ignores their existence much of\nthe time.\n\n“We have to make society over again from the ground up,” they say. “Our own\nlittle neuro-queer microsocieties. Because no one else will think to include\nus.”\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nIn this chapter, I’d like to introduce you to the groups of people who most\ncommonly become masked Autistics. These are the people who have been\nsystematically denied access to diagnosis for decades, and are frequently still\nignored in public and psychiatric conversations about neurodivergence. They’re\nAutistic women like Crystal, Autistic trans people like Bobbi, and Black\ngenderqueer people like Anand Prahlad. Some had their neurodivergence erased\nbecause they grew up in poverty, or because they had physical ailments that\nobscured their Autistic traits. Some are assumed to be too “high functioning” to\nneed accommodations, but actually suffer deeply from a lack of accessibility and\nsupport. Others are pretty clearly debilitated by disability but were\nmisdiagnosed as Borderline or Narcissistic instead of Autistic. In their\nstories, you’ll see just how multifaceted the Autistic community is, and how\npainfully limiting stereotypes about the disability really are to each of us.\nYou may also see yourself reflected in these stories or recognize someone you\nknow. The more Autism is understood and embraced in its full, rich diversity,\nthe less need there will be for these multiply marginalized Autistic people to\nkeep themselves hidden behind a mask of quiet conformity.\n\n\nAUTISTIC WOMEN AND GENDER MINORITIES\n\nMost of the writing and research about gender-based disparities in Autism\nfocuses on the fact that girls are woefully underdiagnosed. Researchers,\ntherapists, and even some Autistic self-advocates talk about “female Autism,”[3]\npointing to the fact that among girls, Autistic qualities do seem less severe or\nobvious on average.\n\nWhen Autistic girls engage in self-stimulatory behavior, it tends to be less\nphysically damaging: less arm biting, more hair twirling or opening and closing\na book quietly many times.[4] When Autistic girls are shy and withdrawn, people\nare less concerned by it than they would be if a boy exhibited the same\nreticence. On the flip side, when Autistic girls have meltdowns, it tends to get\nwritten off as an emotional outburst. When they do act out or behave\naggressively, they’re more likely to be punished severely for not being\nladylike, resulting in them learning to censor their aggression at an earlier\nage than most boys do.[5] Adults speak to young girls using more emotion-related\nwords than they do when speaking to boys,[6] which means Autistic girls often\nget a leg up in social and relational skills. Much of the play that girls\nstereotypically engage in (and are encouraged to engage in) involves mimicking\nadult social interactions, such as playing house or pretending to run a\nstore.[7] As a result many Autistic girls learn how to fake their way through\nroutine conversations at a younger age than boys do.\n\nFor these and a variety of other reasons, Autistic girls are assessed and\ndiagnosed at older ages.[8] Many are diagnosed as adults, or are never diagnosed\nat all. Like Crystal, many Autistic women develop an inoffensive, quiet\npersonality as a crutch to counterbalance their social disadvantages.\nUnfortunately, adopting a docile persona makes it even harder for their\nsuffering to be seen as a real problem.\n\nBelow is a table summarizing some of the most well-known “female Autism” traits.\nIt’s adapted from a list originally published on the now-defunct site\nHelp4Asperger’s, which was maintained by the author of the book Aspergirls, Rudy\nSimone.[9] This is by no means an exhaustive list, and shouldn’t be taken as a\ndiagnostic tool. As I’ve already mentioned, the idea that all women have “female\nAutism” is a reductive one. Still, clinicians often fall back on tables like\nthese to determine if an adult woman might potentially be an undiagnosed\nAutistic, so it’s something to be cognizant of. If someone is aware that a\nphenomenon such as “female Autism” exists, they’re often taught it looks\nsomething like this:\n\n\nTRAITS COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH “FEMALE AUTISM”[10]\n\n\nEMOTIONAL\n\n * Strikes others as emotionally immature and sensitive.\n\n * Prone to outbursts or crying jags, sometimes over seemingly small things.\n\n * Has trouble recognizing or naming one’s feelings.\n\n * Ignores or suppresses emotions until they “bubble up” and explode.\n\n * May become disturbed or overwhelmed when others are upset, but uncertain how\n   to respond or support them.\n\n * Goes “blank” and seems to shut down after prolonged socializing or when\n   overstimulated.\n\n\nPSYCHOLOGICAL\n\n * Reports a high degree of anxiety, especially social anxiety.\n\n * Is perceived by others as moody and prone to bouts of depression.\n\n * May have been diagnosed with mood disorders such as Bipolar Disorder, or\n   personality disorders such as Borderline or Narcissistic Personality\n   Disorder, before Autism was discovered.\n\n * Fears rejection intensely and tries to manage how other people feel to avoid\n   it.\n\n * Has an unstable sense of self, perhaps highly dependent on the opinions of\n   others.\n\n\nBEHAVIORAL\n\n * Uses control to manage stress: follows intense self-imposed rules, despite\n   having an otherwise unconventional personality.\n\n * Is usually happiest at home or in a familiar, predictable environment.\n\n * Seems youthful for their age, in looks, dress, behavior, or interests.\n\n * Prone to excessive exercise, calorie restriction, or other eating disordered\n   behaviors.\n\n * Neglects physical health until it becomes impossible to ignore.\n\n * Self-soothes by constantly fidgeting, listening to repetitive music, twirling\n   hair, picking at skin or cuticles, etc.\n\n\nSOCIAL\n\n * Is a social chameleon; adopts the mannerisms and interests of the groups\n   they’re in.\n\n * May be highly self-educated but will have struggled with social aspects of\n   college or their career.\n\n * Can be very shy or mute, yet can become very outspoken when discussing a\n   subject they are passionate about.\n\n * Struggles to know when to speak when in large groups or at parties.\n\n * Does not initiate conversations but can appear outgoing and comfortable when\n   approached.\n\n * Can socialize, but primarily in shallow, superficial ways that may seem like\n   a performance. Struggles to form deeper friendships.\n\n * Has trouble disappointing or disagreeing with someone during a real-time\n   conversation.\n\nIn this list of traits, I do recognize elements of myself and many\nadult-diagnosed Autistics I know of all genders. There’s a particular way the\nneurotype tends to present among people who only discovered the identity late in\nlife. We tend to be emotionally withdrawn yet friendly and socially adaptive.\nWe’re social chameleons, and masters at making people like us, but we never let\nmuch of our real selves show. We erect rigid rules around our lives to manage\nstress and make an unpredictable social world feel a little less scary: make eye\ncontact for this many seconds, eat this easy-to-prepare meal at this time of\nday, never talk about yourself for too long. Try as we might to be agreeable,\npeople still comment on how “oversensitive” or “immature” we are, or imply we’re\nhard to read. When we struggle, people talk down to us, or try to socially\n“mother” us into more normative behavior.\n\nLists like these are still pretty popular among therapists[11] and in online\nspaces for Autistic people and our families.[12] Sometimes therapists who are\nseeking to educate themselves on “female Autism” will encounter this list online\nand let it inform their views, or pass it along to their patients. It offers a\nvery broad, very gendered list of traits that reflect a lot of cultural biases\nand assumptions. What does it mean, for example, to “seem youthful”? Would a\nlarge, hairy man who loves collecting Funkopop toys but also enjoys MMA fighting\nbe considered youthful? Or would that label instead apply to a petite woman who\nwears dresses and speaks in a high-pitched voice about her love of horses? All\ntoo often, the difference between who gets perceived as an innocent, shy\nAutistic and who gets viewed as creepy, awkward, and obviously disabled is more\na function of things like race, gender, and body size than it is any innate\ndifference in personality or behavior. There is no objective definition of what\nmakes someone moody or a social chameleon, either. It’s easier to socially\ncamouflage if you’re the kind of person society doesn’t view with much suspicion\nin the first place.\n\nThis cluster of traits is commonly called “female Autism,” but that label\nignores the fact that a large percentage of Autistic people are transgender and\ngender nonconforming.[13] I’m transgender and Autistic, and find that my\nexperiences don’t fully slide into either the “female” or “male” Autism\nnarratives. I’ve always had some male Autistic traits, like a tendency to be\ndidactic and speak in a confident monotone, yet I was also a “sensitive,”\n“immature” kid who played imaginary games with toys into my teens. Calling any\nof these qualities signs of “male Autism” versus “female Autism” is as gender\nreductive as saying there’s an innately “masculine” or “feminine” personality\ntype.\n\nLike Bobbi, I was raised and socialized as a bit of an odd freak more than I was\na “boy” or a “girl.” Neither girls nor boys related to me as one of their own,\nand I didn’t identify with them, either. I felt more like a mystical fairy\ncreature dropped into the wrong reality than I felt like a “female,” or even a\nhuman being. I played Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and recognized myself for\nthe first time in the game’s wordless, androgynous protagonist Link. He didn’t\nspeak, and didn’t belong in the community of childlike elves he’d been raised\nin. His difference was what marked him as special and destined to save the\nworld. Link was brave, strong, and softly pretty, all at the same time. He was\nclueless and ineffectual in most social situations, but that didn’t keep him\nfrom doing important things or from being met with gratitude and affection\neverywhere he went. I loved absolutely everything about Link, and modeled my own\nstyle after him for many years. I wore tunic-style dresses and kept my hair long\nand blond, which read as “feminine” enough to other people that they rewarded me\nfor correctly playing the role of an attractive girl. But in actuality, it was a\nsneaky way to cosplay as my favorite male video game character every day without\nconsequence. On family camping trips that were uncomfortably bug-ridden, hot,\nand socially overwhelming, I wandered the woods, pretending I was Link on an\nadventure across Hyrule. I desperately needed a model of how to be comfortable\nin my own skin, and Link was there when nothing else was available.\n\nThis is actually a really common Autistic experience. Perhaps because so many of\nus are alienated from mainstream neurotypical life, we come to identify with\nfantasy creatures,[14] aliens, robots,[15] or animals instead of the people\naround us.[16] Our hyperliteral, analytic minds recognize that the rules of the\ngender binary are arbitrary and entirely made up,[17] so making up our own\ngender identities and rules of presentation seems like fair game. Identifying\noutside of the binary (and outside of humanity) also helps many of us put a name\nto how detached we feel from society, and from our bodies. Of course it’s hard\nfor me to carry myself in a “ladylike” way, I’m a robot in a human suit! There’s\na term for Autistic trans people who see their neurotype and gender identity as\ninextricably linked: autigender.[18]\n\nI asked Bobbi if they see their Autism and transness as being associated, and\nthey tell me, “Absolutely, yes, you can’t have one part of me without having the\nother. My Autism is trans and my transness is Autistic. Bras were uncomfortable\nfor gender reasons and because I can’t deal with tight clothes. I did soccer and\nflag football to be ‘one of the guys,’ and because when I was running around,\nnobody could talk to me or ask me questions that were social traps. It’s all\nwrapped up together.”\n\nI feel the exact same way as Bobbi. I love that my Autism and my transness are\nlinked. On good days, I love being Autistic and see it as a natural, neutral\npart of my identity, so it never has struck me as a problem that it’s shaped my\ngender. I’m not a “normal” person, have never been able to be one, so\nidentifying outside of the gender binary as well as mainstream humanity feels\nlike home.\n\nSadly, many “gender critical” parents and mental health professionals don’t see\nit that way. Transphobic people often take the strong association between gender\nvariance and Autism as a sign that we aren’t “really” trans, we’re “just”\nAutistic and confused.[19] They presume Autistic people are un-self-aware and\neasily manipulated, and therefore shouldn’t be allowed to make decisions about\nour identities or what we do with our bodies.[20] When Harry Potter author J. K.\nRowling published the piece “TERF (trans exclusionary radical feminist) Wars” on\nher blog in the summer of 2020, she specifically mentioned her fear that many\ntransgender men are actually Autistic girls who weren’t conventionally feminine,\nand have been influenced by transactivists on the internet into identifying out\nof womanhood.[21] In presenting herself as defending disabled “girls,” she\nargued for restricting young trans Autistic people’s ability to self-identify,\nand access necessary services and health care.\n\nRowling’s perspective (which she shares with many gender critical folks) is\ndeeply dehumanizing to both the trans and Autistic communities. We’re fully\nfledged, complex people, who are entitled to the same body autonomy and\nself-determination as anyone else. And it’s meaningless to question whether a\ntrans Autistic person would have “still” been trans had they not been born\nneurodiverse, because Autism is such a core part of who we are. Without our\ndisability (or our gender identity) we’d be entirely different people. There is\nno separating these aspects of ourselves from our personhood or personality.\nThey’re both core parts.\n\nLaura Kate Dale is a transgender woman, video game critic, and author who has\nwritten extensively about how her neurotype and gender have run parallel\nthroughout her life. In her memoir, Uncomfortable Labels: My Life as a Gay\nAutistic Trans Woman, she writes that though she was viewed as a boy when she\nwas growing up, she didn’t have the traditional “cis boy with Autism”\nexperience.[22] She had many recognizably Autistic traits, such as an aversion\nto bright colors and strong flavors, and a detachment from physical reality that\nmade it impossible to figure out what clothes to wear for any given day’s\nweather. Yet when she was evaluated for a variety of disabilities as a kid,\ncounselors didn’t consider Autism. Society had deemed her a “boy,” and “boys”\nwith Autism weren’t supposed to be so docile and sweet. She had many of the\nfeatures of “female Autism,” though the world did not yet recognize her as a\nfemale.\n\nLaura writes, “You see, there are stereotypes about children assigned male at\nbirth, and very few of them applied to me growing up. There’s an expectation of\nbrashness, over excitability, loudness and emotional closure…. I was a quiet,\nreserved child who was sweet and did what they were told and was always in the\nright place, at the right time, doing what was expected.”[23]\n\nLaura’s interests were often very feminine, rather than boyish. Like Crystal,\nshe didn’t disturb class with meltdowns or hurt anybody’s feelings by being\nblunt or rude. Since her internal suffering didn’t pose any problems to her\nclassmates or teachers, it flew under the radar, unremarked upon—which is\nexactly what happens to many cisgender Autistic girls. Even some of her Autistic\ntraits got chalked up to her being a weird or effeminate kid, rather than a\ndisabled one.\n\nLaura’s and Bobbi’s experiences are perfect examples of why the term “female\nAutism” is misleading; it presents the root of masking as being a person’s\nassigned sex at birth, or their identity, when really it’s social expectations\nthat lead to a person’s disability getting ignored. Masking is a social\nexperience, not a biological one. “Female Autism” isn’t actually a subtype of\nthe disorder; it’s a way that people cope with their neurodiversity not being\ntaken seriously. Often, it is women who are in that position. But many other\nmarginalized groups go through it, too, and those trends have not been as widely\nrecognized. Black and brown Autistics in particular are underdiagnosed at high\nrates, just as women are, because racism has similarly distorted how the\ndisorder gets perceived and assessed. They also pay a huge price for being\nnonconforming and noncompliant, and are thus expected to mask as a means of\nsurvival.\n\n\nBLACK AND BROWN AUTISTICS\n\nRacism has permeated psychology and psychiatry from its genesis. Early\nclinicians came from white, European backgrounds, and used their culture’s\nsocial norms as the basis for what being healthy looked like.[24] It was a very\nnarrow and oppressive definition, which assumed that being genteel, well\ndressed, well-read, and white were the marks of humanity, and that anyone who\ndeviated from that standard was not a person, but an animal in need of being\ntamed.[25]\n\nThe modern concept of mental illness as a medical condition first formed during\nthe Victorian period in England, a time and place where restraint and dignity\nwas equated with sanity.[26] Even poor English people who couldn’t maintain the\npolished appearance and icy etiquette of the wealthy were considered to be\nsomewhat savage and sick. Cultures that were more emotionally expressive or less\nfiltered were pathologized as irrational, oversexualized, and aggressive. The\nmental health needs of white, wealthy people (and the hassle rich mentally ill\npeople presented to their high-status families) were the primary concern of\nearly psychiatrists. Everyone else was, at best, an afterthought, and at worse\nan undesirable to be purged.\n\nThis history shaped how professionals saw and defined Autism from the very\nstart, and its legacy is still with us today. Autistic people of color\nfrequently end up having their Autism ignored due to racism and bigotry.[27]\nThey’re less likely to get referrals to Autism specialists.[28] They have an\nincredibly hard time finding culturally competent health care.[29] Only about 4\npercent of all mental health providers in the United States are Black,[30]\nthough Black people make up 13.4 percent of the country’s overall population.\nWhen Black and brown Autistic people see white therapists, normal expressions of\nemotions like anger may be misperceived as excessive or “threatening,” and\nmisdiagnoses are very common.[31] That’s if they get identified as having a\nmental health condition at all. Black Autistics are frequently obligated to mask\ntheir traits and any negative mental health symptoms because (like girls and\ngender minorities) society demands they be more obedient and agreeable than\nwhite boys are.\n\nComedian Chris Rock recently came out about being on the Autism spectrum;\nspecifically, he was diagnosed with Nonverbal Learning Disorder. In an interview\nwith The Hollywood Reporter, he describes how clear-cut indicators (such as an\ninability to pick up on social cues and a tendency to take all statements\nhyperliterally) were ignored until his mid-fifties. Because he was an outgoing,\nBlack comedian, Autism seemed unthinkable as an explanation for the social and\nemotional challenges he was facing.[32] Rock says he downplayed his own mental\nhealth needs, too, because he’d internalized the idea only white people go to\ntherapy.\n\nThis is a systemic and far-reaching problem. White Autistics are 19 percent more\nlikely to be diagnosed than Black Autistics are, and 65 percent more likely to\nbe diagnosed than Latinx Autistics.[33] Black and Latinx Autistic people also\nget their diagnoses at older ages, reflecting their delayed access to\nservices.[34] Indigenous Autistics are underdiagnosed and delayed in their\ndiagnoses at even more extreme rates.[35]\n\nThese long-standing racial and cultural gaps persist for a variety of reasons.\nThe lower a family’s socioeconomic status, the less likely they are to have\naccess to health care of any kind, but particularly Autism testing, which is\nseldom covered by insurance and can cost thousands of dollars. Additionally,\nracism influences how teachers and specialists perceive and screen for Autistic\ntraits in Black and brown kids. When a white kid doesn’t listen to instructions\nand hurls blocks across the room, he might be gently chastised, or soothed. When\na Black or brown kid does the exact same thing, he’s “corrected” far more\naggressively. He might even be treated as a future criminal in the making.[36]\n\nThe writer Catina Burkett is a Black Autistic woman, and she is acutely aware of\nhow people’s perceptions of her disability are mediated by misogynoir, the\nsystemic oppression of Black women.[37]\n\n“Many people with autism can also appear obstinate or are slow to react in new\nsituations,” Catina writes. “When I am inflexible, I am sometimes called\nunfriendly, insubordinate, lazy, aggressive or uncontrollable.”\n\nI’ve known quite a few white Autistic men who are, as Catina puts it, obstinate\nat work. If the white guy in question has an advanced degree or a desirable\nskill set, such as the ability to code, being a bit difficult to deal with\ndoesn’t necessarily get in his way. In fact, for some Autistic men in tech,\nbeing a bit arrogant or cold can work to their advantage. Their aloofness\nsignals they must be a tortured genius, a Sherlock in an office of Watsons. Yet\nwhen a Black Autistic woman is even slightly flat in her emotional expressions,\nshe has to worry people will call her “angry” or “unprofessional.”\n\n“One white female supervisor complained that I should learn to change my\ndemeanor with different people,” writes Catina. “[She] grew bitter and the work\nenvironment became hostile. Eventually, I had to quit.”\n\nCatina’s boss was, in essence, asking her to code switch, and put on different\nlinguistic and social presentations for different situations. Many Black\nAmericans are conversant in code switching, having to shift between\nAfrican-American English (or AAE)[38] and Standard English as they move between\ncommunities, and modulating their appearance, mannerisms, and volume to avoid\nbeing negatively stereotyped.[39] Code switching is similar to Autism masking in\nthe sense that it’s an effortful process of signaling you “belong” in a space,\nand of knowing when to hide the sides of yourself that the majority will be\noppressive toward. Code switching is a cognitively demanding activity that can\nhinder a person’s performance on challenging or demanding tasks,[40] and it is\nassociated with psychological stress and feeling inauthentic and socially\nisolated.[41] A report in Harvard Business Review found that many Black code\nswitchers described it as a state of hypervigilance, and that they needed to\nconstantly police their actions and speech in order to minimize white discomfort\nor hostility.[42]\n\nBlack Autistic people can have a variety of complicated relationships to masking\nand code switching. Pretending to be neurotypical by one culture’s rules is\nwearying enough. Having to do it in a variety of different ways, using different\ndialects and mannerisms depending on the setting, is an entirely different level\nof social performance. Autistic researcher and organizer Timotheus Gordon Jr.\ntold me that learning to code switch in his speaking style actually led to him\nbecoming more socially ostracized as an Autistic child, not less.\n\n“Because I’m African American, I have a different English to speak,” he says,\n“which is African-American English. So I was placed into speech therapy, in my\nopinion, to sound like a person who speaks the standard American English.”\n\nIn speech therapy, Timotheus was trained to communicate more like a white,\nmiddle-class person would; in essence, he was being told to mask his culture.\nBut since he went to a majority Black school, this didn’t help him fit in, it\nmarked him as different.\n\n“I went to school with mostly African Americans, or folks of African descent. It\nbackfired because I was mocked for speaking differently, or speaking like I’m\nfrom England.”\n\nOver time, Timotheus had to learn to mask his speaking style in order to fit in\nwith his peers, but also to shift back into so-called standard American English\nwhen interacting with white people and institutions. Psychological research\nshows that code switching requires a ton of cognitive resources even for\nneurotypical people.[43] One masked Autistic woman I spoke to, Mariah, told me\nthat for many years she thought code switching exhausted her. Eventually,\nthough, she discovered that it was the masking as neurotypical that was wearing\nher out. For some Black Autistics like Catina, it can be prohibitively hard to\nmanage both tasks. Since she couldn’t will herself to transform into a cheery,\nenthusiastic personality at will, her boss viewed her as hard to work with.\n\nFor Autistic people of color, being seen as hostile or difficult can become\ndownright dangerous. When Black and brown Autistics fail to comply with medical\ninstructions or the directions of therapists, they’re frequently\ninstitutionalized and stripped of legal autonomy.[44] They also have to worry\nabout incarceration or death at the hands of police. In 2017, Chicago police\nsergeant Khalil Muhammad shot an unarmed, Black Autistic teenager named Ricardo\nHayes. Muhammad claimed he felt threatened by Hayes, but an investigation\nrevealed Hayes had been harmlessly jogging along the side of his street, and\ndidn’t show any aggression toward Muhammad.[45] Five days after the murder of\nGeorge Floyd, an Israeli police officer in Jerusalem City shot and killed Eyad\nHallaq, an Autistic Palestinian man who was profoundly intellectually disabled\nand unable to speak or comprehend instructions.[46] In April 2021, a Chicago\npolice officer shot and killed thirteen-year-old Adam Toledo, who had his hands\nin the air. Adam was in special education and neurodivergent.[47] Approximately\n50 percent of people who are killed by police have disabilities,[48] and Black\nand brown Autistics are at an especially elevated risk.[49] Being identified as\nAutistic can be socially and emotionally perilous for women and gender\nminorities, regardless of race; for Black and brown Autistics, being visibly\ndisabled can be deadly.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nIn The Secret Life of a Black Aspie, folklorist Anand Prahlad illustrates in\nlush detail how it felt to mask his Autism and present a neurotypical,\nnonthreatening façade to the world:\n\n“I learned to grow masks for school. I had to be careful there. Covering up was\nlike an instinct, though. Like a brown walking stick turning green when it sits\non a leaf. Watch…Watch hands. Watch lips. Watch eyebrows.”[50]\n\nAnand grew up on a plantation in the 1950s, just two generations from the end of\nslavery. Living in a rural area with his family (many of whom had Autistic\ntraits), Anand found comfort in nature. Upon entering the school system, though,\nhe had to mask up. In addition to being Black and Autistic, Anand is also\ngenderqueer, so as soon as he was thrust into public school, he had to begin\nhiding his neurodivergence as well as his soft, feminine side.\n\nThroughout the book, Anand describes how various social settings demanded\ndifferent versions of him. There was the all-Black elementary school where he\nwas seen as odd, and not sufficiently masculine, but mostly left alone; there\nwas the integrated high school where white people placed a great deal of\npressure on him to be a respectable vanguard for racial justice. As an adult,\nAnand became a professor. In the academy, he was required to hide all emotional\nvulnerability, censor all casual language and slang, and obscure anything else\nwhite colleagues would deem “unprofessional.” Autistic people are usually pretty\ncandid, and Black American culture tends to also value direct “real talk” about\ninterpersonal issues.[51] But in majority-white, abled institutions, openly\nsaying what you mean or complaining about anything scares people. Anand had to\nadapt to hide the parts of himself that were open, vulnerable, and real.[52]\n\nThroughout his memoir, Anand describes how erecting false selves was necessary,\nbut also made it impossible to genuinely connect with others. It’s an experience\nI know that many masked Autistics can relate to. We have to keep other people at\narm’s length, because letting them see our hyperfixations, meltdowns,\nobsessions, and outbursts could mean losing their respect. But locking ourselves\naway means we can’t ever be fully loved.\n\n“I would never have survived following neurotypical rules,” Anand writes. “But\nmy rules weren’t necessarily the best ones to follow in a relationship. For\nexample, my rules said disconnect the minute I’m overwhelmed. Stop\nlistening…Keep my secrets.”\n\nAnand went through several breakups and multiple divorces before finally getting\ndiagnosed as Autistic. Instead of sharing his feelings with his partners, he’d\nrun away, either physically or into the recesses of his mind. When his third\nwife suggested this might be caused by a disability, Anand finally was put on a\npath toward self-acceptance.\n\nMasking is a sensible survival strategy when you have no other tools at your\ndisposal. But the more you deviate from what society values, the more elaborate\nyour masking must be. Hiding your Autism, your cultural Blackness, and your\nqueerness or womanhood can be too much. Sometimes the only viable alternative is\nto shut down and become deeply inhibited. You can’t offend anyone if you simply\nmelt into the wallpaper.\n\nCatina Burkett and Anand Prahlad both describe adopting this strategy, becoming\nquiet and repressed, keeping their heads down to avoid evoking white people’s\nfear of confident Black personhood. Other Black Autistics get by in life the way\nChris Rock has, working to come across as cheery, funny, and immensely likable.\nJust as many Autistic women and trans people adapt by becoming nonthreatening\nand small, Black Autistics frequently have to self-preserve by plastering on a\nsmile.\n\n\nHIGHLY VERBAL AND OUTGOING AUTISTICS\n\nIn 1911, the psychiatrist Eugene Bleuler coined the term autism.[53] It\nliterally means “isolated self.” This is in contrast to the term for\nnon-Autistic, allistic, which means other-self or connected-self.[54] Countless\ndepictions of Autism on TV and in film focus on how alienated and in our own\nheads we supposedly are. Think of the Autistic boy in the series finale of St.\nElsewhere, who is famously revealed to have dreamed up the entire show and all\nits characters while sitting off by himself, staring into a snow globe.[55] A\nmore contemporary example is the titular character in Sia’s widely panned[56]\nfilm Music, a nonverbal Autistic girl who barely seems to notice when her own\ngrandmother dies right in front of her. In the film, Music can’t speak, and can\nbarely use the augmented communication device she’s been given, and only\nconnects with other characters through elaborately choreographed dream\nsequences.[57] She’s an isolated, antisocial self, locked away in a world of her\nown making.\n\nThough a majority of diagnosed Autistics report having introverted personality\ntraits,[58] some of us are actually quite extroverted and outgoing.[59]\nExperimental research suggests that some of the social skills deficits\nassociated with Autism (for example, difficulty recognizing faces) are reduced\namong Autistics who are extroverted.[60] If you seek out a lot of social\ncontact, you’ll get more practice interacting with people, so it makes sense\nthat extroverted Autistics gradually learn to more easily blend in. Extroverted\nAutistics also tend to have larger, more expressive emotions than their\nintroverted peers, which can make them easier for neurotypicals to relate to.\n\nAutistics can have intense and bright personalities just as easily as we can\nseem icy and withdrawn. Many can make strong eye contact, listen actively, and\njump in excitedly when someone brings up a topic that interests us. Outgoing\nAutistics may fumble with social niceties, interrupt too often, seem “too\nenthusiastic,” or even be accused of histrionics, but a high degree of interest\nin connecting with others does generally benefit them psychologically and\nsocially.[61]\n\nUnfortunately, because Autism is so singularly portrayed as a disorder that\nmakes you cold and robotic, outgoing Autistics are seldom correctly identified\nand diagnosed as kids. Teachers and parents think of them as chatty social\nbutterflies, or disruptive class clowns. People may even come to view their\nlarge emotional displays and bursts of energy as “manipulative” or “attention\nseeking.” Over time these labels can become a part of the mask they wear to get\nby. It can also make it difficult for an Autistic person to have their need for\nalone time or other social boundaries respected. For example, Timotheus told me\nthat since he can come across as an affable “life of the party” type, it can be\nhard for his friends and family to understand that he sometimes also needs to\nrecharge alone.\n\n“My grandparents originally came from the deep South, so in that cultural sense\nit was important nobody gets left out,” he explains. “If you feel sad, then it’s\nbest to be in a group. But in my case, I need to be left alone. But if I say to\npeers or even family members, I need my alone time, they say no no no, you can’t\nbe alone. I’m damned if I do, damned if I don’t.”\n\nIn many different ways, masking as outgoing and sociable can lead to an Autistic\nperson’s struggles being underestimated or erased. My friend Bethy is energetic,\nwears lots of eye-catching, bright clothing, and is covered in some of the\ncoolest tattoos I’ve ever seen. They’ve been active in Chicago’s theater and\ncircus arts communities for years, and when they’re excited, they jump and down\nsquealing with delight. Bethy also loves modeling, and is very in tune with\ntheir body and sensuality. They treat their personal style and physicality as a\nfull extension of their selfhood. For many, these qualities would be a bit\nsurprising to witness in an Autistic person. So many of us have poor\ncoordination and feel at odds with our bodies,[62] and we’re stereotyped as\nuncool nerds with no sense of style. Bethy is pretty visibly Autistic, but\nthey’re also very charming. If I didn’t know better, I’d assume their sunny,\ngraceful personality meant they had an easier time socializing than more\nwithdrawn, shy Autistic people do.\n\nBut because I know Bethy well, I realize none of that is true. While they found\nit easy to make surface-level friends at the bar where they use to work, they\nsay that bonding with someone in a deeper way proved very difficult. They\nsecond-guess themselves, and are constantly running an algorithm in the back of\ntheir mind about how their actions and words will be received by others. They\nthink a lot about how they’re perceived and rarely feel at home in any\ncommunity. Their immaculate style is also an effort to have their personhood and\nindividuality recognized by other people. They’ve always been misunderstood, and\nevery day is a fight to communicate who they really are. Bethy is masking, and\nputting extensive energy into doing so—just like inhibited, quiet me.\n\nJust as some Autistics desire a lot of social contact, some seek out a high\ndegree of stimulation and sensory input. Contrary to popular belief, Autism\ndoesn’t make a person’s hearing super sensitive or their eyes super responsive\nto light. What Autism actually does is influence how our brains filter through\nthe information taken in by our senses, and how we combine all that data into a\ncohesive whole. That can manifest in us being either sensory seekers (sometimes\ncalled sensory inattentive types)[63] or sensory avoiders—and most of us are a\ncombination of both, depending on the sense.\n\nFor various reasons I outlined in Chapter 1, neurotypical brains tend to dismiss\nsmall details that might detract from the “big picture” their brain believes it\nsees.[64] Metaphorically, when a neurotypical person sees a “forest,” their\nminds start glossing over the dead, bare trees and clumps of hedges that\ncomplicate the view.[65] In contrast, Autistic people perceive all the\nindividual trees, and stumps, and rotting animal carcasses. The thousands of\nsmall features don’t effortlessly combine into something larger for us,[66] so\nwe have to process all of it separately. It’s exhausting.\n\nWhen I walk into my apartment building at night, I’m hit with a wave of\ndiscordant sensory information. It’s particularly bothersome if I’ve already had\na stressful or emotionally taxing day and my energy is depleted. There’s the\nfrenetic chatter of my neighbors, and the chaotic slamming of doors all along\nthe hall. I can hear the elevator groaning to the ground level, my neighbor’s\nmusic thudding below me, and ambulances blaring in the distance. Each piece of\nsensory information vies for attention, and doesn’t blend into uniform\nbackground noise. In fact, the longer I have to endure it, the more annoyed I\nbecome. One way I can cope with this is by blocking out the world and dampening\nall the stimuli that are distracting me. But another, equally effective way to\ncope with sensory challenges is by seeking out really strong, bold sensations\nthat overpower all that white noise.\n\nWhen an Autistic person is a sensory seeker, they might crave loud music, spicy\nfood, blazing bright colors, or plenty of activity and motion. They don’t wear\nheadphones in public to drown out the overwhelming noise of other people, but\nbecause a thumping synthpop track helps keep them engaged and grounded. The goal\nis the same in either case—to make sense of a barrage of data that’s hard to\nprocess. A sensory seeking, fun-loving persona makes for a very effective Autism\nmask; no one sees you as an “overly sensitive” disabled person if you’re\nconstantly traveling the world and thrashing to the music at your local bar’s\nmetal night. It might even be an enjoyable mask to wear, though needing to\nconstantly seek out stimulation can prove limiting. In their essay “Autistic\nPeople Party, Too,” the writer Jesse Meadows describes how a drinking, drugging\nparty-girl persona helped them fit in with other people and find a modicum of\nsensory comfort.[67] Eventually, though, that lifestyle proved unsustainable,\nand they had to learn to seek novelty and stimulation in healthier ways.\n\nLogan Joiner is a teenager who has been sharing his passion for roller coasters\nwith the world since he was eight years old. On his two YouTube channels\n(KoasterKids and Thrills United), he has a combined viewership of nearly\nthirty-five thousand subscribers. He shares videos of himself bungee-jumping\nfrom bridges, cliff diving into open bodies of water, and racking up amusement\npark visits. Logan’s Autistic, and he got into roller coasters because they help\nhim regulate how his brain processes sensory information.\n\n“I’m not a big fan of unexpected surprises,” Logan has explained.[68] “But if\nyou think about it, roller coasters aren’t really like that…so they’re not scary\nbecause they’re predictable.”\n\nDespite how messy and noisy they can be, amusement parks can actually be quite\ncomforting to Autistic people. Amusement parks offer predictable social\ninteractions and prepackaged experiences that rarely change. The layout is\nclearly marked, the food is bland yet filling, every attraction is over in a\nmatter of minutes, and the signage is big and clear. Once you get used to a\nroller coaster, it provides consistent stimulation at expected points in time.\nFor sensory-seeking Autistics, the rushing wind and vibrations of the track can\nprovide relaxing physical input, just like a weighted blanket or fidget cube,\nonly more forceful. There are statistics to memorize, development and launch\nhistory to learn about, and a whole community of nerdy online creators to share\ncoaster and attraction lore with. Plus, on a roller coaster you can shout and\nflail your arms without anyone giving you funny looks. Since many of us have\ntrouble regulating speaking volume and love to arm-flap, roller coasters,\nconcerts, and other noisy, raucous spaces can be unexpected refuges from social\njudgment.\n\nI have known Autistics who are DJs, salespeople, team managers, nonprofit\nfund-raisers, and aerialists. The more outgoing and sensory seeking among us\nlove anime conventions, house parties, political campaigning, and competitive\nsports. It’s often very difficult, though, for these kinds of Autistic people to\nget their disability taken seriously, because they can be so outspoken and\ncharming. When they do have trouble socializing or they fall behind at work,\ntheir loved ones accuse them of “faking” that they’re having a hard time,\nbecause they found it effortless to go out and party at a burlesque show the\nevening before. It’s an all-too-common experience for disabled people, being\ntold that your skills in one area are proof that you’re “not trying hard enough”\nin another.\n\nVery few people would guess these outspoken, high-energy folks are Autistic,\nparticularly during their rambunctious childhoods. If anything about them seemed\nunusual, ADHD was probably what people guessed. Incidentally, Autism and ADHD\nco-occur at very high rates, and are diagnostically quite difficult to\nuntangle.[69] Psychologists often call them “sister conditions” because both of\nthem impact things like distractibility, sensory seeking, and being deeply\npained by social rejection. This brings me to the next group of Autistics who\noften get overlooked: those with comorbid and overlapping conditions.\n\n\nAUTISTICS WITH OTHER CONDITIONS\n\nWhen it comes to mental illness and disability, diagnostic categories are really\nflawed things. A disorder is a cluster of symptoms and traits that tend to go\ntogether, but don’t always, and the way those clusters get organized tends to\nchange over time. Psychologists have been debating for decades whether anxiety\nand depression should be considered elements of the same disorder, for example,\nor looked at as separate conditions that are just correlated.[70] Psychiatrists\nin the 1940s believed Autism was a form of childhood schizophrenia,[71] but they\ncertainly don’t see it that way now. Our understandings of these labels are\nconstantly in flux, and who gets stuck with a particular label varies across\ntime and cultural context.\n\nOften, a person exists somewhere on a spectrum between multiple disorders, or\nhas a unique combination of traits from multiple conditions. If you have ever\nhad a single manic period in your life, you may get diagnosed with Bipolar\nDisorder rather than Major Depressive Disorder, for instance, even if the\ndepressive episodes massively outnumber the manic ones. On the flip side, if you\ndon’t meet the low weight requirement for Anorexia, you may never get your\ndisorder recognized no matter how much anguish it presents in your life. This\ndynamic is particularly challenging for people with Autism Spectrum traits,\nbecause our neurotype is so multifaceted and so easily mistaken for other\nconditions.\n\nPeople with post-traumatic stress disorder, for example, can look very similar\nto Autistic people. PTSD sufferers tend to be afraid of large crowds, are easily\nrattled by loud noises, and become more reserved when placed in hard-to-read\nsituations. PTSD-fueled hypervigilance can look a lot like masking: you’re\nconstantly scanning your environment for threats, and modulating how you present\nyourself, so you can stay safe. To complicate matters, many Autistic people\nexperience trauma at a young age, and have PTSD symptoms from that. It’s common\nfor us to be mistreated by parents and caregivers, bullied by classmates, or\nseen as “easy prey” by abusers. The leading treatment for Autism in children,\nApplied Behavioral Analysis therapy (or ABA for short), has widely been\ncriticized by Autistic people as being traumatic to endure.\n\nFor all these reasons, it’s not always possible (or helpful) to try to untangle\nwhich of a person’s traits are Autistic and which are caused by the trauma of\nbeing neurodiverse in a neurotypical world. Daan is a forty-year-old man living\nin the Netherlands, and in addition to being Autistic, he was abused by both his\nparents. He tells me his diagnosis of complex PTSD effectively masked his\nneurodivergence for many, many years.\n\n“I assume everybody is talking about me and is a hair’s breadth from blowing up\nand calling me a horrible person,” he says. “And is this Autism and not having a\ngood theory of other people’s thinking? Or is it that my mother would hurl\ninvectives at me if I so much as put the sponge on the wrong side of the sink?\nThere is no answer.”\n\nDaan’s first trauma therapist tried to teach him that his fears were irrational;\nhis mother was long dead, she told him, and could never hurt him again. She\nbelieved that she could help him question the “illogical belief” he had that\npeople were unsafe. But Daan was still actively being hurt and rejected almost\nevery day of his life because he was Autistic. His perceptions of the social\nworld as menacing were realistic, not illogical.\n\n“I would make observations that were just, literal facts, like oh hey you got a\nhaircut, and people would think I was making fun of them,” he tells me. “My boss\nscreamed at me for that. Girls would go out with me and then berate me for not\nacting the way they expected a grown man to act. It was like my mother attacking\nme all over again. And then I would go to the therapist and she’d say I was\nreliving my trauma with my mother and seeing her in other people. It was\nhorrible, crazy-making stuff really.”\n\nClinical studies show Daan’s experiences are far from abnormal. Therapy that is\nfocused on battling “irrational beliefs,” such as cognitive behavioral therapy\n(CBT), doesn’t work as well on Autistic people as it does on neurotypicals.[72]\nOne reason for that is many of the fears and inhibitions of Autistic people are\noften entirely reasonable, and rooted in a lifetime of painful experiences. We\ntend to be pretty rational people, and many of us are already inclined to\nanalyze our thoughts and feelings very closely (sometimes excessively so).\nAutistics don’t need cognitive behavioral training to help us not be ruled by\nour emotions. In fact, most of us have been browbeaten into ignoring our\nfeelings too much.\n\nRecently, Daan switched therapists. His new therapist had only taken one\ncontinuing education course on Autistic adults in her entire career, but that\nstill made her better informed than most providers. She sent Daan to get\nassessed, and began to read up on how to alter her therapeutic practice to fit\nhim better.\n\n“My new therapist admits there isn’t much research on helping Autistic people\nwork through trauma,” he explains. “But she at least got me evaluated. And that\nhas unlocked a world of understanding for me, because it’s helped me talk to\nother Autistics online.”\n\nAutism can also look a lot like an anxiety disorder. Most of us are anxious\nnearly every moment we’re around other people, after all. Overstimulating,\nunpredictable surroundings will tend to activate our fight-or-flight response.\nThe rituals and repetitive behaviors we develop to cope with stress can look a\nlot like Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. Autistic burnout presents very much like\na major depressive episode. All too often, these negative mental health\nconsequences of masking are what a therapist recognizes, rather than the\nuntreated disability that’s caused it.\n\nSome undiagnosed Autistic people (particularly women) identify as “highly\nsensitive persons.”[73] Highly sensitive persons are generally described as\nintuitive, emotionally astute, and easily overwhelmed. Even the creator of the\nterm, Elaine N. Aron, has revealed that some of the highly sensitive family\nmembers she has described in writing later found out they were Autistic.[74] The\nstigma that comes with Autism (and its very male, standoffish associations) may\nbe part of why so many women on the spectrum find labels such as anxious and\nhighly sensitive to be far more resonant.\n\nIn some cases, marginalized Autistic people get stuck with mental health\ndiagnoses that are even more reviled and misunderstood than Autism is. It’s\nquite common for adult Autistic women to be incorrectly labeled with Borderline\nPersonality Disorder, for instance.[75] This is a really disastrous diagnosis.\nBorderline Personality Disorder is many therapists’ least favorite condition to\nwork with.[76] As a group, they’re commonly viewed as overly dramatic, needy,\nattention seeking, unreliable, and even abusive.[77] When I’ve taught\npsychotherapists in training, many of them have shared with me that their\nsupervisors taught them to avoid BPD sufferers like the plague, and to never\neven befriend a person with BPD traits.\n\nThough it’s called a disorder of “personality,” BPD could perhaps be more\ncorrectly described as a disorder of attachment and emotional processing.[78]\nPeople with BPD fear rejection very intensely. They have an unstable sense of\nself that’s highly dependent on the acceptance of others. They’re often\ndescribed by loved ones and therapists as having extreme emotions that seem\ninappropriate or manipulative.[79] If these sound eerily similar to the “female\nAutism traits” from the table earlier in this chapter, that’s not a coincidence.\nMany women (and other gender minorities) who have been repeatedly rejected and\ntraumatized for being Autistic develop an insecure sense of self, a (reasonable)\nfear of rejection, and big “overly sensitive” emotions that reflect the distress\nthey almost constantly feel.\n\nNylah is one such woman who was incorrectly labeled as BPD before finally\narriving at an Autism diagnosis. She had all the traits that tend to overlap:\ninsecure self-esteem, fear of being abandoned that would prompt emotional\nmeltdowns, and an unstable sense of who she was.\n\n“I used to pretend to be whoever my boyfriends wanted me to be so they wouldn’t\nleave me. And that was supposedly so manipulative and evil of me,” she says.\n\nIn actuality, Nylah was trying desperately to not be alone. If a partner was\ninto hockey, she filled her wardrobe with hockey jerseys. If a guy liked women\nwho dressed up, she started getting weekly manicures. It didn’t work great, but\nit was all she knew.\n\n“Living so falsely made me feel suicidal, and what do you know, attempting\nsuicide when you have Borderline means you’re manipulating people for\nattention,” she says. “I was the one constantly setting myself up to be taken\nadvantage of, but with the Borderline target put on my back, I was a hysterical\nvillain in people’s eyes.”\n\nNylah only began to question this narrative about herself when a relative\nreceived an Autism diagnosis. At age sixty-five, her mother got assessed—after\nmany decades of carrying an equally stigmatizing Narcissistic Personality\nDisorder diagnosis.\n\nNylah says, “My mother is very self-involved, but that’s because she literally\ncannot understand what’s happening in others’ brains and she can get so locked\ninto her own view. Her actions can seem selfish because Autism gets in the way\nof her empathy. I have really intense empathy, it is painful almost, and she is\nthe flip side. She just doesn’t have it. But is that evil? She literally cannot\nhelp it.”\n\nNylah shares with me that though her mother is inconsiderate and stubborn, she\nis also a woman who cares deeply about the world. Anything that gets in the way\nof her activism is a threat to be excised from her life. Recognizing that about\nher mom, and admiring that passionate, dedicated side of her has helped Nylah\nfeel more at peace about their relationship.\n\n“She cares very much about feminism and saving the environment. Her heart is big\nand it is wounded. She’s a difficult person doing her very best, which in a\nBlack woman seeking therapy in the 1970s meant you were a narcissist,\napparently.”\n\nAn article by psychiatrists Meng-Chaun Lai and Simon Baron-Cohen, published in\nthe medical journal The Lancet, has proposed that an entire generation of\nAutistic people were misdiagnosed as having personality disorders.[80]\nUnsurprisingly, they propose that most of the misdiagnosed were marginalized\nwomen. Usually, I find a lot of problems with Baron-Cohen’s work; he has long\nbeen an advocate for the view that Autism is best understood as an “extremely\nmale brain.”[81] Yet in this research, he seems to acknowledge that the reason\nmany women are not diagnosed as Autistic is because they’re labeled as\nBorderline, Histrionic, or Narcissistic instead. Getting stuck with a\npersonality disorder diagnosis also makes it very difficult for a patient to\nfind affirming, compassionate mental health care, particularly if that stigma\ninterweaves with sexism or misogynoir.[82]\n\nAs I briefly mentioned above, Autism and ADHD co-occur and overlap immensely.\nBoth disabilities relate to a person’s “executive functioning,” meaning their\nability to plan ahead, divide large goals into smaller steps, sequence tasks in\na logical order, and self-motivate to complete them. Yet even the fact that we\nstruggle with these activities is contextual, and cultural: in a world where\nrugged individualism wasn’t prioritized, it might not be a disability to need\nhelp finding your car keys. Both Autistics and ADHDers are easily distracted by\nstimuli, yet also prone to hyperfixating on activities we find enjoyable,\ngetting engrossed for hours without remembering to pee or eat. Generally\nspeaking, Autistics tend to perceive themselves as having more control over what\nthey hyperfocus on than ADHDers do. ADHDers are more likely to describe boredom\nand understimulation as painful, where as some Autistics really enjoy stillness\nand quiet. Both neurotypes are underdiagnosed in women and people of color, and\nthose who aren’t diagnosed at a young age typically wind up masking for decades\nbefore figuring their identity out.[83]\n\nThough ADHD is not believed by professionals to affect emotional processing and\nsocial skills development directly, one prominent experience among ADHDers is\nrejection-sensitive dysphoria, feeling intense panic and distress when receiving\nnegative (or even neutral) social feedback from other people. Because ADHDers\nfind rejection so terrifying and painful, their social behavior can be just as\nrestrained and people-pleasing as that of masked Autistics. Autistics may have\ntrouble guessing what other people are feeling or understanding unspoken social\nnorms, but ADHDers may also be accused of being “oblivious” too, talking at\nlength without picking up on others’ boredom, or getting so lost in a video game\nor favorite hobby that they miss their roommate frustratedly doing all the\ncleaning. The underlying mechanisms might be different, in other words, but many\nof the struggles are the same.\n\nWhile ADHDers don’t appear to process information in as bottom-up a fashion as\nAutistics do, the high energy and anxiety associated with the neurotype can look\nincredibly similar to how Autistics react to overwhelming sensory\ninformation.[84] And while some masked Autistics may generally be better at\nstaying on task, maintaining a consistent schedule, and keeping organized\ncompared to the average ADHD, many of us are so chronically exhausted and burnt\nout that we experience the same struggles with daily life that people with ADHD\ndo. Plus there are plenty of non-masked Autistics who require daily assistance,\nso it’s not fair to say that Autism is a more functional or organized\nneurotype—however, Autism is often stereotyped to be the “order” to ADHD’s\n“chaos.”\n\nThough we have many experiences in common, there are some differences between\nADHDers and Autistics worth noting. First, an ADHD diagnosis is easier to\nreceive as an adult, though it comes with the very stigmatizing assumptions that\npatients’ brains are “broken” and require stimulant drug treatment.[85] Second,\nthe accommodations many people with ADHD require can be incompatible with what\nAutistic people need. As an Autistic person without ADHD, I need a quiet,\nprivate, clean space in order to feel calm and focused. I also need silence and\ndarkness in order to sleep. Many people with ADHD, in contrast, require\nstimulation, novelty, and sensory input. They may need the television blaring\nwhile studying, for example, or may be unable to sleep without music on. Clutter\nand mess overwhelms many Autistic people; for many ADHDers “visual noise” is\neasy to ignore, so much so that messes can “disappear” from their field of view.\nADHDer friends often enlist my help looking for their phones and keys because\nthey can’t scan through their piles of stuff to find it. To them it’s all just a\nmorass of white noise, but I can instantly locate specific objects at a glance.\n\nMany ADHDers that I know describe themselves as “time blind,” or as perceiving\ntime as moving in a spiral or series of waves. I experience time quite linearly,\nand rigidly, and have never been late to an appointment or missed a deadline in\nmy life. Writers and creatives who have ADHD tend to work in big bursts of\nlate-night passion, and put their work together in an associative, big-picture\nway. I work on a consistent schedule, analyzing sources and putting them\ntogether piece by tiny piece. But I also have an impulsive and chaotic streak,\nwhich might have gotten me labeled ADHD (or Borderline, or something else) if I\nhadn’t been better at hiding it when I was young.\n\nA number of the Autistic people I interviewed for this book are also ADHDers. So\nare many of the writers, mental health providers, and activists I quote. Within\nthe Autistic self-advocacy community, people with ADHD are usually treated as\nhonorary members by default. And the more we learn about the two neurotypes, the\nless they seem like distinct categories. They are, in every sense, sibling\ndisabilities, two highly similar groups who belong in community with one\nanother.[86]\n\nIn addition to overlapping with many mental disabilities and disorders, Autism\nalso co-occurs frequently with physical disabilities like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome\n(EDS),[87] gastrointestinal disorders,[88] and epilepsy.[89] Heather Morgan, who\nhas physical disabilities as well as Autism, says we can think of some\nconditions as sharing Autism’s genetic markers.\n\n“I think there are more of us in that category than we necessarily realize,” she\ntells me. “[P]eople with disabilities that maybe aren’t typical Autism, but have\nAutistic characteristics in their genetic sequence.”\n\nWhen Autism intersects with other disorders or disabilities, traits can take on\nnew forms or be hidden entirely. I’m close friends with the family of Angel, an\nAutistic teenager with traumatic brain injuries and intellectual disabilities.\nIf Angel hadn’t been diagnosed with Autism prior to the car accident that caused\nhis brain injury, doctors might never have recognized him as Autistic at all.\nThey might have believed, for example, that he couldn’t speak because of neural\ndamage caused by the car accident. If that had been the case, Angel wouldn’t\nhave gotten his augmented communication device, or the iPad he uses to chat with\nfriends on social media. Thankfully, Angel’s family and care team figured out\nthat his lack of verbal communication wasn’t caused by an inability to express\nhimself, but by an Autistic need for nonverbal methods of self-expression.\n\nAngel is a rare example of a masked Autistic person who isn’t viewed by the\npeople around him as “high functioning” or high in intelligence. Of course, the\nvery idea that certain Autistic people function more highly than others, or that\nfunctioning status is a binary quality you can catch at a glance, is problematic\nin its own right. That kind of thinking leads to many of us having our\ndisabilities erased, and the private suffering that makes public “functioning”\npossible is ignored. It also perpetuates the idea that the only disabled lives\nworth living are those that can still manage to be productive or impressive in\nsome conventional way.\n\n\n“HIGHLY FUNCTIONING” AUTISTICS\n\nNeurotypical people are obsessed with functioning levels. If you tell a\nnondisabled person that you’re Autistic, but you’re able to hold a conversation\nor maintain a job, they’ll immediately start gushing about how functional you\nare. Usually, that remark comes with the implication that you don’t really count\nas disabled because you can fake a nondisabled status (if only for a moment).\nWhen I was doing press for my first book, I received a fair share of comments\nlike the following, which was left on a YouTube livestream in which I\nappeared:[90]\n\n“If Dr. Price is autistic then they are extremely high functioning. Most people\nwith autism spend their whole lives barely able to hold down a job because\nthey’re unable to meaningfully or appropriately interact with others, nor are\nthey able to focus on anything intently for any extended period of time or if\nthey do, it’s something that’s extremely trivial and irrelevant.”\n\nThere is a lot to unpack in this comment. First is the commenter’s assumption\nthat because I seem to function “highly,” my being Autistic is somewhat dubious\nto him. He says “if” I’m Autistic I must be high functioning, not that I am\nAutistic and capable or accomplished. He sees the two things as incompatible.\nFurthermore, he seems to think I don’t really count as Autistic, because I can\nfeign normality so well during an hourlong conversation. Another thing that\njumps out is the way he equates holding down a job with having a life of value.\nIn this commenter’s view, I am a high-functioning Autistic because I can\nhyperfocus on something that makes money. Autistic passions that aren’t\nmoneymaking are, as he says, “trivial” and “irrelevant.” That word irrelevant is\nalso particularly striking—it’s as if the Autistic person’s own feelings and\npleasure do not matter at all, only how their life is received by others.\n\nWhen neurotypical people equate “functioning” with being less disabled, they\nfail to recognize the immense, hidden labor that goes into appearing normal. It\nalso misses just how oppressive having to seem normal is by itself. It’s\nreminiscent of when I see a fat person proudly identify themselves as fat, only\nto be corrected by a thin person with a dismissive, “You’re not fat! You’re just\ncurvy! You’re so pretty!” That kind of response betrays discomfort with fatness\nand fat pride, and reveals a latent belief that one can’t be fat and beautiful\nat the same time. But a person can be both fat and beautiful, the two attributes\nare completely independent of one another. On top of that, it’s insulting that a\nperson’s beauty is part of how their value is defined. Conversely, an Autistic\nperson can function in one (or many) realms of public life, while being\nsignificantly disabled in others. Furthermore, some people don’t “function”\nindependently in any area of life at all, and that shouldn’t detract from their\nvalue and the respect they receive, either.\n\nThe Instagram account @MyAutisticNurse documents the life of one “high\nfunctioning” Autistic person, a nurse who goes by the nickname Boo.[91] By all\naccounts, Boo is a fantastic nurse; her mind is a repository of medical facts\nthat she can call from memory at will. She’s excellent at working with pediatric\npatients and putting them at ease. She also has days when she is completely\nunable to speak. After an especially stressful shift at her hospital, she spends\nhours on the floor, lining up her favorite toys over and over. Like any other\nAutistic person, she has meltdowns and low-energy days, but because she’s\nintelligent and capable, her Autism doesn’t fit the “typical” mold.\n\nUntil 2013, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders drew a\ndistinction between Autism and Asperger’s Syndrome. Autism was more profoundly\ndebilitating and associated with major communication deficits and intellectual\nchallenges. Asperger’s, on the other hand, occurred in people with high\nintelligence, and was associated with well-spoken, emotionally frosty math\ngeniuses and computer nerds. The 2013 edition of the DSM folded both labels into\none: Autism Spectrum Disorder, or ASD. Today, instead of talking about how\nAutism differs from Asperger’s, clinicians discuss whether someone is “high or\nlow functioning” or what level their “support needs” are.\n\nThe Autistic Self Advocacy Network (or ASAN) and other organizations led by\nAutistic people reject terms like high functioning and low functioning. Those\nwords oversimplify how a disability affects a person’s life, and equates their\nproductivity with their value as a human being.[92] A person who can speak,\nsocialize, and hold down a job may strike outside observers as very “high\nfunctioning”; in private, that same person may need help getting dressed, or may\nrequire people to remind them when to eat. Boo’s husband, for example, has\ncreated an easy-to-read chart listing all the snacks they have available at\nhome, to help Boo process what to do when she is feeling hungry and run-down. He\nalso helps motivate her to do things like brushing or washing her hair,\nactivities that are both necessary and painful for her.\n\nConversely, a seemingly “low functioning” Autistic person who cannot speak or\ndress themselves may be able to excel in school or solve complex math equations,\nso long as they are provided with accommodations. The writer and activist Ido\nKedar spent much of his early life unable to communicate with anyone. He\ncouldn’t speak verbally, and his motor control made it difficult to write. Then\nhe learned to type on an iPad, and his blog “Ido in Autismland” was born. Ido\nhas written two books, given countless interviews, and continues to post\nregularly about Autism and disability justice to his blog. He also graduated\nfrom high school with a 3.9 GPA and is currently working his way through\ncollege. Academically and intellectually, Ido functions at a very high level,\nnow that he has the support to make that possible. Yet because he can’t speak\nand lacked that support for a long time, he occupied a “low functioning”\nposition in society for many years.\n\nCases like Ido’s and Boo’s really highlight how superficial functioning labels\ncan be. Still, they shape how psychiatrists, teachers, and parents think about\nAutism, and it does tend to be the people considered “high functioning” who can\nmask the most readily, and who therefore miss getting diagnosed. Generally\nspeaking, if an Autistic person was verbal from a young age and could fake some\nsocial niceties, they were likely to either be considered “high functioning” as\nkids, or they weren’t identified as Autistic at all. This is a bit ironic,\nbecause learning to speak at an early age was an early indicator of Asperger’s\nDisorder.[93] My mom claims that I said my first word at six months old, and was\nspeaking in sentences by the time I was one. I supposedly shocked a department\nstore clerk as a one-year-old by greeting him and declaring “I believe I smell\npotpourri.” My whole family has tons of stories like these. Many people who\neither were labeled as having Asperger’s in the 1990s or are considered “high\nfunctioning” now have similar stories of being hyperverbal toddlers. It often\nled to us being filtered into gifted education programs rather than special\neducation, which came with both advantages and its fair share of poorly\nboundaried, objectifying experiences.\n\nFor me, and for countless “high functioning” Autistics, communication and\nintelligence become an essential part of our masks. I never could fit in with\nother kids, but I could impress teachers with my grasp of big words and my\nsophisticated-sounding opinions. Though my language was highly developed, my\nsocial and emotional life was not. I annoyed other kids by talking too much\nabout subjects that didn’t interest them. I clung to adults who found me\n“impressive” and equated being well-behaved with being mature and worthy of\ntheir respect. I also absorbed the idea, common to many “gifted” children, that\na person’s intellectual potential belongs to society, not to themselves, and\nthey owe the world greatness to justify their oddness. In my adolescence,\nEnglish teachers adored my papers, and I excelled on the debate team, but I was\nbrittle and distant to my friends and made all kinds of reckless personal\ndecisions (such as shoplifting and skipping classes that I didn’t like) to the\npoint where I nearly got arrested and expelled. I got so attached to seeing\nmyself as smart and accomplished that I neglected my physical health in the\npursuit of success, too. Until I was in my mid twenties and realized I was\nAutistic, I was basically a perpetual adolescent, performing intelligence for\npraise but mismanaging my personal life and not connecting with anyone in a\ndeeper way.\n\nNylah had a similar experience. “I was a fantastic saleswoman when my life was\nat its most dysfunctional,” she tells me. “I could charm anyone if they didn’t\nget to know me, really know me, and see how much I was drinking and lying to\nprop that life up.”\n\nHiding self-destructiveness behind a mountain of achievements isn’t functioning,\nnot really. The very concept of “functioning status” is predicated on the logic\nof capitalism and the legacy of the Protestant work ethic, which both have\ntrained us to believe that a person’s productivity determines their worth.[94]\nNo one is more harmed by this worldview than the disabled people who cannot work\nand produce value at all, and are the most likely to wind up abused, forcibly\ninstitutionalized, or homeless as a result. Equating a person’s social value (or\neven their right to exist) with their productivity is sadly a common outlook,\nbut it’s also a profoundly alienating and ableist one. It harms the Autistic\npeople who are able to “play the game” and mask as productive and respectful;\nfor the Autistics who cannot play along, that game can quickly turn dangerous,\neven deadly.\n\n\nMEETING MASKED AUTISTICS AND FINDING YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY\n\nSpaces like the Autistic Self Advocacy Network and Autistics Against Curing\nAutism embrace self-realized Autistics, because the community recognizes not\neveryone will have the chance to get a fair or affordable assessment. Plus, many\npeople with subclinical Autistic traits may share common struggles and goals\nwith us, and deserve to be included in our ranks. This includes the parents or\nrelatives of diagnosed Autistic children who come to realize they’re on the\nspectrum as well, and people with “sibling conditions” like ADHD or PTSD.\n\nI want Autistic people to experience less shame about who they are, and to learn\nto take off the restrictive masks that have trapped us for decades. The first\nstep to unmasking is accepting who you are, and finding others with similar\nexperiences. You don’t need a piece of paper from an assessor to begin to do\nthat.\n\nIf you suspect you are Autistic, I encourage you to find a local Autistic Self\nAdvocacy Network (ASAN) chapter, and begin to read writing and watch videos\nAutistic people have posted online. Learn a bit about just how varied our\nexperiences and identities are. As you learn more, you may find you feel at home\namong us. Or you might find out some other community (such as the ADHDer\ncommunity, or the broader Mad Pride movement) is a better fit. Both outcomes are\nperfectly okay. Even if you conclude you are not Autistic, your self-exploration\nwill mean you’ve learned a whole lot about a group that could use more\nunderstanding allies.\n\nWhen I was first exploring an Autistic identity for myself, I checked out videos\nby Autistic creators and activists, who showed me just how varied Autistic\npeople can be, both in terms of personality and interests. The more Autistic\nvoices I read and listened to, the less Autism felt like a curse. The shame I\nfelt about my identity began to ebb, and pride in who I was gradually replaced\nit.\n\nOnce I had enough confidence to say I resonated with Autistic experiences, I put\neffort into meeting fellow Autistic people in the flesh. I met people at a local\ngroup, Autistics Against Curing Autism, run by Timotheus Gordon Jr. I also\nattended a local genderqueer support group and where nearly half the attendees\nwere neurodiverse. I posted on Autism support groups online, like the subreddit\nr/AutismTranslated, and got to know others like me in those ways. These\nconnections to the Autism self-advocacy world wound up doing far more for me\nthan the psychological establishment did. Establishing official recognition of\nmy disability was challenging, bureaucratic, and ultimately felt very hollow and\nmeaningless—much like getting legal recognition of my gender. I was Autistic\nlong before any professional recognized it, just as I was trans long before the\nstate acknowledged it. However, nothing aided me in accepting myself and\nunmasking quite like finding my “people” and seeing proof positive that there\nwas nothing wrong with us.\n\nIf you suspect you might be Autistic, I hope you can seek out similar spaces and\nresources for yourself. ASAN has chapters in many major cities, and online\nAutism groups are filled with supportive people who love to answer questions and\nshare their own stories. On most social media sites, the #ActuallyAutistic and\n#AdultAutistic tags are filled with useful posts. You might also wish to seek\nout tools created by Autistic people, for Autistic people. For example, weighted\nblankets or fidget toys sold by sites like Stimtastic might help soothe your\nanxiety. Or the social skills toolkits offered on blogs like\nRealSocialSkills.org may help you develop greater confidence in interacting with\npeople, disabled and neurotypical alike. It is not cultural appropriation or\n“faking a disability” to try out these tools. If Autism-friendly resources and\nadaptations prove helpful to you, that’s another key signal you belong in our\nspaces, or at the very least have a great deal in common with us.\n\nUltimately, I can’t tell you if you are Autistic, and I don’t necessarily think\nit’s something we have to discuss in a binary or categorical way. Autism is a\nspectrum, a rainbow of different shades and hues that thrive when they stand\nbeautifully together. For too long we have hidden what makes us unique, fearing\nwe’re broken or unlovable. Embracing Autism means shedding that mask and finding\nsafe ways to share our vibrant colors with the world.\n\nIn the next chapter, I’ll explain how the ableism, sexism, and white supremacy\nlurking behind early Autism research created the pressure for so many of us to\n“mask.” I’ll outline what the gradual development of the mask looks like over\nthe course of an Autistic person’s early life, and discuss the science on what\nmasking really is and what psychological processes undergird it. I’ll provide\nsome tools and exercises for investigating your own mask, and where it might\nhave come from. We’ll also reflect on the psychological and emotional costs of\nmasking. In the chapters that follow, I’ll introduce you to Autistic people who\nare slowly unlearning Autism stigma and taking their masks off, and provide some\ntricks and tips developed by Autistic coaches, counselors, and activists. We’ll\nalso discuss some public policy changes that would help Autistic people and\nother neurodiverse groups attain justice. As the next portion of the book will\noutline, masking is just as pervasive as Autism is. It’s much more than faking a\nsmile—it impacts how we identify, how we dress, the careers we choose, our\nrelationships, and even how we lay out our homes. When we unmask, we get to\nreexamine every choice that we’ve made to “fit in,” and begin to construct more\nauthentic and affirming lives. A world that is more tolerant of difference is a\nsafer and more nourishing place for everyone. And we can begin to build that\nworld today, simply by questioning the ways we’ve been forced to live, and\nchoosing instead to exist proudly as ourselves."},{"title":"Test Section Title","content":"INDEX\n\nThe page numbers in this index refer to the printed version of the book.
