THE PEQUOD MEETS THE DELIGHT.\n\nThe intense Pequod sailed on; the rolling waves and days went by; the\nlife-buoy-coffin still lightly swung; and another ship, most miserably misnamed\nthe Delight, was descried. As she drew nigh, all eyes were fixed upon her broad\nbeams, called shears, which, in some whaling-ships, cross the quarter-deck at\nthe height of eight or nine feet; serving to carry the spare, unrigged, or\ndisabled boats.\n\nUpon the stranger’s shears were beheld the shattered, white ribs, and some few\nsplintered planks, of what had once been a whale-boat; but you now saw through\nthis wreck, as plainly as you see through the peeled, half-unhinged, and\nbleaching skeleton of a horse.\n\n“Hast seen the White Whale?”\n\n“Look!” replied the hollow-cheeked captain from his taffrail; and with his\ntrumpet he pointed to the wreck.\n\n“Hast killed him?”\n\n“The harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that,” answered the other,\nsadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck, whose gathered sides some\nnoiseless sailors were busy in sewing together.\n\n“Not forged!” and snatching Perth’s levelled iron from the crotch, Ahab held it\nout, exclaiming—“Look ye, Nantucketer; here in this hand I hold his death!\nTempered in blood, and tempered by lightning are these barbs; and I swear to\ntemper them triply in that hot place behind the fin, where the White Whale most\nfeels his accursed life!”\n\n“Then God keep thee, old man—see’st thou that”—pointing to the hammock—“I bury\nbut one of five stout men, who were alive only yesterday; but were dead ere\nnight. Only that one I bury; the rest were buried before they died; you sail\nupon their tomb.” Then turning to his crew—“Are ye ready there? place the plank\nthen on the rail, and lift the body; so, then—Oh! God”—advancing towards the\nhammock with uplifted hands—“may the resurrection and the life——”\n\n“Brace forward! Up helm!” cried Ahab like lightning to his men.\n\nBut the suddenly started Pequod was not quick enough to escape the sound of the\nsplash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea; not so quick, indeed, but\nthat some of the flying bubbles might have sprinkled her hull with their ghostly\nbaptism.\n\nAs Ahab now glided from the dejected Delight, the strange life-buoy hanging at\nthe Pequod’s stern came into conspicuous relief.\n\n“Ha! yonder! look yonder, men!” cried a foreboding voice in her wake. “In vain,\noh, ye strangers, ye fly our sad burial; ye but turn us your taffrail to show us\nyour coffin!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 132. THE SYMPHONY.\n\nIt was a clear steel-blue day. The firmaments of air and sea were hardly\nseparable in that all-pervading azure; only, the pensive air was transparently\npure and soft, with a woman’s look, and the robust and man-like sea heaved with\nlong, strong, lingering swells, as Samson’s chest in his sleep.\n\nHither, and thither, on high, glided the snow-white wings of small, unspeckled\nbirds; these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air; but to and fro in the\ndeeps, far down in the bottomless blue, rushed mighty leviathans, sword-fish,\nand sharks; and these were the strong, troubled, murderous thinkings of the\nmasculine sea.\n\nBut though thus contrasting within, the contrast was only in shades and shadows\nwithout; those two seemed one; it was only the sex, as it were, that\ndistinguished them.\n\nAloft, like a royal czar and king, the sun seemed giving this gentle air to this\nbold and rolling sea; even as bride to groom. And at the girdling line of the\nhorizon, a soft and tremulous motion—most seen here at the equator—denoted the\nfond, throbbing trust, the loving alarms, with which the poor bride gave her\nbosom away.\n\nTied up and twisted; gnarled and knotted with wrinkles; haggardly firm and\nunyielding; his eyes glowing like coals, that still glow in the ashes of ruin;\nuntottering Ahab stood forth in the clearness of the morn; lifting his\nsplintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl’s forehead of heaven.\n\nOh, immortal infancy, and innocency of the azure! Invisible winged creatures\nthat frolic all round us! Sweet childhood of air and sky! how oblivious were ye\nof old Ahab’s close-coiled woe! But so have I seen little Miriam and Martha,\nlaughing-eyed elves, heedlessly gambol around their old sire; sporting with the\ncircle of singed locks which grew on the marge of that burnt-out crater of his\nbrain.\n\nSlowly crossing the deck from the scuttle, Ahab leaned over the side and watched\nhow his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze, the more and the more\nthat he strove to pierce the profundity. But the lovely aromas in that enchanted\nair did at last seem to dispel, for a moment, the cankerous thing in his soul.\nThat glad, happy air, that winsome sky, did at last stroke and caress him; the\nstep-mother world, so long cruel—forbidding—now threw affectionate arms round\nhis stubborn neck, and did seem to joyously sob over him, as if over one, that\nhowever wilful and erring, she could yet find it in her heart to save and to\nbless. From beneath his slouched hat Ahab dropped a tear into the sea; nor did\nall the Pacific contain such wealth as that one wee drop.\n\nStarbuck saw the old man; saw him, how he heavily leaned over the side; and he\nseemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless sobbing that stole out of\nthe centre of the serenity around. Careful not to touch him, or be noticed by\nhim, he yet drew near to him, and stood there.\n\nAhab turned.\n\n“Starbuck!”\n\n“Sir.”\n\n“Oh, Starbuck! it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky. On such a\nday—very much such a sweetness as this—I struck my first whale—a boy-harpooneer\nof eighteen! Forty—forty—forty years ago!—ago! Forty years of continual whaling!\nforty years of privation, and peril, and storm-time! forty years on the pitiless\nsea! for forty years has Ahab forsaken the peaceful land, for forty years to\nmake war on the horrors of the deep! Aye and yes, Starbuck, out of those forty\nyears I have not spent three ashore. When I think of this life I have led; the\ndesolation of solitude it has been; the masoned, walled-town of a Captain’s\nexclusiveness, which admits but small entrance to any sympathy from the green\ncountry without—oh, weariness! heaviness! Guinea-coast slavery of solitary\ncommand!—when I think of all this; only half-suspected, not so keenly known to\nme before—and how for forty years I have fed upon dry salted fare—fit emblem of\nthe dry nourishment of my soil!—when the poorest landsman has had fresh fruit to\nhis daily hand, and broken the world’s fresh bread to my mouldy crusts—away,\nwhole oceans away, from that young girl-wife I wedded past fifty, and sailed for\nCape Horn the next day, leaving but one dent in my marriage pillow—wife?\nwife?—rather a widow with her husband alive! Aye, I widowed that poor girl when\nI married her, Starbuck; and then, the madness, the frenzy, the boiling blood\nand the smoking brow, with which, for a thousand lowerings old Ahab has\nfuriously, foamingly chased his prey—more a demon than a man!—aye, aye! what a\nforty years’ fool—fool—old fool, has old Ahab been! Why this strife of the\nchase? why weary, and palsy the arm at the oar, and the iron, and the lance? how\nthe richer or better is Ahab now? Behold. Oh, Starbuck! is it not hard, that\nwith this weary load I bear, one poor leg should have been snatched from under\nme? Here, brush this old hair aside; it blinds me, that I seem to weep. Locks so\ngrey did never grow but from out some ashes! But do I look very old, so very,\nvery old, Starbuck? I feel deadly faint, bowed, and humped, as though I were\nAdam, staggering beneath the piled centuries since Paradise. God! God!\nGod!—crack my heart!—stave my brain!—mockery! mockery! bitter, biting mockery of\ngrey hairs, have I lived enough joy to wear ye; and seem and feel thus\nintolerably old? Close! stand close to me, Starbuck; let me look into a human\neye; it is better than to gaze into sea or sky; better than to gaze upon God. By\nthe green land; by the bright hearth-stone! this is the magic glass, man; I see\nmy wife and my child in thine eye. No, no; stay on board, on board!—lower not\nwhen I do; when branded Ahab gives chase to Moby Dick. That hazard shall not be\nthine. No, no! not with the far away home I see in that eye!”\n\n“Oh, my Captain! my Captain! noble soul! grand old heart, after all! why should\nany one give chase to that hated fish! Away with me! let us fly these deadly\nwaters! let us home! Wife and child, too, are Starbuck’s—wife and child of his\nbrotherly, sisterly, play-fellow youth; even as thine, sir, are the wife and\nchild of thy loving, longing, paternal old age! Away! let us away!—this instant\nlet me alter the course! How cheerily, how hilariously, O my Captain, would we\nbowl on our way to see old Nantucket again! I think, sir, they have some such\nmild blue days, even as this, in Nantucket.”\n\n“They have, they have. I have seen them—some summer days in the morning. About\nthis time—yes, it is his noon nap now—the boy vivaciously wakes; sits up in bed;\nand his mother tells him of me, of cannibal old me; how I am abroad upon the\ndeep, but will yet come back to dance him again.”\n\n“’Tis my Mary, my Mary herself! She promised that my boy, every morning, should\nbe carried to the hill to catch the first glimpse of his father’s sail! Yes,\nyes! no more! it is done! we head for Nantucket! Come, my Captain, study out the\ncourse, and let us away! See, see! the boy’s face from the window! the boy’s\nhand on the hill!”\n\nBut Ahab’s glance was averted; like a blighted fruit tree he shook, and cast his\nlast, cindered apple to the soil.\n\n“What is it, what nameless, inscrutable, unearthly thing is it; what cozening,\nhidden lord and master, and cruel, remorseless emperor commands me; that against\nall natural lovings and longings, I so keep pushing, and crowding, and jamming\nmyself on all the time; recklessly making me ready to do what in my own proper,\nnatural heart, I durst not so much as dare? Is Ahab, Ahab? Is it I, God, or who,\nthat lifts this arm? But if the great sun move not of himself; but is as an\nerrand-boy in heaven; nor one single star can revolve, but by some invisible\npower; how then can this one small heart beat; this one small brain think\nthoughts; unless God does that beating, does that thinking, does that living,\nand not I. By heaven, man, we are turned round and round in this world, like\nyonder windlass, and Fate is the handspike. And all the time, lo! that smiling\nsky, and this unsounded sea! Look! see yon Albicore! who put it into him to\nchase and fang that flying-fish? Where do murderers go, man! Who’s to doom, when\nthe judge himself is dragged to the bar? But it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild\nlooking sky; and the air smells now, as if it blew from a far-away meadow; they\nhave been making hay somewhere under the slopes of the Andes, Starbuck, and the\nmowers are sleeping among the new-mown hay. Sleeping? Aye, toil we how we may,\nwe all sleep at last on the field. Sleep? Aye, and rust amid greenness; as last\nyear’s scythes flung down, and left in the half-cut swaths—Starbuck!”\n\nBut blanched to a corpse’s hue with despair, the Mate had stolen away.\n\nAhab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side; but started at two\nreflected, fixed eyes in the water there. Fedallah was motionlessly leaning over\nthe same rail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 133. THE CHASE—FIRST DAY.\n\nThat night, in the mid-watch, when the old man—as his wont at intervals—stepped\nforth from the scuttle in which he leaned, and went to his pivot-hole, he\nsuddenly thrust out his face fiercely, snuffing up the sea air as a sagacious\nship’s dog will, in drawing nigh to some barbarous isle. He declared that a\nwhale must be near. Soon that peculiar odor, sometimes to a great distance given\nforth by the living sperm whale, was palpable to all the watch; nor was any\nmariner surprised when, after inspecting the compass, and then the dog-vane, and\nthen ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as nearly as possible, Ahab\nrapidly ordered the ship’s course to be slightly altered, and the sail to be\nshortened.\n\nThe acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated at\ndaybreak, by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and lengthwise ahead,\nsmooth as oil, and resembling in the pleated watery wrinkles bordering it, the\npolished metallic-like marks of some swift tide-rip, at the mouth of a deep,\nrapid stream.\n\n“Man the mast-heads! Call all hands!”\n\nThundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the forecastle deck,\nDaggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps that they seemed to exhale\nfrom the scuttle, so instantaneously did they appear with their clothes in their\nhands.\n\n“What d’ye see?” cried Ahab, flattening his face to the sky.\n\n“Nothing, nothing sir!” was the sound hailing down in reply.\n\n“T’gallant sails!—stunsails! alow and aloft, and on both sides!”\n\nAll sail being set, he now cast loose the life-line, reserved for swaying him to\nthe main royal-mast head; and in a few moments they were hoisting him thither,\nwhen, while but two thirds of the way aloft, and while peering ahead through the\nhorizontal vacancy between the main-top-sail and top-gallant-sail, he raised a\ngull-like cry in the air. “There she blows!—there she blows! A hump like a\nsnow-hill! It is Moby Dick!”\n\nFired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three look-outs,\nthe men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous whale they had so\nlong been pursuing. Ahab had now gained his final perch, some feet above the\nother look-outs, Tashtego standing just beneath him on the cap of the\ntop-gallant-mast, so that the Indian’s head was almost on a level with Ahab’s\nheel. From this height the whale was now seen some mile or so ahead, at every\nroll of the sea revealing his high sparkling hump, and regularly jetting his\nsilent spout into the air. To the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent\nspout they had so long ago beheld in the moonlit Atlantic and Indian Oceans.\n\n“And did none of ye see it before?” cried Ahab, hailing the perched men all\naround him.\n\n“I saw him almost that same instant, sir, that Captain Ahab did, and I cried\nout,” said Tashtego.\n\n“Not the same instant; not the same—no, the doubloon is mine, Fate reserved the\ndoubloon for me. I only; none of ye could have raised the White Whale first.\nThere she blows!—there she blows!—there she blows! There again!—there again!” he\ncried, in long-drawn, lingering, methodic tones, attuned to the gradual\nprolongings of the whale’s visible jets. “He’s going to sound! In stunsails!\nDown top-gallant-sails! Stand by three boats. Mr. Starbuck, remember, stay on\nboard, and keep the ship. Helm there! Luff, luff a point! So; steady, man,\nsteady! There go flukes! No, no; only black water! All ready the boats there?\nStand by, stand by! Lower me, Mr. Starbuck; lower, lower,—quick, quicker!” and\nhe slid through the air to the deck.\n\n“He is heading straight to leeward, sir,” cried Stubb, “right away from us;\ncannot have seen the ship yet.”\n\n“Be dumb, man! Stand by the braces! Hard down the helm!—brace up! Shiver\nher!—shiver her!—So; well that! Boats, boats!”\n\nSoon all the boats but Starbuck’s were dropped; all the boat-sails set—all the\npaddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to leeward; and Ahab heading\nthe onset. A pale, death-glimmer lit up Fedallah’s sunken eyes; a hideous motion\ngnawed his mouth.\n\nLike noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped through the sea; but only\nslowly they neared the foe. As they neared him, the ocean grew still more\nsmooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves; seemed a noon-meadow, so\nserenely it spread. At length the breathless hunter came so nigh his seemingly\nunsuspecting prey, that his entire dazzling hump was distinctly visible, sliding\nalong the sea as if an isolated thing, and continually set in a revolving ring\nof finest, fleecy, greenish foam. He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of the\nslightly projecting head beyond. Before it, far out on the soft Turkish-rugged\nwaters, went the glistening white shadow from his broad, milky forehead, a\nmusical rippling playfully accompanying the shade; and behind, the blue waters\ninterchangeably flowed over into the moving valley of his steady wake; and on\neither hand bright bubbles arose and danced by his side. But these were broken\nagain by the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea,\nalternate with their fitful flight; and like to some flag-staff rising from the\npainted hull of an argosy, the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance\nprojected from the white whale’s back; and at intervals one of the cloud of\nsoft-toed fowls hovering, and to and fro skimming like a canopy over the fish,\nsilently perched and rocked on this pole, the long tail feathers streaming like\npennons.\n\nA gentle joyousness—a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness, invested the\ngliding whale. Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away with ravished Europa\nclinging to his graceful horns; his lovely, leering eyes sideways intent upon\nthe maid; with smooth bewitching fleetness, rippling straight for the nuptial\nbower in Crete; not Jove, not that great majesty Supreme! did surpass the\nglorified White Whale as he so divinely swam.\n\nOn each soft side—coincident with the parted swell, that but once leaving him,\nthen flowed so wide away—on each bright side, the whale shed off enticings. No\nwonder there had been some among the hunters who namelessly transported and\nallured by all this serenity, had ventured to assail it; but had fatally found\nthat quietude but the vesture of tornadoes. Yet calm, enticing calm, oh, whale!\nthou glidest on, to all who for the first time eye thee, no matter how many in\nthat same way thou may’st have bejuggled and destroyed before.\n\nAnd thus, through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea, among waves\nwhose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture, Moby Dick moved on,\nstill withholding from sight the full terrors of his submerged trunk, entirely\nhiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw. But soon the fore part of him slowly\nrose from the water; for an instant his whole marbleized body formed a high\narch, like Virginia’s Natural Bridge, and warningly waving his bannered flukes\nin the air, the grand god revealed himself, sounded, and went out of sight.\nHoveringly halting, and dipping on the wing, the white sea-fowls longingly\nlingered over the agitated pool that he left.\n\nWith oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails adrift, the three\nboats now stilly floated, awaiting Moby Dick’s reappearance.\n\n“An hour,” said Ahab, standing rooted in his boat’s stern; and he gazed beyond\nthe whale’s place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing vacancies to\nleeward. It was only an instant; for again his eyes seemed whirling round in his\nhead as he swept the watery circle. The breeze now freshened; the sea began to\nswell.\n\n“The birds!—the birds!” cried Tashtego.\n\nIn long Indian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds were now all\nflying towards Ahab’s boat; and when within a few yards began fluttering over\nthe water there, wheeling round and round, with joyous, expectant cries. Their\nvision was keener than man’s; Ahab could discover no sign in the sea. But\nsuddenly as he peered down and down into its depths, he profoundly saw a white\nliving spot no bigger than a white weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and\nmagnifying as it rose, till it turned, and then there were plainly revealed two\nlong crooked rows of white, glistening teeth, floating up from the\nundiscoverable bottom. It was Moby Dick’s open mouth and scrolled jaw; his vast,\nshadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea. The glittering mouth\nyawned beneath the boat like an open-doored marble tomb; and giving one sidelong\nsweep with his steering oar, Ahab whirled the craft aside from this tremendous\napparition. Then, calling upon Fedallah to change places with him, went forward\nto the bows, and seizing Perth’s harpoon, commanded his crew to grasp their oars\nand stand by to stern.\n\nNow, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis, its bow, by\nanticipation, was made to face the whale’s head while yet under water. But as if\nperceiving this stratagem, Moby Dick, with that malicious intelligence ascribed\nto him, sidelingly transplanted himself, as it were, in an instant, shooting his\npleated head lengthwise beneath the boat.\n\nThrough and through; through every plank and each rib, it thrilled for an\ninstant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner of a biting shark,\nslowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his mouth, so that the long,\nnarrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high up into the open air, and one of the\nteeth caught in a row-lock. The bluish pearl-white of the inside of the jaw was\nwithin six inches of Ahab’s head, and reached higher than that. In this attitude\nthe White Whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse. With\nunastonished eyes Fedallah gazed, and crossed his arms; but the tiger-yellow\ncrew were tumbling over each other’s heads to gain the uttermost stern.\n\nAnd now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as the whale\ndallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and from his body being\nsubmerged beneath the boat, he could not be darted at from the bows, for the\nbows were almost inside of him, as it were; and while the other boats\ninvoluntarily paused, as before a quick crisis impossible to withstand, then it\nwas that monomaniac Ahab, furious with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe,\nwhich placed him all alive and helpless in the very jaws he hated; frenzied with\nall this, he seized the long bone with his naked hands, and wildly strove to\nwrench it from its gripe. As now he thus vainly strove, the jaw slipped from\nhim; the frail gunwales bent in, collapsed, and snapped, as both jaws, like an\nenormous shears, sliding further aft, bit the craft completely in twain, and\nlocked themselves fast again in the sea, midway between the two floating wrecks.\nThese floated aside, the broken ends drooping, the crew at the stern-wreck\nclinging to the gunwales, and striving to hold fast to the oars to lash them\nacross.\n\nAt that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the first to\nperceive the whale’s intent, by the crafty upraising of his head, a movement\nthat loosed his hold for the time; at that moment his hand had made one final\neffort to push the boat out of the bite. But only slipping further into the\nwhale’s mouth, and tilting over sideways as it slipped, the boat had shaken off\nhis hold on the jaw; spilled him out of it, as he leaned to the push; and so he\nfell flat-faced upon the sea.\n\nRipplingly withdrawing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a little distance,\nvertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the billows; and at\nthe same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body; so that when his vast\nwrinkled forehead rose—some twenty or more feet out of the water—the now rising\nswells, with all their confluent waves, dazzlingly broke against it;\nvindictively tossing their shivered spray still higher into the air.* So, in a\ngale, the but half baffled Channel billows only recoil from the base of the\nEddystone, triumphantly to overleap its summit with their scud.\n\n*This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale. It receives its designation\n(pitchpoling) from its being likened to that preliminary up-and-down poise of\nthe whale-lance, in the exercise called pitchpoling, previously described. By\nthis motion the whale must best and most comprehensively view whatever objects\nmay be encircling him.\n\nBut soon resuming his horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam swiftly round and\nround the wrecked crew; sideways churning the water in his vengeful wake, as if\nlashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault. The sight of the\nsplintered boat seemed to madden him, as the blood of grapes and mulberries cast\nbefore Antiochus’s elephants in the book of Maccabees. Meanwhile Ahab half\nsmothered in the foam of the whale’s insolent tail, and too much of a cripple to\nswim,—though he could still keep afloat, even in the heart of such a whirlpool\nas that; helpless Ahab’s head was seen, like a tossed bubble which the least\nchance shock might burst. From the boat’s fragmentary stern, Fedallah\nincuriously and mildly eyed him; the clinging crew, at the other drifting end,\ncould not succor him; more than enough was it for them to look to themselves.\nFor so revolvingly appalling was the White Whale’s aspect, and so planetarily\nswift the ever-contracting circles he made, that he seemed horizontally swooping\nupon them. And though the other boats, unharmed, still hovered hard by; still\nthey dared not pull into the eddy to strike, lest that should be the signal for\nthe instant destruction of the jeopardized castaways, Ahab and all; nor in that\ncase could they themselves hope to escape. With straining eyes, then, they\nremained on the outer edge of the direful zone, whose centre had now become the\nold man’s head.\n\nMeantime, from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship’s mast\nheads; and squaring her yards, she had borne down upon the scene; and was now so\nnigh, that Ahab in the water hailed her!—“Sail on the”—but that moment a\nbreaking sea dashed on him from Moby Dick, and whelmed him for the time. But\nstruggling out of it again, and chancing to rise on a towering crest, he\nshouted,—“Sail on the whale!—Drive him off!”\n\nThe Pequod’s prows were pointed; and breaking up the charmed circle, she\neffectually parted the white whale from his victim. As he sullenly swam off, the\nboats flew to the rescue.\n\nDragged into Stubb’s boat with blood-shot, blinded eyes, the white brine caking\nin his wrinkles; the long tension of Ahab’s bodily strength did crack, and\nhelplessly he yielded to his body’s doom: for a time, lying all crushed in the\nbottom of Stubb’s boat, like one trodden under foot of herds of elephants. Far\ninland, nameless wails came from him, as desolate sounds from out ravines.\n\nBut this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more\nabbreviate it. In an instant’s compass, great hearts sometimes condense to one\ndeep pang, the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused through feebler\nmen’s whole lives. And so, such hearts, though summary in each one suffering;\nstill, if the gods decree it, in their life-time aggregate a whole age of woe,\nwholly made up of instantaneous intensities; for even in their pointless\ncentres, those noble natures contain the entire circumferences of inferior\nsouls.\n\n“The harpoon,” said Ahab, half way rising, and draggingly leaning on one bended\narm—“is it safe?”\n\n“Aye, sir, for it was not darted; this is it,” said Stubb, showing it.\n\n“Lay it before me;—any missing men?”\n\n“One, two, three, four, five;—there were five oars, sir, and here are five men.”\n\n“That’s good.—Help me, man; I wish to stand. So, so, I see him! there! there!\ngoing to leeward still; what a leaping spout!—Hands off from me! The eternal sap\nruns up in Ahab’s bones again! Set the sail; out oars; the helm!”\n\nIt is often the case that when a boat is stove, its crew, being picked up by\nanother boat, help to work that second boat; and the chase is thus continued\nwith what is called double-banked oars. It was thus now. But the added power of\nthe boat did not equal the added power of the whale, for he seemed to have\ntreble-banked his every fin; swimming with a velocity which plainly showed, that\nif now, under these circumstances, pushed on, the chase would prove an\nindefinitely prolonged, if not a hopeless one; nor could any crew endure for so\nlong a period, such an unintermitted, intense straining at the oar; a thing\nbarely tolerable only in some one brief vicissitude. The ship itself, then, as\nit sometimes happens, offered the most promising intermediate means of\novertaking the chase. Accordingly, the boats now made for her, and were soon\nswayed up to their cranes—the two parts of the wrecked boat having been\npreviously secured by her—and then hoisting everything to her side, and stacking\nher canvas high up, and sideways outstretching it with stun-sails, like the\ndouble-jointed wings of an albatross; the Pequod bore down in the leeward wake\nof Moby-Dick. At the well known, methodic intervals, the whale’s glittering\nspout was regularly announced from the manned mast-heads; and when he would be\nreported as just gone down, Ahab would take the time, and then pacing the deck,\nbinnacle-watch in hand, so soon as the last second of the allotted hour expired,\nhis voice was heard.—“Whose is the doubloon now? D’ye see him?” and if the reply\nwas, No, sir! straightway he commanded them to lift him to his perch. In this\nway the day wore on; Ahab, now aloft and motionless; anon, unrestingly pacing\nthe planks.\n\nAs he was thus walking, uttering no sound, except to hail the men aloft, or to\nbid them hoist a sail still higher, or to spread one to a still greater\nbreadth—thus to and fro pacing, beneath his slouched hat, at every turn he\npassed his own wrecked boat, which had been dropped upon the quarter-deck, and\nlay there reversed; broken bow to shattered stern. At last he paused before it;\nand as in an already over-clouded sky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes sail\nacross, so over the old man’s face there now stole some such added gloom as\nthis.\n\nStubb saw him pause; and perhaps intending, not vainly, though, to evince his\nown unabated fortitude, and thus keep up a valiant place in his Captain’s mind,\nhe advanced, and eyeing the wreck exclaimed—“The thistle the ass refused; it\npricked his mouth too keenly, sir; ha! ha!”\n\n“What soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck? Man, man! did I not\nknow thee brave as fearless fire (and as mechanical) I could swear thou wert a\npoltroon. Groan nor laugh should be heard before a wreck.”\n\n“Aye, sir,” said Starbuck drawing near, “’tis a solemn sight; an omen, and an\nill one.”\n\n“Omen? omen?—the dictionary! If the gods think to speak outright to man, they\nwill honorably speak outright; not shake their heads, and give an old wives’\ndarkling hint.—Begone! Ye two are the opposite poles of one thing; Starbuck is\nStubb reversed, and Stubb is Starbuck; and ye two are all mankind; and Ahab\nstands alone among the millions of the peopled earth, nor gods nor men his\nneighbors! Cold, cold—I shiver!—How now? Aloft there! D’ye see him? Sing out for\nevery spout, though he spout ten times a second!”\n\nThe day was nearly done; only the hem of his golden robe was rustling. Soon, it\nwas almost dark, but the look-out men still remained unset.\n\n“Can’t see the spout now, sir;—too dark”—cried a voice from the air.\n\n“How heading when last seen?”\n\n“As before, sir,—straight to leeward.”\n\n“Good! he will travel slower now ’tis night. Down royals and top-gallant\nstun-sails, Mr. Starbuck. We must not run over him before morning; he’s making a\npassage now, and may heave-to a while. Helm there! keep her full before the\nwind!—Aloft! come down!—Mr. Stubb, send a fresh hand to the fore-mast head, and\nsee it manned till morning.”—Then advancing towards the doubloon in the\nmain-mast—“Men, this gold is mine, for I earned it; but I shall let it abide\nhere till the White Whale is dead; and then, whosoever of ye first raises him,\nupon the day he shall be killed, this gold is that man’s; and if on that day I\nshall again raise him, then, ten times its sum shall be divided among all of ye!\nAway now!—the deck is thine, sir!”\n\nAnd so saying, he placed himself half way within the scuttle, and slouching his\nhat, stood there till dawn, except when at intervals rousing himself to see how\nthe night wore on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 134. THE CHASE—SECOND DAY.\n\nAt day-break, the three mast-heads were punctually manned afresh.\n\n“D’ye see him?” cried Ahab after allowing a little space for the light to\nspread.\n\n“See nothing, sir.”\n\n“Turn up all hands and make sail! he travels faster than I thought for;—the\ntop-gallant sails!—aye, they should have been kept on her all night. But no\nmatter—’tis but resting for the rush.”\n\nHere be it said, that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular whale,\ncontinued through day into night, and through night into day, is a thing by no\nmeans unprecedented in the South sea fishery. For such is the wonderful skill,\nprescience of experience, and invincible confidence acquired by some great\nnatural geniuses among the Nantucket commanders; that from the simple\nobservation of a whale when last descried, they will, under certain given\ncircumstances, pretty accurately foretell both the direction in which he will\ncontinue to swim for a time, while out of sight, as well as his probable rate of\nprogression during that period. And, in these cases, somewhat as a pilot, when\nabout losing sight of a coast, whose general trending he well knows, and which\nhe desires shortly to return to again, but at some further point; like as this\npilot stands by his compass, and takes the precise bearing of the cape at\npresent visible, in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote, unseen\nheadland, eventually to be visited: so does the fisherman, at his compass, with\nthe whale; for after being chased, and diligently marked, through several hours\nof daylight, then, when night obscures the fish, the creature’s future wake\nthrough the darkness is almost as established to the sagacious mind of the\nhunter, as the pilot’s coast is to him. So that to this hunter’s wondrous skill,\nthe proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in water, a wake, is to all desired\npurposes well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land. And as the mighty iron\nLeviathan of the modern railway is so familiarly known in its every pace, that,\nwith watches in their hands, men time his rate as doctors that of a baby’s\npulse; and lightly say of it, the up train or the down train will reach such or\nsuch a spot, at such or such an hour; even so, almost, there are occasions when\nthese Nantucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep, according to the\nobserved humor of his speed; and say to themselves, so many hours hence this\nwhale will have gone two hundred miles, will have about reached this or that\ndegree of latitude or longitude. But to render this acuteness at all successful\nin the end, the wind and the sea must be the whaleman’s allies; for of what\npresent avail to the becalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that assures him\nhe is exactly ninety-three leagues and a quarter from his port? Inferable from\nthese statements, are many collateral subtile matters touching the chase of\nwhales.\n\nThe ship tore on; leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a cannon-ball,\nmissent, becomes a plough-share and turns up the level field.\n\n“By salt and hemp!” cried Stubb, “but this swift motion of the deck creeps up\none’s legs and tingles at the heart. This ship and I are two brave fellows!—Ha,\nha! Some one take me up, and launch me, spine-wise, on the sea,—for by\nlive-oaks! my spine’s a keel. Ha, ha! we go the gait that leaves no dust\nbehind!”\n\n“There she blows—she blows!—she blows!—right ahead!” was now the mast-head cry.\n\n“Aye, aye!” cried Stubb, “I knew it—ye can’t escape—blow on and split your\nspout, O whale! the mad fiend himself is after ye! blow your trump—blister your\nlungs!—Ahab will dam off your blood, as a miller shuts his watergate upon the\nstream!”\n\nAnd Stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew. The frenzies of the\nchase had by this time worked them bubblingly up, like old wine worked anew.\nWhatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might have felt before; these\nwere not only now kept out of sight through the growing awe of Ahab, but they\nwere broken up, and on all sides routed, as timid prairie hares that scatter\nbefore the bounding bison. The hand of Fate had snatched all their souls; and by\nthe stirring perils of the previous day; the rack of the past night’s suspense;\nthe fixed, unfearing, blind, reckless way in which their wild craft went\nplunging towards its flying mark; by all these things, their hearts were bowled\nalong. The wind that made great bellies of their sails, and rushed the vessel on\nby arms invisible as irresistible; this seemed the symbol of that unseen agency\nwhich so enslaved them to the race.\n\nThey were one man, not thirty. For as the one ship that held them all; though it\nwas put together of all contrasting things—oak, and maple, and pine wood; iron,\nand pitch, and hemp—yet all these ran into each other in the one concrete hull,\nwhich shot on its way, both balanced and directed by the long central keel; even\nso, all the individualities of the crew, this man’s valor, that man’s fear;\nguilt and guiltiness, all varieties were welded into oneness, and were all\ndirected to that fatal goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did point to.\n\nThe rigging lived. The mast-heads, like the tops of tall palms, were\noutspreadingly tufted with arms and legs. Clinging to a spar with one hand, some\nreached forth the other with impatient wavings; others, shading their eyes from\nthe vivid sunlight, sat far out on the rocking yards; all the spars in full\nbearing of mortals, ready and ripe for their fate. Ah! how they still strove\nthrough that infinite blueness to seek out the thing that might destroy them!\n\n“Why sing ye not out for him, if ye see him?” cried Ahab, when, after the lapse\nof some minutes since the first cry, no more had been heard. “Sway me up, men;\nye have been deceived; not Moby Dick casts one odd jet that way, and then\ndisappears.”\n\nIt was even so; in their headlong eagerness, the men had mistaken some other\nthing for the whale-spout, as the event itself soon proved; for hardly had Ahab\nreached his perch; hardly was the rope belayed to its pin on deck, when he\nstruck the key-note to an orchestra, that made the air vibrate as with the\ncombined discharges of rifles. The triumphant halloo of thirty buckskin lungs\nwas heard, as—much nearer to the ship than the place of the imaginary jet, less\nthan a mile ahead—Moby Dick bodily burst into view! For not by any calm and\nindolent spoutings; not by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his\nhead, did the White Whale now reveal his vicinity; but by the far more wondrous\nphenomenon of breaching. Rising with his utmost velocity from the furthest\ndepths, the Sperm Whale thus booms his entire bulk into the pure element of air,\nand piling up a mountain of dazzling foam, shows his place to the distance of\nseven miles and more. In those moments, the torn, enraged waves he shakes off,\nseem his mane; in some cases, this breaching is his act of defiance.\n\n“There she breaches! there she breaches!” was the cry, as in his immeasurable\nbravadoes the White Whale tossed himself salmon-like to Heaven. So suddenly seen\nin the blue plain of the sea, and relieved against the still bluer margin of the\nsky, the spray that he raised, for the moment, intolerably glittered and glared\nlike a glacier; and stood there gradually fading and fading away from its first\nsparkling intensity, to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale.\n\n“Aye, breach your last to the sun, Moby Dick!” cried Ahab, “thy hour and thy\nharpoon are at hand!—Down! down all of ye, but one man at the fore. The\nboats!—stand by!”\n\nUnmindful of the tedious rope-ladders of the shrouds, the men, like shooting\nstars, slid to the deck, by the isolated backstays and halyards; while Ahab,\nless dartingly, but still rapidly was dropped from his perch.\n\n“Lower away,” he cried, so soon as he had reached his boat—a spare one, rigged\nthe afternoon previous. “Mr. Starbuck, the ship is thine—keep away from the\nboats, but keep near them. Lower, all!”\n\nAs if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the first assailant\nhimself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now coming for the three crews. Ahab’s\nboat was central; and cheering his men, he told them he would take the whale\nhead-and-head,—that is, pull straight up to his forehead,—a not uncommon thing;\nfor when within a certain limit, such a course excludes the coming onset from\nthe whale’s sidelong vision. But ere that close limit was gained, and while yet\nall three boats were plain as the ship’s three masts to his eye; the White Whale\nchurning himself into furious speed, almost in an instant as it were, rushing\namong the boats with open jaws, and a lashing tail, offered appalling battle on\nevery side; and heedless of the irons darted at him from every boat, seemed only\nintent on annihilating each separate plank of which those boats were made. But\nskilfully manœuvred, incessantly wheeling like trained chargers in the field;\nthe boats for a while eluded him; though, at times, but by a plank’s breadth;\nwhile all the time, Ahab’s unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to\nshreds.\n\nBut at last in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so crossed and\nrecrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three lines now\nfast to him, that they foreshortened, and, of themselves, warped the devoted\nboats towards the planted irons in him; though now for a moment the whale drew\naside a little, as if to rally for a more tremendous charge. Seizing that\nopportunity, Ahab first paid out more line: and then was rapidly hauling and\njerking in upon it again—hoping that way to disencumber it of some snarls—when\nlo!—a sight more savage than the embattled teeth of sharks!\n\nCaught and twisted—corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose harpoons and\nlances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came flashing and dripping up\nto the chocks in the bows of Ahab’s boat. Only one thing could be done. Seizing\nthe boat-knife, he critically reached within—through—and then, without—the rays\nof steel; dragged in the line beyond, passed it, inboard, to the bowsman, and\nthen, twice sundering the rope near the chocks—dropped the intercepted fagot of\nsteel into the sea; and was all fast again. That instant, the White Whale made a\nsudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other lines; by so doing,\nirresistibly dragged the more involved boats of Stubb and Flask towards his\nflukes; dashed them together like two rolling husks on a surf-beaten beach, and\nthen, diving down into the sea, disappeared in a boiling maelstrom, in which,\nfor a space, the odorous cedar chips of the wrecks danced round and round, like\nthe grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred bowl of punch.\n\nWhile the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out after the\nrevolving line-tubs, oars, and other floating furniture, while aslope little\nFlask bobbed up and down like an empty vial, twitching his legs upwards to\nescape the dreaded jaws of sharks; and Stubb was lustily singing out for some\none to ladle him up; and while the old man’s line—now parting—admitted of his\npulling into the creamy pool to rescue whom he could;—in that wild\nsimultaneousness of a thousand concreted perils,—Ahab’s yet unstricken boat\nseemed drawn up towards Heaven by invisible wires,—as, arrow-like, shooting\nperpendicularly from the sea, the White Whale dashed his broad forehead against\nits bottom, and sent it, turning over and over, into the air; till it fell\nagain—gunwale downwards—and Ahab and his men struggled out from under it, like\nseals from a sea-side cave.\n\nThe first uprising momentum of the whale—modifying its direction as he struck\nthe surface—involuntarily launched him along it, to a little distance from the\ncentre of the destruction he had made; and with his back to it, he now lay for a\nmoment slowly feeling with his flukes from side to side; and whenever a stray\noar, bit of plank, the least chip or crumb of the boats touched his skin, his\ntail swiftly drew back, and came sideways smiting the sea. But soon, as if\nsatisfied that his work for that time was done, he pushed his pleated forehead\nthrough the ocean, and trailing after him the intertangled lines, continued his\nleeward way at a traveller’s methodic pace.\n\nAs before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again came\nbearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the floating\nmariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else could be caught at, and safely landed\nthem on her decks. Some sprained shoulders, wrists, and ankles; livid\ncontusions; wrenched harpoons and lances; inextricable intricacies of rope;\nshattered oars and planks; all these were there; but no fatal or even serious\nill seemed to have befallen any one. As with Fedallah the day before, so Ahab\nwas now found grimly clinging to his boat’s broken half, which afforded a\ncomparatively easy float; nor did it so exhaust him as the previous day’s\nmishap.\n\nBut when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him; as instead\nof standing by himself he still half-hung upon the shoulder of Starbuck, who had\nthus far been the foremost to assist him. His ivory leg had been snapped off,\nleaving but one short sharp splinter.\n\n“Aye, aye, Starbuck, ’tis sweet to lean sometimes, be the leaner who he will;\nand would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has.”\n\n“The ferrule has not stood, sir,” said the carpenter, now coming up; “I put good\nwork into that leg.”\n\n“But no bones broken, sir, I hope,” said Stubb with true concern.\n\n“Aye! and all splintered to pieces, Stubb!—d’ye see it.—But even with a broken\nbone, old Ahab is untouched; and I account no living bone of mine one jot more\nme, than this dead one that’s lost. Nor white whale, nor man, nor fiend, can so\nmuch as graze old Ahab in his own proper and inaccessible being. Can any lead\ntouch yonder floor, any mast scrape yonder roof?—Aloft there! which way?”\n\n“Dead to leeward, sir.”\n\n“Up helm, then; pile on the sail again, ship keepers! down the rest of the spare\nboats and rig them—Mr. Starbuck away, and muster the boat’s crews.”\n\n“Let me first help thee towards the bulwarks, sir.”\n\n“Oh, oh, oh! how this splinter gores me now! Accursed fate! that the\nunconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate!”\n\n“Sir?”\n\n“My body, man, not thee. Give me something for a cane—there, that shivered lance\nwill do. Muster the men. Surely I have not seen him yet. By heaven it cannot\nbe!—missing?—quick! call them all.”\n\nThe old man’s hinted thought was true. Upon mustering the company, the Parsee\nwas not there.\n\n“The Parsee!” cried Stubb—“he must have been caught in——”\n\n“The black vomit wrench thee!—run all of ye above, alow, cabin, forecastle—find\nhim—not gone—not gone!”\n\nBut quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the Parsee was nowhere to\nbe found.\n\n“Aye, sir,” said Stubb—“caught among the tangles of your line—I thought I saw\nhim dragging under.”\n\n“My line! my line? Gone?—gone? What means that little word?—What death-knell\nrings in it, that old Ahab shakes as if he were the belfry. The harpoon,\ntoo!—toss over the litter there,—d’ye see it?—the forged iron, men, the white\nwhale’s—no, no, no,—blistered fool! this hand did dart it!—’tis in the\nfish!—Aloft there! Keep him nailed—Quick!—all hands to the rigging of the\nboats—collect the oars—harpooneers! the irons, the irons!—hoist the royals\nhigher—a pull on all the sheets!—helm there! steady, steady for your life! I’ll\nten times girdle the unmeasured globe; yea and dive straight through it, but\nI’ll slay him yet!”\n\n“Great God! but for one single instant show thyself,” cried Starbuck; “never,\nnever wilt thou capture him, old man—In Jesus’ name no more of this, that’s\nworse than devil’s madness. Two days chased; twice stove to splinters; thy very\nleg once more snatched from under thee; thy evil shadow gone—all good angels\nmobbing thee with warnings:—what more wouldst thou have?—Shall we keep chasing\nthis murderous fish till he swamps the last man? Shall we be dragged by him to\nthe bottom of the sea? Shall we be towed by him to the infernal world? Oh,\noh,—Impiety and blasphemy to hunt him more!”\n\n“Starbuck, of late I’ve felt strangely moved to thee; ever since that hour we\nboth saw—thou know’st what, in one another’s eyes. But in this matter of the\nwhale, be the front of thy face to me as the palm of this hand—a lipless,\nunfeatured blank. Ahab is for ever Ahab, man. This whole act’s immutably\ndecreed. ’Twas rehearsed by thee and me a billion years before this ocean\nrolled. Fool! I am the Fates’ lieutenant; I act under orders. Look thou,\nunderling! that thou obeyest mine.—Stand round me, men. Ye see an old man cut\ndown to the stump; leaning on a shivered lance; propped up on a lonely foot.\n’Tis Ahab—his body’s part; but Ahab’s soul’s a centipede, that moves upon a\nhundred legs. I feel strained, half stranded, as ropes that tow dismasted\nfrigates in a gale; and I may look so. But ere I break, ye’ll hear me crack; and\ntill ye hear that, know that Ahab’s hawser tows his purpose yet. Believe ye,\nmen, in the things called omens? Then laugh aloud, and cry encore! For ere they\ndrown, drowning things will twice rise to the surface; then rise again, to sink\nfor evermore. So with Moby Dick—two days he’s floated—tomorrow will be the\nthird. Aye, men, he’ll rise once more,—but only to spout his last! D’ye feel\nbrave men, brave?”\n\n“As fearless fire,” cried Stubb.\n\n“And as mechanical,” muttered Ahab. Then as the men went forward, he muttered\non: “The things called omens! And yesterday I talked the same to Starbuck there,\nconcerning my broken boat. Oh! how valiantly I seek to drive out of others’\nhearts what’s clinched so fast in mine!—The Parsee—the Parsee!—gone, gone? and\nhe was to go before:—but still was to be seen again ere I could perish—How’s\nthat?—There’s a riddle now might baffle all the lawyers backed by the ghosts of\nthe whole line of judges:—like a hawk’s beak it pecks my brain. I’ll, I’ll solve\nit, though!”\n\nWhen dusk descended, the whale was still in sight to leeward.\n\nSo once more the sail was shortened, and everything passed nearly as on the\nprevious night; only, the sound of hammers, and the hum of the grindstone was\nheard till nearly daylight, as the men toiled by lanterns in the complete and\ncareful rigging of the spare boats and sharpening their fresh weapons for the\nmorrow. Meantime, of the broken keel of Ahab’s wrecked craft the carpenter made\nhim another leg; while still as on the night before, slouched Ahab stood fixed\nwithin his scuttle; his hid, heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on\nits dial; sat due eastward for the earliest sun.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 135. THE CHASE.—THIRD DAY.\n\nThe morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh, and once more the solitary\nnight-man at the fore-mast-head was relieved by crowds of the daylight\nlook-outs, who dotted every mast and almost every spar.\n\n“D’ye see him?” cried Ahab; but the whale was not yet in sight.\n\n“In his infallible wake, though; but follow that wake, that’s all. Helm there;\nsteady, as thou goest, and hast been going. What a lovely day again! were it a\nnew-made world, and made for a summer-house to the angels, and this morning the\nfirst of its throwing open to them, a fairer day could not dawn upon that world.\nHere’s food for thought, had Ahab time to think; but Ahab never thinks; he only\nfeels, feels, feels; that’s tingling enough for mortal man! to think’s audacity.\nGod only has that right and privilege. Thinking is, or ought to be, a coolness\nand a calmness; and our poor hearts throb, and our poor brains beat too much for\nthat. And yet, I’ve sometimes thought my brain was very calm—frozen calm, this\nold skull cracks so, like a glass in which the contents turned to ice, and\nshiver it. And still this hair is growing now; this moment growing, and heat\nmust breed it; but no, it’s like that sort of common grass that will grow\nanywhere, between the earthy clefts of Greenland ice or in Vesuvius lava. How\nthe wild winds blow it; they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails\nlash the tossed ship they cling to. A vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this\nthrough prison corridors and cells, and wards of hospitals, and ventilated them,\nand now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces. Out upon it!—it’s tainted.\nWere I the wind, I’d blow no more on such a wicked, miserable world. I’d crawl\nsomewhere to a cave, and slink there. And yet, ’tis a noble and heroic thing,\nthe wind! who ever conquered it? In every fight it has the last and bitterest\nblow. Run tilting at it, and you but run through it. Ha! a coward wind that\nstrikes stark naked men, but will not stand to receive a single blow. Even Ahab\nis a braver thing—a nobler thing than that. Would now the wind but had a body;\nbut all the things that most exasperate and outrage mortal man, all these things\nare bodiless, but only bodiless as objects, not as agents. There’s a most\nspecial, a most cunning, oh, a most malicious difference! And yet, I say again,\nand swear it now, that there’s something all glorious and gracious in the wind.\nThese warm Trade Winds, at least, that in the clear heavens blow straight on, in\nstrong and steadfast, vigorous mildness; and veer not from their mark, however\nthe baser currents of the sea may turn and tack, and mightiest Mississippies of\nthe land swift and swerve about, uncertain where to go at last. And by the\neternal Poles! these same Trades that so directly blow my good ship on; these\nTrades, or something like them—something so unchangeable, and full as strong,\nblow my keeled soul along! To it! Aloft there! What d’ye see?”\n\n“Nothing, sir.”\n\n“Nothing! and noon at hand! The doubloon goes a-begging! See the sun! Aye, aye,\nit must be so. I’ve oversailed him. How, got the start? Aye, he’s chasing me\nnow; not I, him—that’s bad; I might have known it, too. Fool! the lines—the\nharpoons he’s towing. Aye, aye, I have run him by last night. About! about! Come\ndown, all of ye, but the regular look outs! Man the braces!”\n\nSteering as she had done, the wind had been somewhat on the Pequod’s quarter, so\nthat now being pointed in the reverse direction, the braced ship sailed hard\nupon the breeze as she rechurned the cream in her own white wake.\n\n“Against the wind he now steers for the open jaw,” murmured Starbuck to himself,\nas he coiled the new-hauled main-brace upon the rail. “God keep us, but already\nmy bones feel damp within me, and from the inside wet my flesh. I misdoubt me\nthat I disobey my God in obeying him!”\n\n“Stand by to sway me up!” cried Ahab, advancing to the hempen basket. “We should\nmeet him soon.”\n\n“Aye, aye, sir,” and straightway Starbuck did Ahab’s bidding, and once more Ahab\nswung on high.\n\nA whole hour now passed; gold-beaten out to ages. Time itself now held long\nbreaths with keen suspense. But at last, some three points off the weather bow,\nAhab descried the spout again, and instantly from the three mast-heads three\nshrieks went up as if the tongues of fire had voiced it.\n\n“Forehead to forehead I meet thee, this third time, Moby Dick! On deck\nthere!—brace sharper up; crowd her into the wind’s eye. He’s too far off to\nlower yet, Mr. Starbuck. The sails shake! Stand over that helmsman with a\ntop-maul! So, so; he travels fast, and I must down. But let me have one more\ngood round look aloft here at the sea; there’s time for that. An old, old sight,\nand yet somehow so young; aye, and not changed a wink since I first saw it, a\nboy, from the sand-hills of Nantucket! The same!—the same!—the same to Noah as\nto me. There’s a soft shower to leeward. Such lovely leewardings! They must lead\nsomewhere—to something else than common land, more palmy than the palms.\nLeeward! the white whale goes that way; look to windward, then; the better if\nthe bitterer quarter. But good bye, good bye, old mast-head! What’s this?—green?\naye, tiny mosses in these warped cracks. No such green weather stains on Ahab’s\nhead! There’s the difference now between man’s old age and matter’s. But aye,\nold mast, we both grow old together; sound in our hulls, though, are we not, my\nship? Aye, minus a leg, that’s all. By heaven this dead wood has the better of\nmy live flesh every way. I can’t compare with it; and I’ve known some ships made\nof dead trees outlast the lives of men made of the most vital stuff of vital\nfathers. What’s that he said? he should still go before me, my pilot; and yet to\nbe seen again? But where? Will I have eyes at the bottom of the sea, supposing I\ndescend those endless stairs? and all night I’ve been sailing from him, wherever\nhe did sink to. Aye, aye, like many more thou told’st direful truth as touching\nthyself, O Parsee; but, Ahab, there thy shot fell short. Good-bye,\nmast-head—keep a good eye upon the whale, the while I’m gone. We’ll talk\nto-morrow, nay, to-night, when the white whale lies down there, tied by head and\ntail.”\n\nHe gave the word; and still gazing round him, was steadily lowered through the\ncloven blue air to the deck.\n\nIn due time the boats were lowered; but as standing in his shallop’s stern, Ahab\njust hovered upon the point of the descent, he waved to the mate,—who held one\nof the tackle-ropes on deck—and bade him pause.\n\n“Starbuck!”\n\n“Sir?”\n\n“For the third time my soul’s ship starts upon this voyage, Starbuck.”\n\n“Aye, sir, thou wilt have it so.”\n\n“Some ships sail from their ports, and ever afterwards are missing, Starbuck!”\n\n“Truth, sir: saddest truth.”\n\n“Some men die at ebb tide; some at low water; some at the full of the flood;—and\nI feel now like a billow that’s all one crested comb, Starbuck. I am old;—shake\nhands with me, man.”\n\nTheir hands met; their eyes fastened; Starbuck’s tears the glue.\n\n“Oh, my captain, my captain!—noble heart—go not—go not!—see, it’s a brave man\nthat weeps; how great the agony of the persuasion then!”\n\n“Lower away!”—cried Ahab, tossing the mate’s arm from him. “Stand by the crew!”\n\nIn an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern.\n\n“The sharks! the sharks!” cried a voice from the low cabin-window there; “O\nmaster, my master, come back!”\n\nBut Ahab heard nothing; for his own voice was high-lifted then; and the boat\nleaped on.\n\nYet the voice spake true; for scarce had he pushed from the ship, when numbers\nof sharks, seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneath the hull,\nmaliciously snapped at the blades of the oars, every time they dipped in the\nwater; and in this way accompanied the boat with their bites. It is a thing not\nuncommonly happening to the whale-boats in those swarming seas; the sharks at\ntimes apparently following them in the same prescient way that vultures hover\nover the banners of marching regiments in the east. But these were the first\nsharks that had been observed by the Pequod since the White Whale had been first\ndescried; and whether it was that Ahab’s crew were all such tiger-yellow\nbarbarians, and therefore their flesh more musky to the senses of the sharks—a\nmatter sometimes well known to affect them,—however it was, they seemed to\nfollow that one boat without molesting the others.\n\n“Heart of wrought steel!” murmured Starbuck gazing over the side, and following\nwith his eyes the receding boat—“canst thou yet ring boldly to that\nsight?—lowering thy keel among ravening sharks, and followed by them,\nopen-mouthed to the chase; and this the critical third day?—For when three days\nflow together in one continuous intense pursuit; be sure the first is the\nmorning, the second the noon, and the third the evening and the end of that\nthing—be that end what it may. Oh! my God! what is this that shoots through me,\nand leaves me so deadly calm, yet expectant,—fixed at the top of a shudder!\nFuture things swim before me, as in empty outlines and skeletons; all the past\nis somehow grown dim. Mary, girl! thou fadest in pale glories behind me; boy! I\nseem to see but thy eyes grown wondrous blue. Strangest problems of life seem\nclearing; but clouds sweep between—Is my journey’s end coming? My legs feel\nfaint; like his who has footed it all day. Feel thy heart,—beats it yet? Stir\nthyself, Starbuck!—stave it off—move, move! speak aloud!—Mast-head there! See ye\nmy boy’s hand on the hill?—Crazed;—aloft there!—keep thy keenest eye upon the\nboats:—mark well the whale!—Ho! again!—drive off that hawk! see! he pecks—he\ntears the vane”—pointing to the red flag flying at the main-truck—“Ha! he soars\naway with it!—Where’s the old man now? see’st thou that sight, oh Ahab!—shudder,\nshudder!”\n\nThe boats had not gone very far, when by a signal from the mast-heads—a downward\npointed arm, Ahab knew that the whale had sounded; but intending to be near him\nat the next rising, he held on his way a little sideways from the vessel; the\nbecharmed crew maintaining the profoundest silence, as the head-beat waves\nhammered and hammered against the opposing bow.\n\n“Drive, drive in your nails, oh ye waves! to their uttermost heads drive them\nin! ye but strike a thing without a lid; and no coffin and no hearse can be\nmine:—and hemp only can kill me! Ha! ha!”\n\nSuddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles; then quickly\nupheaved, as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of ice, swiftly rising to\nthe surface. A low rumbling sound was heard; a subterraneous hum; and then all\nheld their breaths; as bedraggled with trailing ropes, and harpoons, and lances,\na vast form shot lengthwise, but obliquely from the sea. Shrouded in a thin\ndrooping veil of mist, it hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air; and then\nfell swamping back into the deep. Crushed thirty feet upwards, the waters\nflashed for an instant like heaps of fountains, then brokenly sank in a shower\nof flakes, leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the marble\ntrunk of the whale.\n\n“Give way!” cried Ahab to the oarsmen, and the boats darted forward to the\nattack; but maddened by yesterday’s fresh irons that corroded in him, Moby Dick\nseemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell from heaven. The wide\ntiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad white forehead, beneath the\ntransparent skin, looked knitted together; as head on, he came churning his tail\namong the boats; and once more flailed them apart; spilling out the irons and\nlances from the two mates’ boats, and dashing in one side of the upper part of\ntheir bows, but leaving Ahab’s almost without a scar.\n\nWhile Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks; and as the whale\nswimming out from them, turned, and showed one entire flank as he shot by them\nagain; at that moment a quick cry went up. Lashed round and round to the fish’s\nback; pinioned in the turns upon turns in which, during the past night, the\nwhale had reeled the involutions of the lines around him, the half torn body of\nthe Parsee was seen; his sable raiment frayed to shreds; his distended eyes\nturned full upon old Ahab.\n\nThe harpoon dropped from his hand.\n\n“Befooled, befooled!”—drawing in a long lean breath—“Aye, Parsee! I see thee\nagain.—Aye, and thou goest before; and this, this then is the hearse that thou\ndidst promise. But I hold thee to the last letter of thy word. Where is the\nsecond hearse? Away, mates, to the ship! those boats are useless now; repair\nthem if ye can in time, and return to me; if not, Ahab is enough to die—Down,\nmen! the first thing that but offers to jump from this boat I stand in, that\nthing I harpoon. Ye are not other men, but my arms and my legs; and so obey\nme.—Where’s the whale? gone down again?”\n\nBut he looked too nigh the boat; for as if bent upon escaping with the corpse he\nbore, and as if the particular place of the last encounter had been but a stage\nin his leeward voyage, Moby Dick was now again steadily swimming forward; and\nhad almost passed the ship,—which thus far had been sailing in the contrary\ndirection to him, though for the present her headway had been stopped. He seemed\nswimming with his utmost velocity, and now only intent upon pursuing his own\nstraight path in the sea.\n\n“Oh! Ahab,” cried Starbuck, “not too late is it, even now, the third day, to\ndesist. See! Moby Dick seeks thee not. It is thou, thou, that madly seekest\nhim!”\n\nSetting sail to the rising wind, the lonely boat was swiftly impelled to\nleeward, by both oars and canvas. And at last when Ahab was sliding by the\nvessel, so near as plainly to distinguish Starbuck’s face as he leaned over the\nrail, he hailed him to turn the vessel about, and follow him, not too swiftly,\nat a judicious interval. Glancing upwards, he saw Tashtego, Queequeg, and\nDaggoo, eagerly mounting to the three mast-heads; while the oarsmen were rocking\nin the two staved boats which had but just been hoisted to the side, and were\nbusily at work in repairing them. One after the other, through the port-holes,\nas he sped, he also caught flying glimpses of Stubb and Flask, busying\nthemselves on deck among bundles of new irons and lances. As he saw all this; as\nhe heard the hammers in the broken boats; far other hammers seemed driving a\nnail into his heart. But he rallied. And now marking that the vane or flag was\ngone from the main-mast-head, he shouted to Tashtego, who had just gained that\nperch, to descend again for another flag, and a hammer and nails, and so nail it\nto the mast.\n\nWhether fagged by the three days’ running chase, and the resistance to his\nswimming in the knotted hamper he bore; or whether it was some latent\ndeceitfulness and malice in him: whichever was true, the White Whale’s way now\nbegan to abate, as it seemed, from the boat so rapidly nearing him once more;\nthough indeed the whale’s last start had not been so long a one as before. And\nstill as Ahab glided over the waves the unpitying sharks accompanied him; and so\npertinaciously stuck to the boat; and so continually bit at the plying oars,\nthat the blades became jagged and crunched, and left small splinters in the sea,\nat almost every dip.\n\n“Heed them not! those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars. Pull on! ’tis\nthe better rest, the shark’s jaw than the yielding water.”\n\n“But at every bite, sir, the thin blades grow smaller and smaller!”\n\n“They will last long enough! pull on!—But who can tell”—he muttered—“whether\nthese sharks swim to feast on the whale or on Ahab?—But pull on! Aye, all alive,\nnow—we near him. The helm! take the helm! let me pass,”—and so saying two of the\noarsmen helped him forward to the bows of the still flying boat.\n\nAt length as the craft was cast to one side, and ran ranging along with the\nWhite Whale’s flank, he seemed strangely oblivious of its advance—as the whale\nsometimes will—and Ahab was fairly within the smoky mountain mist, which, thrown\noff from the whale’s spout, curled round his great, Monadnock hump; he was even\nthus close to him; when, with body arched back, and both arms lengthwise\nhigh-lifted to the poise, he darted his fierce iron, and his far fiercer curse\ninto the hated whale. As both steel and curse sank to the socket, as if sucked\ninto a morass, Moby Dick sideways writhed; spasmodically rolled his nigh flank\nagainst the bow, and, without staving a hole in it, so suddenly canted the boat\nover, that had it not been for the elevated part of the gunwale to which he then\nclung, Ahab would once more have been tossed into the sea. As it was, three of\nthe oarsmen—who foreknew not the precise instant of the dart, and were therefore\nunprepared for its effects—these were flung out; but so fell, that, in an\ninstant two of them clutched the gunwale again, and rising to its level on a\ncombing wave, hurled themselves bodily inboard again; the third man helplessly\ndropping astern, but still afloat and swimming.\n\nAlmost simultaneously, with a mighty volition of ungraduated, instantaneous\nswiftness, the White Whale darted through the weltering sea. But when Ahab cried\nout to the steersman to take new turns with the line, and hold it so; and\ncommanded the crew to turn round on their seats, and tow the boat up to the\nmark; the moment the treacherous line felt that double strain and tug, it\nsnapped in the empty air!\n\n“What breaks in me? Some sinew cracks!—’tis whole again; oars! oars! Burst in\nupon him!”\n\nHearing the tremendous rush of the sea-crashing boat, the whale wheeled round to\npresent his blank forehead at bay; but in that evolution, catching sight of the\nnearing black hull of the ship; seemingly seeing in it the source of all his\npersecutions; bethinking it—it may be—a larger and nobler foe; of a sudden, he\nbore down upon its advancing prow, smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam.\n\nAhab staggered; his hand smote his forehead. “I grow blind; hands! stretch out\nbefore me that I may yet grope my way. Is’t night?”\n\n“The whale! The ship!” cried the cringing oarsmen.\n\n“Oars! oars! Slope downwards to thy depths, O sea, that ere it be for ever too\nlate, Ahab may slide this last, last time upon his mark! I see: the ship! the\nship! Dash on, my men! Will ye not save my ship?”\n\nBut as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the sledge-hammering\nseas, the before whale-smitten bow-ends of two planks burst through, and in an\ninstant almost, the temporarily disabled boat lay nearly level with the waves;\nits half-wading, splashing crew, trying hard to stop the gap and bale out the\npouring water.\n\nMeantime, for that one beholding instant, Tashtego’s mast-head hammer remained\nsuspended in his hand; and the red flag, half-wrapping him as with a plaid, then\nstreamed itself straight out from him, as his own forward-flowing heart; while\nStarbuck and Stubb, standing upon the bowsprit beneath, caught sight of the\ndown-coming monster just as soon as he.\n\n“The whale, the whale! Up helm, up helm! Oh, all ye sweet powers of air, now hug\nme close! Let not Starbuck die, if die he must, in a woman’s fainting fit. Up\nhelm, I say—ye fools, the jaw! the jaw! Is this the end of all my bursting\nprayers? all my life-long fidelities? Oh, Ahab, Ahab, lo, thy work. Steady!\nhelmsman, steady. Nay, nay! Up helm again! He turns to meet us! Oh, his\nunappeasable brow drives on towards one, whose duty tells him he cannot depart.\nMy God, stand by me now!”\n\n“Stand not by me, but stand under me, whoever you are that will now help Stubb;\nfor Stubb, too, sticks here. I grin at thee, thou grinning whale! Who ever\nhelped Stubb, or kept Stubb awake, but Stubb’s own unwinking eye? And now poor\nStubb goes to bed upon a mattrass that is all too soft; would it were stuffed\nwith brushwood! I grin at thee, thou grinning whale! Look ye, sun, moon, and\nstars! I call ye assassins of as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost. For\nall that, I would yet ring glasses with ye, would ye but hand the cup! Oh, oh!\noh, oh! thou grinning whale, but there’ll be plenty of gulping soon! Why fly ye\nnot, O Ahab! For me, off shoes and jacket to it; let Stubb die in his drawers! A\nmost mouldy and over salted death, though;—cherries! cherries! cherries! Oh,\nFlask, for one red cherry ere we die!”\n\n“Cherries? I only wish that we were where they grow. Oh, Stubb, I hope my poor\nmother’s drawn my part-pay ere this; if not, few coppers will now come to her,\nfor the voyage is up.”\n\nFrom the ship’s bows, nearly all the seamen now hung inactive; hammers, bits of\nplank, lances, and harpoons, mechanically retained in their hands, just as they\nhad darted from their various employments; all their enchanted eyes intent upon\nthe whale, which from side to side strangely vibrating his predestinating head,\nsent a broad band of overspreading semicircular foam before him as he rushed.\nRetribution, swift vengeance, eternal malice were in his whole aspect, and spite\nof all that mortal man could do, the solid white buttress of his forehead smote\nthe ship’s starboard bow, till men and timbers reeled. Some fell flat upon their\nfaces. Like dislodged trucks, the heads of the harpooneers aloft shook on their\nbull-like necks. Through the breach, they heard the waters pour, as mountain\ntorrents down a flume.\n\n“The ship! The hearse!—the second hearse!” cried Ahab from the boat; “its wood\ncould only be American!”\n\nDiving beneath the settling ship, the whale ran quivering along its keel; but\nturning under water, swiftly shot to the surface again, far off the other bow,\nbut within a few yards of Ahab’s boat, where, for a time, he lay quiescent.\n\n“I turn my body from the sun. What ho, Tashtego! let me hear thy hammer. Oh! ye\nthree unsurrendered spires of mine; thou uncracked keel; and only god-bullied\nhull; thou firm deck, and haughty helm, and Pole-pointed prow,—death-glorious\nship! must ye then perish, and without me? Am I cut off from the last fond pride\nof meanest shipwrecked captains? Oh, lonely death on lonely life! Oh, now I feel\nmy topmost greatness lies in my topmost grief. Ho, ho! from all your furthest\nbounds, pour ye now in, ye bold billows of my whole foregone life, and top this\none piled comber of my death! Towards thee I roll, thou all-destroying but\nunconquering whale; to the last I grapple with thee; from hell’s heart I stab at\nthee; for hate’s sake I spit my last breath at thee. Sink all coffins and all\nhearses to one common pool! and since neither can be mine, let me then tow to\npieces, while still chasing thee, though tied to thee, thou damned whale! Thus,\nI give up the spear!”\n\nThe harpoon was darted; the stricken whale flew forward; with igniting velocity\nthe line ran through the grooves;—ran foul. Ahab stooped to clear it; he did\nclear it; but the flying turn caught him round the neck, and voicelessly as\nTurkish mutes bowstring their victim, he was shot out of the boat, ere the crew\nknew he was gone. Next instant, the heavy eye-splice in the rope’s final end\nflew out of the stark-empty tub, knocked down an oarsman, and smiting the sea,\ndisappeared in its depths.\n\nFor an instant, the tranced boat’s crew stood still; then turned. “The ship?\nGreat God, where is the ship?” Soon they through dim, bewildering mediums saw\nher sidelong fading phantom, as in the gaseous Fata Morgana; only the uppermost\nmasts out of water; while fixed by infatuation, or fidelity, or fate, to their\nonce lofty perches, the pagan harpooneers still maintained their sinking\nlookouts on the sea. And now, concentric circles seized the lone boat itself,\nand all its crew, and each floating oar, and every lance-pole, and spinning,\nanimate and inanimate, all round and round in one vortex, carried the smallest\nchip of the Pequod out of sight.\n\nBut as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the sunken head\nof the Indian at the mainmast, leaving a few inches of the erect spar yet\nvisible, together with long streaming yards of the flag, which calmly undulated,\nwith ironical coincidings, over the destroying billows they almost touched;—at\nthat instant, a red arm and a hammer hovered backwardly uplifted in the open\nair, in the act of nailing the flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar.\nA sky-hawk that tauntingly had followed the main-truck downwards from its\nnatural home among the stars, pecking at the flag, and incommoding Tashtego\nthere; this bird now chanced to intercept its broad fluttering wing between the\nhammer and the wood; and simultaneously feeling that etherial thrill, the\nsubmerged savage beneath, in his death-gasp, kept his hammer frozen there; and\nso the bird of heaven, with archangelic shrieks, and his imperial beak thrust\nupwards, and his whole captive form folded in the flag of Ahab, went down with\nhis ship, which, like Satan, would not sink to hell till she had dragged a\nliving part of heaven along with her, and helmeted herself with it.\n\nNow small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf; a sullen white surf\nbeat against its steep sides; then all collapsed, and the great shroud of the\nsea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEPILOGUE\n\n\n“AND I ONLY AM ESCAPED ALONE TO TELL THEE” JOB.\n\nThe drama’s done. Why then here does any one step forth?—Because one did survive\nthe wreck.\n\nIt so chanced, that after the Parsee’s disappearance, I was he whom the Fates\nordained to take the place of Ahab’s bowsman, when that bowsman assumed the\nvacant post; the same, who, when on the last day the three men were tossed from\nout of the rocking boat, was dropped astern. So, floating on the margin of the\nensuing scene, and in full sight of it, when the halfspent suction of the sunk\nship reached me, I was then, but slowly, drawn towards the closing vortex. When\nI reached it, it had subsided to a creamy pool. Round and round, then, and ever\ncontracting towards the button-like black bubble at the axis of that slowly\nwheeling circle, like another Ixion I did revolve. Till, gaining that vital\ncentre, the black bubble upward burst; and now, liberated by reason of its\ncunning spring, and, owing to its great buoyancy, rising with great force, the\ncoffin life-buoy shot lengthwise from the sea, fell over, and floated by my\nside. Buoyed up by that coffin, for almost one whole day and night, I floated on\na soft and dirgelike main. The unharming sharks, they glided by as if with\npadlocks on their mouths; the savage sea-hawks sailed with sheathed beaks. On\nthe second day, a sail drew near, nearer, and picked me up at last. It was the\ndevious-cruising Rachel, that in her retracing search after her missing\nchildren, only found another orphan.\n\n"},{"title":"Test Section Title","content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 37. SUNSET.\n\nThe cabin; by the stern windows; Ahab sitting alone, and gazing out.\n\nI leave a white and turbid wake; pale waters, paler cheeks, where’er I sail. The\nenvious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track; let them; but first I pass.\n\nYonder, by ever-brimming goblet’s rim, the warm waves blush like wine. The gold\nbrow plumbs the blue. The diver sun—slow dived from noon—goes down; my soul\nmounts up! she wearies with her endless hill. Is, then, the crown too heavy that\nI wear? this Iron Crown of Lombardy. Yet is it bright with many a gem; I the\nwearer, see not its far flashings; but darkly feel that I wear that, that\ndazzlingly confounds. ’Tis iron—that I know—not gold. ’Tis split, too—that I\nfeel; the jagged edge galls me so, my brain seems to beat against the solid\nmetal; aye, steel skull, mine; the sort that needs no helmet in the most\nbrain-battering fight!\n\nDry heat upon my brow? Oh! time was, when as the sunrise nobly spurred me, so\nthe sunset soothed. No more. This lovely light, it lights not me; all loveliness\nis anguish to me, since I can ne’er enjoy. Gifted with the high perception, I\nlack the low, enjoying power; damned, most subtly and most malignantly! damned\nin the midst of Paradise! Good night—good night! (waving his hand, he moves from\nthe window.)\n\n’Twas not so hard a task. I thought to find one stubborn, at the least; but my\none cogged circle fits into all their various wheels, and they revolve. Or, if\nyou will, like so many ant-hills of powder, they all stand before me; and I\ntheir match. Oh, hard! that to fire others, the match itself must needs be\nwasting! What I’ve dared, I’ve willed; and what I’ve willed, I’ll do! They think\nme mad—Starbuck does; but I’m demoniac, I am madness maddened! That wild madness\nthat’s only calm to comprehend itself! The prophecy was that I should be\ndismembered; and—Aye! I lost this leg. I now prophesy that I will dismember my\ndismemberer. Now, then, be the prophet and the fulfiller one. That’s more than\nye, ye great gods, ever were. I laugh and hoot at ye, ye cricket-players, ye\npugilists, ye deaf Burkes and blinded Bendigoes! I will not say as schoolboys do\nto bullies—Take some one of your own size; don’t pommel me! No, ye’ve knocked me\ndown, and I am up again; but ye have run and hidden. Come forth from behind your\ncotton bags! I have no long gun to reach ye. Come, Ahab’s compliments to ye;\ncome and see if ye can swerve me. Swerve me? ye cannot swerve me, else ye swerve\nyourselves! man has ye there. Swerve me? The path to my fixed purpose is laid\nwith iron rails, whereon my soul is grooved to run. Over unsounded gorges,\nthrough the rifled hearts of mountains, under torrents’ beds, unerringly I rush!\nNaught’s an obstacle, naught’s an angle to the iron way!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 38. DUSK.\n\nBy the Mainmast; Starbuck leaning against it.\n\nMy soul is more than matched; she’s overmanned; and by a madman! Insufferable\nsting, that sanity should ground arms on such a field! But he drilled deep down,\nand blasted all my reason out of me! I think I see his impious end; but feel\nthat I must help him to it. Will I, nill I, the ineffable thing has tied me to\nhim; tows me with a cable I have no knife to cut. Horrible old man! Who’s over\nhim, he cries;—aye, he would be a democrat to all above; look, how he lords it\nover all below! Oh! I plainly see my miserable office,—to obey, rebelling; and\nworse yet, to hate with touch of pity! For in his eyes I read some lurid woe\nwould shrivel me up, had I it. Yet is there hope. Time and tide flow wide. The\nhated whale has the round watery world to swim in, as the small gold-fish has\nits glassy globe. His heaven-insulting purpose, God may wedge aside. I would up\nheart, were it not like lead. But my whole clock’s run down; my heart the\nall-controlling weight, I have no key to lift again.\n\n[A burst of revelry from the forecastle.]\n\nOh, God! to sail with such a heathen crew that have small touch of human mothers\nin them! Whelped somewhere by the sharkish sea. The white whale is their\ndemigorgon. Hark! the infernal orgies! that revelry is forward! mark the\nunfaltering silence aft! Methinks it pictures life. Foremost through the\nsparkling sea shoots on the gay, embattled, bantering bow, but only to drag dark\nAhab after it, where he broods within his sternward cabin, builded over the dead\nwater of the wake, and further on, hunted by its wolfish gurglings. The long\nhowl thrills me through! Peace! ye revellers, and set the watch! Oh, life! ’tis\nin an hour like this, with soul beat down and held to knowledge,—as wild,\nuntutored things are forced to feed—Oh, life! ’tis now that I do feel the latent\nhorror in thee! but ’tis not me! that horror’s out of me! and with the soft\nfeeling of the human in me, yet will I try to fight ye, ye grim, phantom\nfutures! Stand by me, hold me, bind me, O ye blessed influences!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 39. FIRST NIGHT-WATCH.\n\nFore-Top.\n\n(Stubb solus, and mending a brace.)\n\nHa! ha! ha! ha! hem! clear my throat!—I’ve been thinking over it ever since, and\nthat ha, ha’s the final consequence. Why so? Because a laugh’s the wisest,\neasiest answer to all that’s queer; and come what will, one comfort’s always\nleft—that unfailing comfort is, it’s all predestinated. I heard not all his talk\nwith Starbuck; but to my poor eye Starbuck then looked something as I the other\nevening felt. Be sure the old Mogul has fixed him, too. I twigged it, knew it;\nhad had the gift, might readily have prophesied it—for when I clapped my eye\nupon his skull I saw it. Well, Stubb, wise Stubb—that’s my title—well, Stubb,\nwhat of it, Stubb? Here’s a carcase. I know not all that may be coming, but be\nit what it will, I’ll go to it laughing. Such a waggish leering as lurks in all\nyour horribles! I feel funny. Fa, la! lirra, skirra! What’s my juicy little pear\nat home doing now? Crying its eyes out?—Giving a party to the last arrived\nharpooneers, I dare say, gay as a frigate’s pennant, and so am I—fa, la! lirra,\nskirra! Oh—\n\n      We’ll drink to-night with hearts as light,\n         To love, as gay and fleeting\n      As bubbles that swim, on the beaker’s brim,\n         And break on the lips while meeting.\n\n\nA brave stave that—who calls? Mr. Starbuck? Aye, aye, sir—(Aside) he’s my\nsuperior, he has his too, if I’m not mistaken.—Aye, aye, sir, just through with\nthis job—coming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 40. MIDNIGHT, FORECASTLE.\n\nHARPOONEERS AND SAILORS.\n\n(Foresail rises and discovers the watch standing, lounging, leaning, and lying\nin various attitudes, all singing in chorus.)\n\n     Farewell and adieu to you, Spanish ladies!\n     Farewell and adieu to you, ladies of Spain!\n     Our captain’s commanded.—\n\n\n1ST NANTUCKET SAILOR. Oh, boys, don’t be sentimental; it’s bad for the\ndigestion! Take a tonic, follow me!\n\n(Sings, and all follow.)\n\n    Our captain stood upon the deck,\n    A spy-glass in his hand,\n    A viewing of those gallant whales\n    That blew at every strand.\n    Oh, your tubs in your boats, my boys,\n    And by your braces stand,\n    And we’ll have one of those fine whales,\n    Hand, boys, over hand!\n    So, be cheery, my lads! may your hearts never fail!\n    While the bold harpooner is striking the whale!\n\n\nMATE’S VOICE FROM THE QUARTER-DECK. Eight bells there, forward!\n\n2ND NANTUCKET SAILOR. Avast the chorus! Eight bells there! d’ye hear, bell-boy?\nStrike the bell eight, thou Pip! thou blackling! and let me call the watch. I’ve\nthe sort of mouth for that—the hogshead mouth. So, so, (thrusts his head down\nthe scuttle,) Star-bo-l-e-e-n-s, a-h-o-y! Eight bells there below! Tumble up!\n\nDUTCH SAILOR. Grand snoozing to-night, maty; fat night for that. I mark this in\nour old Mogul’s wine; it’s quite as deadening to some as filliping to others. We\nsing; they sleep—aye, lie down there, like ground-tier butts. At ’em again!\nThere, take this copper-pump, and hail ’em through it. Tell ’em to avast\ndreaming of their lasses. Tell ’em it’s the resurrection; they must kiss their\nlast, and come to judgment. That’s the way—that’s it; thy throat ain’t spoiled\nwith eating Amsterdam butter.\n\nFRENCH SAILOR. Hist, boys! let’s have a jig or two before we ride to anchor in\nBlanket Bay. What say ye? There comes the other watch. Stand by all legs! Pip!\nlittle Pip! hurrah with your tambourine!\n\nPIP. (Sulky and sleepy.) Don’t know where it is.\n\nFRENCH SAILOR. Beat thy belly, then, and wag thy ears. Jig it, men, I say;\nmerry’s the word; hurrah! Damn me, won’t you dance? Form, now, Indian-file, and\ngallop into the double-shuffle? Throw yourselves! Legs! legs!\n\nICELAND SAILOR. I don’t like your floor, maty; it’s too springy to my taste. I’m\nused to ice-floors. I’m sorry to throw cold water on the subject; but excuse me.\n\nMALTESE SAILOR. Me too; where’s your girls? Who but a fool would take his left\nhand by his right, and say to himself, how d’ye do? Partners! I must have\npartners!\n\nSICILIAN SAILOR. Aye; girls and a green!—then I’ll hop with ye; yea, turn\ngrasshopper!\n\nLONG-ISLAND SAILOR. Well, well, ye sulkies, there’s plenty more of us. Hoe corn\nwhen you may, say I. All legs go to harvest soon. Ah! here comes the music; now\nfor it!\n\nAZORE SAILOR. (Ascending, and pitching the tambourine up the scuttle.) Here you\nare, Pip; and there’s the windlass-bitts; up you mount! Now, boys! (The half of\nthem dance to the tambourine; some go below; some sleep or lie among the coils\nof rigging. Oaths a-plenty.)\n\nAZORE SAILOR. (Dancing) Go it, Pip! Bang it, bell-boy! Rig it, dig it, stig it,\nquig it, bell-boy! Make fire-flies; break the jinglers!\n\nPIP. Jinglers, you say?—there goes another, dropped off; I pound it so.\n\nCHINA SAILOR. Rattle thy teeth, then, and pound away; make a pagoda of thyself.\n\nFRENCH SAILOR. Merry-mad! Hold up thy hoop, Pip, till I jump through it! Split\njibs! tear yourselves!\n\nTASHTEGO. (Quietly smoking.) That’s a white man; he calls that fun: humph! I\nsave my sweat.\n\nOLD MANX SAILOR. I wonder whether those jolly lads bethink them of what they are\ndancing over. I’ll dance over your grave, I will—that’s the bitterest threat of\nyour night-women, that beat head-winds round corners. O Christ! to think of the\ngreen navies and the green-skulled crews! Well, well; belike the whole world’s a\nball, as you scholars have it; and so ’tis right to make one ballroom of it.\nDance on, lads, you’re young; I was once.\n\n3D NANTUCKET SAILOR. Spell oh!—whew! this is worse than pulling after whales in\na calm—give us a whiff, Tash.\n\n(They cease dancing, and gather in clusters. Meantime the sky darkens—the wind\nrises.)\n\nLASCAR SAILOR. By Brahma! boys, it’ll be douse sail soon. The sky-born,\nhigh-tide Ganges turned to wind! Thou showest thy black brow, Seeva!\n\nMALTESE SAILOR. (Reclining and shaking his cap.) It’s the waves—the snow’s caps\nturn to jig it now. They’ll shake their tassels soon. Now would all the waves\nwere women, then I’d go drown, and chassee with them evermore! There’s naught so\nsweet on earth—heaven may not match it!—as those swift glances of warm, wild\nbosoms in the dance, when the over-arboring arms hide such ripe, bursting\ngrapes.\n\nSICILIAN SAILOR. (Reclining.) Tell me not of it! Hark ye, lad—fleet interlacings\nof the limbs—lithe swayings—coyings—flutterings! lip! heart! hip! all graze:\nunceasing touch and go! not taste, observe ye, else come satiety. Eh, Pagan?\n(Nudging.)\n\nTAHITAN SAILOR. (Reclining on a mat.) Hail, holy nakedness of our dancing\ngirls!—the Heeva-Heeva! Ah! low veiled, high palmed Tahiti! I still rest me on\nthy mat, but the soft soil has slid! I saw thee woven in the wood, my mat! green\nthe first day I brought ye thence; now worn and wilted quite. Ah me!—not thou\nnor I can bear the change! How then, if so be transplanted to yon sky? Hear I\nthe roaring streams from Pirohitee’s peak of spears, when they leap down the\ncrags and drown the villages?—The blast! the blast! Up, spine, and meet it!\n(Leaps to his feet.)\n\nPORTUGUESE SAILOR. How the sea rolls swashing ’gainst the side! Stand by for\nreefing, hearties! the winds are just crossing swords, pell-mell they’ll go\nlunging presently.\n\nDANISH SAILOR. Crack, crack, old ship! so long as thou crackest, thou holdest!\nWell done! The mate there holds ye to it stiffly. He’s no more afraid than the\nisle fort at Cattegat, put there to fight the Baltic with storm-lashed guns, on\nwhich the sea-salt cakes!\n\n4TH NANTUCKET SAILOR. He has his orders, mind ye that. I heard old Ahab tell him\nhe must always kill a squall, something as they burst a waterspout with a\npistol—fire your ship right into it!\n\nENGLISH SAILOR. Blood! but that old man’s a grand old cove! We are the lads to\nhunt him up his whale!\n\nALL. Aye! aye!\n\nOLD MANX SAILOR. How the three pines shake! Pines are the hardest sort of tree\nto live when shifted to any other soil, and here there’s none but the crew’s\ncursed clay. Steady, helmsman! steady. This is the sort of weather when brave\nhearts snap ashore, and keeled hulls split at sea. Our captain has his\nbirthmark; look yonder, boys, there’s another in the sky—lurid-like, ye see, all\nelse pitch black.\n\nDAGGOO. What of that? Who’s afraid of black’s afraid of me! I’m quarried out of\nit!\n\nSPANISH SAILOR. (Aside.) He wants to bully, ah!—the old grudge makes me touchy\n(Advancing.) Aye, harpooneer, thy race is the undeniable dark side of\nmankind—devilish dark at that. No offence.\n\nDAGGOO (grimly). None.\n\nST. JAGO’S SAILOR. That Spaniard’s mad or drunk. But that can’t be, or else in\nhis one case our old Mogul’s fire-waters are somewhat long in working.\n\n5TH NANTUCKET SAILOR. What’s that I saw—lightning? Yes.\n\nSPANISH SAILOR. No; Daggoo showing his teeth.\n\nDAGGOO (springing). Swallow thine, mannikin! White skin, white liver!\n\nSPANISH SAILOR (meeting him). Knife thee heartily! big frame, small spirit!\n\nALL. A row! a row! a row!\n\nTASHTEGO (with a whiff). A row a’low, and a row aloft—Gods and men—both\nbrawlers! Humph!\n\nBELFAST SAILOR. A row! arrah a row! The Virgin be blessed, a row! Plunge in with\nye!\n\nENGLISH SAILOR. Fair play! Snatch the Spaniard’s knife! A ring, a ring!\n\nOLD MANX SAILOR. Ready formed. There! the ringed horizon. In that ring Cain\nstruck Abel. Sweet work, right work! No? Why then, God, mad’st thou the ring?\n\nMATE’S VOICE FROM THE QUARTER-DECK. Hands by the halyards! in top-gallant sails!\nStand by to reef topsails!\n\nALL. The squall! the squall! jump, my jollies! (They scatter.)\n\nPIP (shrinking under the windlass). Jollies? Lord help such jollies! Crish,\ncrash! there goes the jib-stay! Blang-whang! God! Duck lower, Pip, here comes\nthe royal yard! It’s worse than being in the whirled woods, the last day of the\nyear! Who’d go climbing after chestnuts now? But there they go, all cursing, and\nhere I don’t. Fine prospects to ’em; they’re on the road to heaven. Hold on\nhard! Jimmini, what a squall! But those chaps there are worse yet—they are your\nwhite squalls, they. White squalls? white whale, shirr! shirr! Here have I heard\nall their chat just now, and the white whale—shirr! shirr!—but spoken of once!\nand only this evening—it makes me jingle all over like my tambourine—that\nanaconda of an old man swore ’em in to hunt him! Oh, thou big white God aloft\nthere somewhere in yon darkness, have mercy on this small black boy down here;\npreserve him from all men that have no bowels to feel fear!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 41. MOBY DICK.\n\nI, Ishmael, was one of that crew; my shouts had gone up with the rest; my oath\nhad been welded with theirs; and stronger I shouted, and more did I hammer and\nclinch my oath, because of the dread in my soul. A wild, mystical, sympathetical\nfeeling was in me; Ahab’s quenchless feud seemed mine. With greedy ears I\nlearned the history of that murderous monster against whom I and all the others\nhad taken our oaths of violence and revenge.\n\nFor some time past, though at intervals only, the unaccompanied, secluded White\nWhale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly frequented by the Sperm Whale\nfishermen. But not all of them knew of his existence; only a few of them,\ncomparatively, had knowingly seen him; while the number who as yet had actually\nand knowingly given battle to him, was small indeed. For, owing to the large\nnumber of whale-cruisers; the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire\nwatery circumference, many of them adventurously pushing their quest along\nsolitary latitudes, so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth or more on a\nstretch, to encounter a single news-telling sail of any sort; the inordinate\nlength of each separate voyage; the irregularity of the times of sailing from\nhome; all these, with other circumstances, direct and indirect, long obstructed\nthe spread through the whole world-wide whaling-fleet of the special\nindividualizing tidings concerning Moby Dick. It was hardly to be doubted, that\nseveral vessels reported to have encountered, at such or such a time, or on such\nor such a meridian, a Sperm Whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity, which\nwhale, after doing great mischief to his assailants, had completely escaped\nthem; to some minds it was not an unfair presumption, I say, that the whale in\nquestion must have been no other than Moby Dick. Yet as of late the Sperm Whale\nfishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent instances of great\nferocity, cunning, and malice in the monster attacked; therefore it was, that\nthose who by accident ignorantly gave battle to Moby Dick; such hunters,\nperhaps, for the most part, were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred,\nmore, as it were, to the perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large, than to the\nindividual cause. In that way, mostly, the disastrous encounter between Ahab and\nthe whale had hitherto been popularly regarded.\n\nAnd as for those who, previously hearing of the White Whale, by chance caught\nsight of him; in the beginning of the thing they had every one of them, almost,\nas boldly and fearlessly lowered for him, as for any other whale of that\nspecies. But at length, such calamities did ensue in these assaults—not\nrestricted to sprained wrists and ankles, broken limbs, or devouring\namputations—but fatal to the last degree of fatality; those repeated disastrous\nrepulses, all accumulating and piling their terrors upon Moby Dick; those things\nhad gone far to shake the fortitude of many brave hunters, to whom the story of\nthe White Whale had eventually come.\n\nNor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still the more horrify\nthe true histories of these deadly encounters. For not only do fabulous rumors\nnaturally grow out of the very body of all surprising terrible events,—as the\nsmitten tree gives birth to its fungi; but, in maritime life, far more than in\nthat of terra firma, wild rumors abound, wherever there is any adequate reality\nfor them to cling to. And as the sea surpasses the land in this matter, so the\nwhale fishery surpasses every other sort of maritime life, in the wonderfulness\nand fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there. For not only are\nwhalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary\nto all sailors; but of all sailors, they are by all odds the most directly\nbrought into contact with whatever is appallingly astonishing in the sea; face\nto face they not only eye its greatest marvels, but, hand to jaw, give battle to\nthem. Alone, in such remotest waters, that though you sailed a thousand miles,\nand passed a thousand shores, you would not come to any chiseled hearth-stone,\nor aught hospitable beneath that part of the sun; in such latitudes and\nlongitudes, pursuing too such a calling as he does, the whaleman is wrapped by\ninfluences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth.\n\nNo wonder, then, that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over the\nwidest watery spaces, the outblown rumors of the White Whale did in the end\nincorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints, and half-formed fœtal\nsuggestions of supernatural agencies, which eventually invested Moby Dick with\nnew terrors unborrowed from anything that visibly appears. So that in many cases\nsuch a panic did he finally strike, that few who by those rumors, at least, had\nheard of the White Whale, few of those hunters were willing to encounter the\nperils of his jaw.\n\nBut there were still other and more vital practical influences at work. Not even\nat the present day has the original prestige of the Sperm Whale, as fearfully\ndistinguished from all other species of the leviathan, died out of the minds of\nthe whalemen as a body. There are those this day among them, who, though\nintelligent and courageous enough in offering battle to the Greenland or Right\nwhale, would perhaps—either from professional inexperience, or incompetency, or\ntimidity, decline a contest with the Sperm Whale; at any rate, there are plenty\nof whalemen, especially among those whaling nations not sailing under the\nAmerican flag, who have never hostilely encountered the Sperm Whale, but whose\nsole knowledge of the leviathan is restricted to the ignoble monster primitively\npursued in the North; seated on their hatches, these men will hearken with a\nchildish fireside interest and awe, to the wild, strange tales of Southern\nwhaling. Nor is the pre-eminent tremendousness of the great Sperm Whale anywhere\nmore feelingly comprehended, than on board of those prows which stem him.\n\nAnd as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary times\nthrown its shadow before it; we find some book naturalists—Olassen and\nPovelson—declaring the Sperm Whale not only to be a consternation to every other\ncreature in the sea, but also to be so incredibly ferocious as continually to be\nathirst for human blood. Nor even down to so late a time as Cuvier’s, were these\nor almost similar impressions effaced. For in his Natural History, the Baron\nhimself affirms that at sight of the Sperm Whale, all fish (sharks included) are\n“struck with the most lively terrors,” and “often in the precipitancy of their\nflight dash themselves against the rocks with such violence as to cause\ninstantaneous death.” And however the general experiences in the fishery may\namend such reports as these; yet in their full terribleness, even to the\nbloodthirsty item of Povelson, the superstitious belief in them is, in some\nvicissitudes of their vocation, revived in the minds of the hunters.\n\nSo that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him, not a few of the\nfishermen recalled, in reference to Moby Dick, the earlier days of the Sperm\nWhale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to induce long practised Right\nwhalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring warfare; such men\nprotesting that although other leviathans might be hopefully pursued, yet to\nchase and point lance at such an apparition as the Sperm Whale was not for\nmortal man. That to attempt it, would be inevitably to be torn into a quick\neternity. On this head, there are some remarkable documents that may be\nconsulted.\n\nNevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things were ready\nto give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater number who, chancing only to\nhear of him distantly and vaguely, without the specific details of any certain\ncalamity, and without superstitious accompaniments, were sufficiently hardy not\nto flee from the battle if offered.\n\nOne of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be linked with the\nWhite Whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined, was the unearthly\nconceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous; that he had actually been encountered in\nopposite latitudes at one and the same instant of time.\n\nNor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit altogether without\nsome faint show of superstitious probability. For as the secrets of the currents\nin the seas have never yet been divulged, even to the most erudite research; so\nthe hidden ways of the Sperm Whale when beneath the surface remain, in great\npart, unaccountable to his pursuers; and from time to time have originated the\nmost curious and contradictory speculations regarding them, especially\nconcerning the mystic modes whereby, after sounding to a great depth, he\ntransports himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant points.\n\nIt is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships, and as well a\nthing placed upon authoritative record years ago by Scoresby, that some whales\nhave been captured far north in the Pacific, in whose bodies have been found the\nbarbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland seas. Nor is it to be gainsaid, that\nin some of these instances it has been declared that the interval of time\nbetween the two assaults could not have exceeded very many days. Hence, by\ninference, it has been believed by some whalemen, that the Nor’ West Passage, so\nlong a problem to man, was never a problem to the whale. So that here, in the\nreal living experience of living men, the prodigies related in old times of the\ninland Strello mountain in Portugal (near whose top there was said to be a lake\nin which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface); and that still more\nwonderful story of the Arethusa fountain near Syracuse (whose waters were\nbelieved to have come from the Holy Land by an underground passage); these\nfabulous narrations are almost fully equalled by the realities of the whalemen.\n\nForced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and knowing that\nafter repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had escaped alive; it cannot\nbe much matter of surprise that some whalemen should go still further in their\nsuperstitions; declaring Moby Dick not only ubiquitous, but immortal (for\nimmortality is but ubiquity in time); that though groves of spears should be\nplanted in his flanks, he would still swim away unharmed; or if indeed he should\never be made to spout thick blood, such a sight would be but a ghastly\ndeception; for again in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away, his\nunsullied jet would once more be seen.\n\nBut even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough in the\nearthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike the\nimagination with unwonted power. For, it was not so much his uncommon bulk that\nso much distinguished him from other sperm whales, but, as was elsewhere thrown\nout—a peculiar snow-white wrinkled forehead, and a high, pyramidical white hump.\nThese were his prominent features; the tokens whereby, even in the limitless,\nuncharted seas, he revealed his identity, at a long distance, to those who knew\nhim.\n\nThe rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with the same\nshrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his distinctive appellation of the\nWhite Whale; a name, indeed, literally justified by his vivid aspect, when seen\ngliding at high noon through a dark blue sea, leaving a milky-way wake of creamy\nfoam, all spangled with golden gleamings.\n\nNor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet his deformed\nlower jaw, that so much invested the whale with natural terror, as that\nunexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to specific accounts, he had\nover and over again evinced in his assaults. More than all, his treacherous\nretreats struck more of dismay than perhaps aught else. For, when swimming\nbefore his exulting pursuers, with every apparent symptom of alarm, he had\nseveral times been known to turn round suddenly, and, bearing down upon them,\neither stave their boats to splinters, or drive them back in consternation to\ntheir ship.\n\nAlready several fatalities had attended his chase. But though similar disasters,\nhowever little bruited ashore, were by no means unusual in the fishery; yet, in\nmost instances, such seemed the White Whale’s infernal aforethought of ferocity,\nthat every dismembering or death that he caused, was not wholly regarded as\nhaving been inflicted by an unintelligent agent.\n\nJudge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds of his more\ndesperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of chewed boats, and the\nsinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out of the white curds of the whale’s\ndireful wrath into the serene, exasperating sunlight, that smiled on, as if at a\nbirth or a bridal.\n\nHis three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in the eddies;\none captain, seizing the line-knife from his broken prow, had dashed at the\nwhale, as an Arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly seeking with a six inch blade\nto reach the fathom-deep life of the whale. That captain was Ahab. And then it\nwas, that suddenly sweeping his sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby Dick\nhad reaped away Ahab’s leg, as a mower a blade of grass in the field. No\nturbaned Turk, no hired Venetian or Malay, could have smote him with more\nseeming malice. Small reason was there to doubt, then, that ever since that\nalmost fatal encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the\nwhale, all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to\nidentify with him, not only all his bodily woes, but all his intellectual and\nspiritual exasperations. The White Whale swam before him as the monomaniac\nincarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel eating in\nthem, till they are left living on with half a heart and half a lung. That\nintangible malignity which has been from the beginning; to whose dominion even\nthe modern Christians ascribe one-half of the worlds; which the ancient Ophites\nof the east reverenced in their statue devil;—Ahab did not fall down and worship\nit like them; but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale,\nhe pitted himself, all mutilated, against it. All that most maddens and\ntorments; all that stirs up the lees of things; all truth with malice in it; all\nthat cracks the sinews and cakes the brain; all the subtle demonisms of life and\nthought; all evil, to crazy Ahab, were visibly personified, and made practically\nassailable in Moby Dick. He piled upon the whale’s white hump the sum of all the\ngeneral rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down; and then, as if his\nchest had been a mortar, he burst his hot heart’s shell upon it.\n\nIt is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at the\nprecise time of his bodily dismemberment. Then, in darting at the monster, knife\nin hand, he had but given loose to a sudden, passionate, corporal animosity; and\nwhen he received the stroke that tore him, he probably but felt the agonizing\nbodily laceration, but nothing more. Yet, when by this collision forced to turn\ntowards home, and for long months of days and weeks, Ahab and anguish lay\nstretched together in one hammock, rounding in mid winter that dreary, howling\nPatagonian Cape; then it was, that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one\nanother; and so interfusing, made him mad. That it was only then, on the\nhomeward voyage, after the encounter, that the final monomania seized him, seems\nall but certain from the fact that, at intervals during the passage, he was a\nraving lunatic; and, though unlimbed of a leg, yet such vital strength yet\nlurked in his Egyptian chest, and was moreover intensified by his delirium, that\nhis mates were forced to lace him fast, even there, as he sailed, raving in his\nhammock. In a strait-jacket, he swung to the mad rockings of the gales. And,\nwhen running into more sufferable latitudes, the ship, with mild stun’sails\nspread, floated across the tranquil tropics, and, to all appearances, the old\nman’s delirium seemed left behind him with the Cape Horn swells, and he came\nforth from his dark den into the blessed light and air; even then, when he bore\nthat firm, collected front, however pale, and issued his calm orders once again;\nand his mates thanked God the direful madness was now gone; even then, Ahab, in\nhis hidden self, raved on. Human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline\nthing. When you think it fled, it may have but become transfigured into some\nstill subtler form. Ahab’s full lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly contracted;\nlike the unabated Hudson, when that noble Northman flows narrowly, but\nunfathomably through the Highland gorge. But, as in his narrow-flowing\nmonomania, not one jot of Ahab’s broad madness had been left behind; so in that\nbroad madness, not one jot of his great natural intellect had perished. That\nbefore living agent, now became the living instrument. If such a furious trope\nmay stand, his special lunacy stormed his general sanity, and carried it, and\nturned all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark; so that far from having\nlost his strength, Ahab, to that one end, did now possess a thousand fold more\npotency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one reasonable object.\n\nThis is much; yet Ahab’s larger, darker, deeper part remains unhinted. But vain\nto popularize profundities, and all truth is profound. Winding far down from\nwithin the very heart of this spiked Hotel de Cluny where we here stand—however\ngrand and wonderful, now quit it;—and take your way, ye nobler, sadder souls, to\nthose vast Roman halls of Thermes; where far beneath the fantastic towers of\nman’s upper earth, his root of grandeur, his whole awful essence sits in bearded\nstate; an antique buried beneath antiquities, and throned on torsoes! So with a\nbroken throne, the great gods mock that captive king; so like a Caryatid, he\npatient sits, upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of ages. Wind\nye down there, ye prouder, sadder souls! question that proud, sad king! A family\nlikeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young exiled royalties; and from your grim\nsire only will the old State-secret come.\n\nNow, in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely: all my means are sane,\nmy motive and my object mad. Yet without power to kill, or change, or shun the\nfact; he likewise knew that to mankind he did long dissemble; in some sort, did\nstill. But that thing of his dissembling was only subject to his perceptibility,\nnot to his will determinate. Nevertheless, so well did he succeed in that\ndissembling, that when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last, no Nantucketer\nthought him otherwise than but naturally grieved, and that to the quick, with\nthe terrible casualty which had overtaken him.\n\nThe report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly ascribed to\na kindred cause. And so too, all the added moodiness which always afterwards, to\nthe very day of sailing in the Pequod on the present voyage, sat brooding on his\nbrow. Nor is it so very unlikely, that far from distrusting his fitness for\nanother whaling voyage, on account of such dark symptoms, the calculating people\nof that prudent isle were inclined to harbor the conceit, that for those very\nreasons he was all the better qualified and set on edge, for a pursuit so full\nof rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales. Gnawed within and scorched\nwithout, with the infixed, unrelenting fangs of some incurable idea; such an\none, could he be found, would seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his\nlance against the most appalling of all brutes. Or, if for any reason thought to\nbe corporeally incapacitated for that, yet such an one would seem superlatively\ncompetent to cheer and howl on his underlings to the attack. But be all this as\nit may, certain it is, that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up\nand keyed in him, Ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one\nonly and all-engrossing object of hunting the White Whale. Had any one of his\nold acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking in him then, how\nsoon would their aghast and righteous souls have wrenched the ship from such a\nfiendish man! They were bent on profitable cruises, the profit to be counted\ndown in dollars from the mint. He was intent on an audacious, immitigable, and\nsupernatural revenge.\n\nHere, then, was this grey-headed, ungodly old man, chasing with curses a Job’s\nwhale round the world, at the head of a crew, too, chiefly made up of mongrel\nrenegades, and castaways, and cannibals—morally enfeebled also, by the\nincompetence of mere unaided virtue or right-mindedness in Starbuck, the\ninvulnerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in Stubb, and the\npervading mediocrity in Flask. Such a crew, so officered, seemed specially\npicked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him to his monomaniac\nrevenge. How it was that they so aboundingly responded to the old man’s ire—by\nwhat evil magic their souls were possessed, that at times his hate seemed almost\ntheirs; the White Whale as much their insufferable foe as his; how all this came\nto be—what the White Whale was to them, or how to their unconscious\nunderstandings, also, in some dim, unsuspected way, he might have seemed the\ngliding great demon of the seas of life,—all this to explain, would be to dive\ndeeper than Ishmael can go. The subterranean miner that works in us all, how can\none tell whither leads his shaft by the ever shifting, muffled sound of his\npick? Who does not feel the irresistible arm drag? What skiff in tow of a\nseventy-four can stand still? For one, I gave myself up to the abandonment of\nthe time and the place; but while yet all a-rush to encounter the whale, could\nsee naught in that brute but the deadliest ill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 42. THE WHITENESS OF THE WHALE.\n\nWhat the white whale was to Ahab, has been hinted; what, at times, he was to me,\nas yet remains unsaid.\n\nAside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick, which could not\nbut occasionally awaken in any man’s soul some alarm, there was another thought,\nor rather vague, nameless horror concerning him, which at times by its intensity\ncompletely overpowered all the rest; and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable\nwas it, that I almost despair of putting it in a comprehensible form. It was the\nwhiteness of the whale that above all things appalled me. But how can I hope to\nexplain myself here; and yet, in some dim, random way, explain myself I must,\nelse all these chapters might be naught.\n\nThough in many natural objects, whiteness refiningly enhances beauty, as if\nimparting some special virtue of its own, as in marbles, japonicas, and pearls;\nand though various nations have in some way recognised a certain royal\npreeminence in this hue; even the barbaric, grand old kings of Pegu placing the\ntitle “Lord of the White Elephants” above all their other magniloquent\nascriptions of dominion; and the modern kings of Siam unfurling the same\nsnow-white quadruped in the royal standard; and the Hanoverian flag bearing the\none figure of a snow-white charger; and the great Austrian Empire, Cæsarian,\nheir to overlording Rome, having for the imperial colour the same imperial hue;\nand though this pre-eminence in it applies to the human race itself, giving the\nwhite man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe; and though, besides, all\nthis, whiteness has been even made significant of gladness, for among the Romans\na white stone marked a joyful day; and though in other mortal sympathies and\nsymbolizings, this same hue is made the emblem of many touching, noble\nthings—the innocence of brides, the benignity of age; though among the Red Men\nof America the giving of the white belt of wampum was the deepest pledge of\nhonor; though in many climes, whiteness typifies the majesty of Justice in the\nermine of the Judge, and contributes to the daily state of kings and queens\ndrawn by milk-white steeds; though even in the higher mysteries of the most\naugust religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness and\npower; by the Persian fire worshippers, the white forked flame being held the\nholiest on the altar; and in the Greek mythologies, Great Jove himself being\nmade incarnate in a snow-white bull; and though to the noble Iroquois, the\nmidwinter sacrifice of the sacred White Dog was by far the holiest festival of\ntheir theology, that spotless, faithful creature being held the purest envoy\nthey could send to the Great Spirit with the annual tidings of their own\nfidelity; and though directly from the Latin word for white, all Christian\npriests derive the name of one part of their sacred vesture, the alb or tunic,\nworn beneath the cassock; and though among the holy pomps of the Romish faith,\nwhite is specially employed in the celebration of the Passion of our Lord;\nthough in the Vision of St. John, white robes are given to the redeemed, and the\nfour-and-twenty elders stand clothed in white before the great white throne, and\nthe Holy One that sitteth there white like wool; yet for all these accumulated\nassociations, with whatever is sweet, and honorable, and sublime, there yet\nlurks an elusive something in the innermost idea of this hue, which strikes more\nof panic to the soul than that redness which affrights in blood.\n\nThis elusive quality it is, which causes the thought of whiteness, when divorced\nfrom more kindly associations, and coupled with any object terrible in itself,\nto heighten that terror to the furthest bounds. Witness the white bear of the\npoles, and the white shark of the tropics; what but their smooth, flaky\nwhiteness makes them the transcendent horrors they are? That ghastly whiteness\nit is which imparts such an abhorrent mildness, even more loathsome than\nterrific, to the dumb gloating of their aspect. So that not the fierce-fanged\ntiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the white-shrouded bear or\nshark.*\n\n*With reference to the Polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him who would\nfain go still deeper into this matter, that it is not the whiteness, separately\nregarded, which heightens the intolerable hideousness of that brute; for,\nanalysed, that heightened hideousness, it might be said, only rises from the\ncircumstance, that the irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands\ninvested in the fleece of celestial innocence and love; and hence, by bringing\ntogether two such opposite emotions in our minds, the Polar bear frightens us\nwith so unnatural a contrast. But even assuming all this to be true; yet, were\nit not for the whiteness, you would not have that intensified terror.\n\nAs for the white shark, the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that\ncreature, when beheld in his ordinary moods, strangely tallies with the same\nquality in the Polar quadruped. This peculiarity is most vividly hit by the\nFrench in the name they bestow upon that fish. The Romish mass for the dead\nbegins with “Requiem eternam” (eternal rest), whence Requiem denominating the\nmass itself, and any other funeral music. Now, in allusion to the white, silent\nstillness of death in this shark, and the mild deadliness of his habits, the\nFrench call him Requin.\n\nBethink thee of the albatross, whence come those clouds of spiritual wonderment\nand pale dread, in which that white phantom sails in all imaginations? Not\nColeridge first threw that spell; but God’s great, unflattering laureate,\nNature.*\n\n*I remember the first albatross I ever saw. It was during a prolonged gale, in\nwaters hard upon the Antarctic seas. From my forenoon watch below, I ascended to\nthe overclouded deck; and there, dashed upon the main hatches, I saw a regal,\nfeathery thing of unspotted whiteness, and with a hooked, Roman bill sublime. At\nintervals, it arched forth its vast archangel wings, as if to embrace some holy\nark. Wondrous flutterings and throbbings shook it. Though bodily unharmed, it\nuttered cries, as some king’s ghost in supernatural distress. Through its\ninexpressible, strange eyes, methought I peeped to secrets which took hold of\nGod. As Abraham before the angels, I bowed myself; the white thing was so white,\nits wings so wide, and in those for ever exiled waters, I had lost the miserable\nwarping memories of traditions and of towns. Long I gazed at that prodigy of\nplumage. I cannot tell, can only hint, the things that darted through me then.\nBut at last I awoke; and turning, asked a sailor what bird was this. A goney, he\nreplied. Goney! never had heard that name before; is it conceivable that this\nglorious thing is utterly unknown to men ashore! never! But some time after, I\nlearned that goney was some seaman’s name for albatross. So that by no\npossibility could Coleridge’s wild Rhyme have had aught to do with those\nmystical impressions which were mine, when I saw that bird upon our deck. For\nneither had I then read the Rhyme, nor knew the bird to be an albatross. Yet, in\nsaying this, I do but indirectly burnish a little brighter the noble merit of\nthe poem and the poet.\n\nI assert, then, that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird chiefly lurks\nthe secret of the spell; a truth the more evinced in this, that by a solecism of\nterms there are birds called grey albatrosses; and these I have frequently seen,\nbut never with such emotions as when I beheld the Antarctic fowl.\n\nBut how had the mystic thing been caught? Whisper it not, and I will tell; with\na treacherous hook and line, as the fowl floated on the sea. At last the Captain\nmade a postman of it; tying a lettered, leathern tally round its neck, with the\nship’s time and place; and then letting it escape. But I doubt not, that\nleathern tally, meant for man, was taken off in Heaven, when the white fowl flew\nto join the wing-folding, the invoking, and adoring cherubim!\n\nMost famous in our Western annals and Indian traditions is that of the White\nSteed of the Prairies; a magnificent milk-white charger, large-eyed,\nsmall-headed, bluff-chested, and with the dignity of a thousand monarchs in his\nlofty, overscorning carriage. He was the elected Xerxes of vast herds of wild\nhorses, whose pastures in those days were only fenced by the Rocky Mountains and\nthe Alleghanies. At their flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen\nstar which every evening leads on the hosts of light. The flashing cascade of\nhis mane, the curving comet of his tail, invested him with housings more\nresplendent than gold and silver-beaters could have furnished him. A most\nimperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen, western world, which to\nthe eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the glories of those primeval\ntimes when Adam walked majestic as a god, bluff-browed and fearless as this\nmighty steed. Whether marching amid his aides and marshals in the van of\ncountless cohorts that endlessly streamed it over the plains, like an Ohio; or\nwhether with his circumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon, the\nWhite Steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through his\ncool milkiness; in whatever aspect he presented himself, always to the bravest\nIndians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe. Nor can it be\nquestioned from what stands on legendary record of this noble horse, that it was\nhis spiritual whiteness chiefly, which so clothed him with divineness; and that\nthis divineness had that in it which, though commanding worship, at the same\ntime enforced a certain nameless terror.\n\nBut there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that accessory and\nstrange glory which invests it in the White Steed and Albatross.\n\nWhat is it that in the Albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks the eye,\nas that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin! It is that whiteness\nwhich invests him, a thing expressed by the name he bears. The Albino is as well\nmade as other men—has no substantive deformity—and yet this mere aspect of\nall-pervading whiteness makes him more strangely hideous than the ugliest\nabortion. Why should this be so?\n\nNor, in quite other aspects, does Nature in her least palpable but not the less\nmalicious agencies, fail to enlist among her forces this crowning attribute of\nthe terrible. From its snowy aspect, the gauntleted ghost of the Southern Seas\nhas been denominated the White Squall. Nor, in some historic instances, has the\nart of human malice omitted so potent an auxiliary. How wildly it heightens the\neffect of that passage in Froissart, when, masked in the snowy symbol of their\nfaction, the desperate White Hoods of Ghent murder their bailiff in the\nmarket-place!\n\nNor, in some things, does the common, hereditary experience of all mankind fail\nto bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue. It cannot well be doubted,\nthat the one visible quality in the aspect of the dead which most appals the\ngazer, is the marble pallor lingering there; as if indeed that pallor were as\nmuch like the badge of consternation in the other world, as of mortal\ntrepidation here. And from that pallor of the dead, we borrow the expressive hue\nof the shroud in which we wrap them. Nor even in our superstitions do we fail to\nthrow the same snowy mantle round our phantoms; all ghosts rising in a\nmilk-white fog—Yea, while these terrors seize us, let us add, that even the king\nof terrors, when personified by the evangelist, rides on his pallid horse.\n\nTherefore, in his other moods, symbolize whatever grand or gracious thing he\nwill by whiteness, no man can deny that in its profoundest idealized\nsignificance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul.\n\nBut though without dissent this point be fixed, how is mortal man to account for\nit? To analyse it, would seem impossible. Can we, then, by the citation of some\nof those instances wherein this thing of whiteness—though for the time either\nwholly or in great part stripped of all direct associations calculated to impart\nto it aught fearful, but nevertheless, is found to exert over us the same\nsorcery, however modified;—can we thus hope to light upon some chance clue to\nconduct us to the hidden cause we seek?\n\nLet us try. But in a matter like this, subtlety appeals to subtlety, and without\nimagination no man can follow another into these halls. And though, doubtless,\nsome at least of the imaginative impressions about to be presented may have been\nshared by most men, yet few perhaps were entirely conscious of them at the time,\nand therefore may not be able to recall them now.\n\nWhy to the man of untutored ideality, who happens to be but loosely acquainted\nwith the peculiar character of the day, does the bare mention of Whitsuntide\nmarshal in the fancy such long, dreary, speechless processions of slow-pacing\npilgrims, down-cast and hooded with new-fallen snow? Or, to the unread,\nunsophisticated Protestant of the Middle American States, why does the passing\nmention of a White Friar or a White Nun, evoke such an eyeless statue in the\nsoul?\n\nOr what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and kings\n(which will not wholly account for it) that makes the White Tower of London tell\nso much more strongly on the imagination of an untravelled American, than those\nother storied structures, its neighbors—the Byward Tower, or even the Bloody?\nAnd those sublimer towers, the White Mountains of New Hampshire, whence, in\npeculiar moods, comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare\nmention of that name, while the thought of Virginia’s Blue Ridge is full of a\nsoft, dewy, distant dreaminess? Or why, irrespective of all latitudes and\nlongitudes, does the name of the White Sea exert such a spectralness over the\nfancy, while that of the Yellow Sea lulls us with mortal thoughts of long\nlacquered mild afternoons on the waves, followed by the gaudiest and yet\nsleepiest of sunsets? Or, to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance, purely\naddressed to the fancy, why, in reading the old fairy tales of Central Europe,\ndoes “the tall pale man” of the Hartz forests, whose changeless pallor\nunrustlingly glides through the green of the groves—why is this phantom more\nterrible than all the whooping imps of the Blocksburg?\n\nNor is it, altogether, the remembrance of her cathedral-toppling earthquakes;\nnor the stampedoes of her frantic seas; nor the tearlessness of arid skies that\nnever rain; nor the sight of her wide field of leaning spires, wrenched\ncope-stones, and crosses all adroop (like canted yards of anchored fleets); and\nher suburban avenues of house-walls lying over upon each other, as a tossed pack\nof cards;—it is not these things alone which make tearless Lima, the strangest,\nsaddest city thou can’st see. For Lima has taken the white veil; and there is a\nhigher horror in this whiteness of her woe. Old as Pizarro, this whiteness keeps\nher ruins for ever new; admits not the cheerful greenness of complete decay;\nspreads over her broken ramparts the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its\nown distortions.\n\nI know that, to the common apprehension, this phenomenon of whiteness is not\nconfessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of objects otherwise\nterrible; nor to the unimaginative mind is there aught of terror in those\nappearances whose awfulness to another mind almost solely consists in this one\nphenomenon, especially when exhibited under any form at all approaching to\nmuteness or universality. What I mean by these two statements may perhaps be\nrespectively elucidated by the following examples.\n\nFirst: The mariner, when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands, if by night\nhe hear the roar of breakers, starts to vigilance, and feels just enough of\ntrepidation to sharpen all his faculties; but under precisely similar\ncircumstances, let him be called from his hammock to view his ship sailing\nthrough a midnight sea of milky whiteness—as if from encircling headlands shoals\nof combed white bears were swimming round him, then he feels a silent,\nsuperstitious dread; the shrouded phantom of the whitened waters is horrible to\nhim as a real ghost; in vain the lead assures him he is still off soundings;\nheart and helm they both go down; he never rests till blue water is under him\nagain. Yet where is the mariner who will tell thee, “Sir, it was not so much the\nfear of striking hidden rocks, as the fear of that hideous whiteness that so\nstirred me?”\n\nSecond: To the native Indian of Peru, the continual sight of the snow-howdahed\nAndes conveys naught of dread, except, perhaps, in the mere fancying of the\neternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast altitudes, and the natural\nconceit of what a fearfulness it would be to lose oneself in such inhuman\nsolitudes. Much the same is it with the backwoodsman of the West, who with\ncomparative indifference views an unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow, no\nshadow of tree or twig to break the fixed trance of whiteness. Not so the\nsailor, beholding the scenery of the Antarctic seas; where at times, by some\ninfernal trick of legerdemain in the powers of frost and air, he, shivering and\nhalf shipwrecked, instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his misery,\nviews what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with its lean ice\nmonuments and splintered crosses.\n\nBut thou sayest, methinks that white-lead chapter about whiteness is but a white\nflag hung out from a craven soul; thou surrenderest to a hypo, Ishmael.\n\nTell me, why this strong young colt, foaled in some peaceful valley of Vermont,\nfar removed from all beasts of prey—why is it that upon the sunniest day, if you\nbut shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him, so that he cannot even see it, but\nonly smells its wild animal muskiness—why will he start, snort, and with\nbursting eyes paw the ground in phrensies of affright? There is no remembrance\nin him of any gorings of wild creatures in his green northern home, so that the\nstrange muskiness he smells cannot recall to him anything associated with the\nexperience of former perils; for what knows he, this New England colt, of the\nblack bisons of distant Oregon?\n\nNo: but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute, the instinct of the knowledge\nof the demonism in the world. Though thousands of miles from Oregon, still when\nhe smells that savage musk, the rending, goring bison herds are as present as to\nthe deserted wild foal of the prairies, which this instant they may be trampling\ninto dust.\n\nThus, then, the muffled rollings of a milky sea; the bleak rustlings of the\nfestooned frosts of mountains; the desolate shiftings of the windrowed snows of\nprairies; all these, to Ishmael, are as the shaking of that buffalo robe to the\nfrightened colt!\n\nThough neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the mystic sign\ngives forth such hints; yet with me, as with the colt, somewhere those things\nmust exist. Though in many of its aspects this visible world seems formed in\nlove, the invisible spheres were formed in fright.\n\nBut not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness, and learned why it\nappeals with such power to the soul; and more strange and far more\nportentous—why, as we have seen, it is at once the most meaning symbol of\nspiritual things, nay, the very veil of the Christian’s Deity; and yet should be\nas it is, the intensifying agent in things the most appalling to mankind.\n\nIs it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids and\nimmensities of the universe, and thus stabs us from behind with the thought of\nannihilation, when beholding the white depths of the milky way? Or is it, that\nas in essence whiteness is not so much a colour as the visible absence of\ncolour; and at the same time the concrete of all colours; is it for these\nreasons that there is such a dumb blankness, full of meaning, in a wide\nlandscape of snows—a colourless, all-colour of atheism from which we shrink? And\nwhen we consider that other theory of the natural philosophers, that all other\nearthly hues—every stately or lovely emblazoning—the sweet tinges of sunset\nskies and woods; yea, and the gilded velvets of butterflies, and the butterfly\ncheeks of young girls; all these are but subtile deceits, not actually inherent\nin substances, but only laid on from without; so that all deified Nature\nabsolutely paints like the harlot, whose allurements cover nothing but the\ncharnel-house within; and when we proceed further, and consider that the\nmystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues, the great principle of\nlight, for ever remains white or colorless in itself, and if operating without\nmedium upon matter, would touch all objects, even tulips and roses, with its own\nblank tinge—pondering all this, the palsied universe lies before us a leper; and\nlike wilful travellers in Lapland, who refuse to wear coloured and colouring\nglasses upon their eyes, so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at the\nmonumental white shroud that wraps all the prospect around him. And of all these\nthings the Albino whale was the symbol. Wonder ye then at the fiery hunt?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 43. HARK!\n\n“HIST! Did you hear that noise, Cabaco?”\n\nIt was the middle-watch: a fair moonlight; the seamen were standing in a cordon,\nextending from one of the fresh-water butts in the waist, to the scuttle-butt\nnear the taffrail. In this manner, they passed the buckets to fill the\nscuttle-butt. Standing, for the most part, on the hallowed precincts of the\nquarter-deck, they were careful not to speak or rustle their feet. From hand to\nhand, the buckets went in the deepest silence, only broken by the occasional\nflap of a sail, and the steady hum of the unceasingly advancing keel.\n\nIt was in the midst of this repose, that Archy, one of the cordon, whose post\nwas near the after-hatches, whispered to his neighbor, a Cholo, the words above.\n\n“Hist! did you hear that noise, Cabaco?”\n\n“Take the bucket, will ye, Archy? what noise d’ye mean?”\n\n“There it is again—under the hatches—don’t you hear it—a cough—it sounded like a\ncough.”\n\n“Cough be damned! Pass along that return bucket.”\n\n“There again—there it is!—it sounds like two or three sleepers turning over,\nnow!”\n\n“Caramba! have done, shipmate, will ye? It’s the three soaked biscuits ye eat\nfor supper turning over inside of ye—nothing else. Look to the bucket!”\n\n“Say what ye will, shipmate; I’ve sharp ears.”\n\n“Aye, you are the chap, ain’t ye, that heard the hum of the old Quakeress’s\nknitting-needles fifty miles at sea from Nantucket; you’re the chap.”\n\n“Grin away; we’ll see what turns up. Hark ye, Cabaco, there is somebody down in\nthe after-hold that has not yet been seen on deck; and I suspect our old Mogul\nknows something of it too. I heard Stubb tell Flask, one morning watch, that\nthere was something of that sort in the wind.”\n\n“Tish! the bucket!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 44. THE CHART.\n\nHad you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall that took\nplace on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his purpose with his\ncrew, you would have seen him go to a locker in the transom, and bringing out a\nlarge wrinkled roll of yellowish sea charts, spread them before him on his\nscrewed-down table. Then seating himself before it, you would have seen him\nintently study the various lines and shadings which there met his eye; and with\nslow but steady pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were\nblank. At intervals, he would refer to piles of old log-books beside him,\nwherein were set down the seasons and places in which, on various former voyages\nof various ships, sperm whales had been captured or seen.\n\nWhile thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his head,\ncontinually rocked with the motion of the ship, and for ever threw shifting\ngleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow, till it almost seemed that\nwhile he himself was marking out lines and courses on the wrinkled charts, some\ninvisible pencil was also tracing lines and courses upon the deeply marked chart\nof his forehead.\n\nBut it was not this night in particular that, in the solitude of his cabin, Ahab\nthus pondered over his charts. Almost every night they were brought out; almost\nevery night some pencil marks were effaced, and others were substituted. For\nwith the charts of all four oceans before him, Ahab was threading a maze of\ncurrents and eddies, with a view to the more certain accomplishment of that\nmonomaniac thought of his soul.\n\nNow, to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans, it might\nseem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary creature in the\nunhooped oceans of this planet. But not so did it seem to Ahab, who knew the\nsets of all tides and currents; and thereby calculating the driftings of the\nsperm whale’s food; and, also, calling to mind the regular, ascertained seasons\nfor hunting him in particular latitudes; could arrive at reasonable surmises,\nalmost approaching to certainties, concerning the timeliest day to be upon this\nor that ground in search of his prey.\n\nSo assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the sperm\nwhale’s resorting to given waters, that many hunters believe that, could he be\nclosely observed and studied throughout the world; were the logs for one voyage\nof the entire whale fleet carefully collated, then the migrations of the sperm\nwhale would be found to correspond in invariability to those of the\nherring-shoals or the flights of swallows. On this hint, attempts have been made\nto construct elaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale.*\n\n     *Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne\n     out by an official circular, issued by Lieutenant Maury, of\n     the National Observatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851. By\n     that circular, it appears that precisely such a chart is in\n     course of completion; and portions of it are presented in\n     the circular. “This chart divides the ocean into districts\n     of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of longitude;\n     perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve\n     columns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each\n     of which districts are three lines; one to show the number\n     of days that have been spent in each month in every\n     district, and the two others to show the number of days in\n     which whales, sperm or right, have been seen.”\n \n\nBesides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another, the sperm\nwhales, guided by some infallible instinct—say, rather, secret intelligence from\nthe Deity—mostly swim in veins, as they are called; continuing their way along a\ngiven ocean-line with such undeviating exactitude, that no ship ever sailed her\ncourse, by any chart, with one tithe of such marvellous precision. Though, in\nthese cases, the direction taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyor’s\nparallel, and though the line of advance be strictly confined to its own\nunavoidable, straight wake, yet the arbitrary vein in which at these times he is\nsaid to swim, generally embraces some few miles in width (more or less, as the\nvein is presumed to expand or contract); but never exceeds the visual sweep from\nthe whale-ship’s mast-heads, when circumspectly gliding along this magic zone.\nThe sum is, that at particular seasons within that breadth and along that path,\nmigrating whales may with great confidence be looked for.\n\nAnd hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate\nfeeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in crossing the\nwidest expanses of water between those grounds he could, by his art, so place\nand time himself on his way, as even then not to be wholly without prospect of a\nmeeting.\n\nThere was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his delirious\nbut still methodical scheme. But not so in the reality, perhaps. Though the\ngregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons for particular grounds, yet\nin general you cannot conclude that the herds which haunted such and such a\nlatitude or longitude this year, say, will turn out to be identically the same\nwith those that were found there the preceding season; though there are peculiar\nand unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved true. In\ngeneral, the same remark, only within a less wide limit, applies to the\nsolitaries and hermits among the matured, aged sperm whales. So that though Moby\nDick had in a former year been seen, for example, on what is called the\nSeychelle ground in the Indian ocean, or Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast; yet\nit did not follow, that were the Pequod to visit either of those spots at any\nsubsequent corresponding season, she would infallibly encounter him there. So,\ntoo, with some other feeding grounds, where he had at times revealed himself.\nBut all these seemed only his casual stopping-places and ocean-inns, so to\nspeak, not his places of prolonged abode. And where Ahab’s chances of\naccomplishing his object have hitherto been spoken of, allusion has only been\nmade to whatever way-side, antecedent, extra prospects were his, ere a\nparticular set time or place were attained, when all possibilities would become\nprobabilities, and, as Ahab fondly thought, every possibility the next thing to\na certainty. That particular set time and place were conjoined in the one\ntechnical phrase—the Season-on-the-Line. For there and then, for several\nconsecutive years, Moby Dick had been periodically descried, lingering in those\nwaters for awhile, as the sun, in its annual round, loiters for a predicted\ninterval in any one sign of the Zodiac. There it was, too, that most of the\ndeadly encounters with the white whale had taken place; there the waves were\nstoried with his deeds; there also was that tragic spot where the monomaniac old\nman had found the awful motive to his vengeance. But in the cautious\ncomprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with which Ahab threw his brooding\nsoul into this unfaltering hunt, he would not permit himself to rest all his\nhopes upon the one crowning fact above mentioned, however flattering it might be\nto those hopes; nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his\nunquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest.\n\nNow, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of the\nSeason-on-the-Line. No possible endeavor then could enable her commander to make\nthe great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, and then running down sixty\ndegrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial Pacific in time to cruise there.\nTherefore, he must wait for the next ensuing season. Yet the premature hour of\nthe Pequod’s sailing had, perhaps, been correctly selected by Ahab, with a view\nto this very complexion of things. Because, an interval of three hundred and\nsixty-five days and nights was before him; an interval which, instead of\nimpatiently enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt; if by\nchance the White Whale, spending his vacation in seas far remote from his\nperiodical feeding-grounds, should turn up his wrinkled brow off the Persian\nGulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or China Seas, or in any other waters haunted by his\nrace. So that Monsoons, Pampas, Nor’-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; any wind but\nthe Levanter and Simoon, might blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag\nworld-circle of the Pequod’s circumnavigating wake.\n\nBut granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it not but a\nmad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean, one solitary whale, even if\nencountered, should be thought capable of individual recognition from his\nhunter, even as a white-bearded Mufti in the thronged thoroughfares of\nConstantinople? Yes. For the peculiar snow-white brow of Moby Dick, and his\nsnow-white hump, could not but be unmistakable. And have I not tallied the\nwhale, Ahab would mutter to himself, as after poring over his charts till long\nafter midnight he would throw himself back in reveries—tallied him, and shall he\nescape? His broad fins are bored, and scalloped out like a lost sheep’s ear! And\nhere, his mad mind would run on in a breathless race; till a weariness and\nfaintness of pondering came over him; and in the open air of the deck he would\nseek to recover his strength. Ah, God! what trances of torments does that man\nendure who is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire. He sleeps with\nclenched hands; and wakes with his own bloody nails in his palms.\n\nOften, when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid dreams\nof the night, which, resuming his own intense thoughts through the day, carried\nthem on amid a clashing of phrensies, and whirled them round and round and round\nin his blazing brain, till the very throbbing of his life-spot became\ninsufferable anguish; and when, as was sometimes the case, these spiritual\nthroes in him heaved his being up from its base, and a chasm seemed opening in\nhim, from which forked flames and lightnings shot up, and accursed fiends\nbeckoned him to leap down among them; when this hell in himself yawned beneath\nhim, a wild cry would be heard through the ship; and with glaring eyes Ahab\nwould burst from his state room, as though escaping from a bed that was on fire.\nYet these, perhaps, instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent\nweakness, or fright at his own resolve, were but the plainest tokens of its\nintensity. For, at such times, crazy Ahab, the scheming, unappeasedly steadfast\nhunter of the white whale; this Ahab that had gone to his hammock, was not the\nagent that so caused him to burst from it in horror again. The latter was the\neternal, living principle or soul in him; and in sleep, being for the time\ndissociated from the characterizing mind, which at other times employed it for\nits outer vehicle or agent, it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching\ncontiguity of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it was no longer an\nintegral. But as the mind does not exist unless leagued with the soul, therefore\nit must have been that, in Ahab’s case, yielding up all his thoughts and fancies\nto his one supreme purpose; that purpose, by its own sheer inveteracy of will,\nforced itself against gods and devils into a kind of self-assumed, independent\nbeing of its own. Nay, could grimly live and burn, while the common vitality to\nwhich it was conjoined, fled horror-stricken from the unbidden and unfathered\nbirth. Therefore, the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eyes, when what\nseemed Ahab rushed from his room, was for the time but a vacated thing, a\nformless somnambulistic being, a ray of living light, to be sure, but without an\nobject to colour, and therefore a blankness in itself. God help thee, old man,\nthy thoughts have created a creature in thee; and he whose intense thinking thus\nmakes him a Prometheus; a vulture feeds upon that heart for ever; that vulture\nthe very creature he creates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 45. THE AFFIDAVIT.\n\nSo far as what there may be of a narrative in this book; and, indeed, as\nindirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious particulars in the\nhabits of sperm whales, the foregoing chapter, in its earlier part, is as\nimportant a one as will be found in this volume; but the leading matter of it\nrequires to be still further and more familiarly enlarged upon, in order to be\nadequately understood, and moreover to take away any incredulity which a\nprofound ignorance of the entire subject may induce in some minds, as to the\nnatural verity of the main points of this affair.\n\nI care not to perform this part of my task methodically; but shall be content to\nproduce the desired impression by separate citations of items, practically or\nreliably known to me as a whaleman; and from these citations, I take it—the\nconclusion aimed at will naturally follow of itself.\n\nFirst: I have personally known three instances where a whale, after receiving a\nharpoon, has effected a complete escape; and, after an interval (in one instance\nof three years), has been again struck by the same hand, and slain; when the two\nirons, both marked by the same private cypher, have been taken from the body. In\nthe instance where three years intervened between the flinging of the two\nharpoons; and I think it may have been something more than that; the man who\ndarted them happening, in the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage to\nAfrica, went ashore there, joined a discovery party, and penetrated far into the\ninterior, where he travelled for a period of nearly two years, often endangered\nby serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas, with all the other common\nperils incident to wandering in the heart of unknown regions. Meanwhile, the\nwhale he had struck must also have been on its travels; no doubt it had thrice\ncircumnavigated the globe, brushing with its flanks all the coasts of Africa;\nbut to no purpose. This man and this whale again came together, and the one\nvanquished the other. I say I, myself, have known three instances similar to\nthis; that is in two of them I saw the whales struck; and, upon the second\nattack, saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them, afterwards\ntaken from the dead fish. In the three-year instance, it so fell out that I was\nin the boat both times, first and last, and the last time distinctly recognised\na peculiar sort of huge mole under the whale’s eye, which I had observed there\nthree years previous. I say three years, but I am pretty sure it was more than\nthat. Here are three instances, then, which I personally know the truth of; but\nI have heard of many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter\nthere is no good ground to impeach.\n\nSecondly: It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery, however ignorant the\nworld ashore may be of it, that there have been several memorable historical\ninstances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at distant times and\nplaces popularly cognisable. Why such a whale became thus marked was not\naltogether and originally owing to his bodily peculiarities as distinguished\nfrom other whales; for however peculiar in that respect any chance whale may be,\nthey soon put an end to his peculiarities by killing him, and boiling him down\ninto a peculiarly valuable oil. No: the reason was this: that from the fatal\nexperiences of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about\nsuch a whale as there did about Rinaldo Rinaldini, insomuch that most fishermen\nwere content to recognise him by merely touching their tarpaulins when he would\nbe discovered lounging by them on the sea, without seeking to cultivate a more\nintimate acquaintance. Like some poor devils ashore that happen to know an\nirascible great man, they make distant unobtrusive salutations to him in the\nstreet, lest if they pursued the acquaintance further, they might receive a\nsummary thump for their presumption.\n\nBut not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual\ncelebrity—Nay, you may call it an ocean-wide renown; not only was he famous in\nlife and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death, but he was admitted\ninto all the rights, privileges, and distinctions of a name; had as much a name\nindeed as Cambyses or Cæsar. Was it not so, O Timor Tom! thou famed leviathan,\nscarred like an iceberg, who so long did’st lurk in the Oriental straits of that\nname, whose spout was oft seen from the palmy beach of Ombay? Was it not so, O\nNew Zealand Jack! thou terror of all cruisers that crossed their wakes in the\nvicinity of the Tattoo Land? Was it not so, O Morquan! King of Japan, whose\nlofty jet they say at times assumed the semblance of a snow-white cross against\nthe sky? Was it not so, O Don Miguel! thou Chilian whale, marked like an old\ntortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back! In plain prose, here are four\nwhales as well known to the students of Cetacean History as Marius or Sylla to\nthe classic scholar.\n\nBut this is not all. New Zealand Tom and Don Miguel, after at various times\ncreating great havoc among the boats of different vessels, were finally gone in\nquest of, systematically hunted out, chased and killed by valiant whaling\ncaptains, who heaved up their anchors with that express object as much in view,\nas in setting out through the Narragansett Woods, Captain Butler of old had it\nin his mind to capture that notorious murderous savage Annawon, the headmost\nwarrior of the Indian King Philip.\n\nI do not know where I can find a better place than just here, to make mention of\none or two other things, which to me seem important, as in printed form\nestablishing in all respects the reasonableness of the whole story of the White\nWhale, more especially the catastrophe. For this is one of those disheartening\ninstances where truth requires full as much bolstering as error. So ignorant are\nmost landsmen of some of the plainest and most palpable wonders of the world,\nthat without some hints touching the plain facts, historical and otherwise, of\nthe fishery, they might scout at Moby Dick as a monstrous fable, or still worse\nand more detestable, a hideous and intolerable allegory.\n\nFirst: Though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general perils of\nthe grand fishery, yet they have nothing like a fixed, vivid conception of those\nperils, and the frequency with which they recur. One reason perhaps is, that not\none in fifty of the actual disasters and deaths by casualties in the fishery,\never finds a public record at home, however transient and immediately forgotten\nthat record. Do you suppose that that poor fellow there, who this moment perhaps\ncaught by the whale-line off the coast of New Guinea, is being carried down to\nthe bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan—do you suppose that that poor\nfellow’s name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will read to-morrow at\nyour breakfast? No: because the mails are very irregular between here and New\nGuinea. In fact, did you ever hear what might be called regular news direct or\nindirect from New Guinea? Yet I tell you that upon one particular voyage which I\nmade to the Pacific, among many others we spoke thirty different ships, every\none of which had had a death by a whale, some of them more than one, and three\nthat had each lost a boat’s crew. For God’s sake, be economical with your lamps\nand candles! not a gallon you burn, but at least one drop of man’s blood was\nspilled for it.\n\nSecondly: People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale is an\nenormous creature of enormous power; but I have ever found that when narrating\nto them some specific example of this two-fold enormousness, they have\nsignificantly complimented me upon my facetiousness; when, I declare upon my\nsoul, I had no more idea of being facetious than Moses, when he wrote the\nhistory of the plagues of Egypt.\n\nBut fortunately the special point I here seek can be established upon testimony\nentirely independent of my own. That point is this: The Sperm Whale is in some\ncases sufficiently powerful, knowing, and judiciously malicious, as with direct\naforethought to stave in, utterly destroy, and sink a large ship; and what is\nmore, the Sperm Whale has done it.\n\nFirst: In the year 1820 the ship Essex, Captain Pollard, of Nantucket, was\ncruising in the Pacific Ocean. One day she saw spouts, lowered her boats, and\ngave chase to a shoal of sperm whales. Ere long, several of the whales were\nwounded; when, suddenly, a very large whale escaping from the boats, issued from\nthe shoal, and bore directly down upon the ship. Dashing his forehead against\nher hull, he so stove her in, that in less than “ten minutes” she settled down\nand fell over. Not a surviving plank of her has been seen since. After the\nseverest exposure, part of the crew reached the land in their boats. Being\nreturned home at last, Captain Pollard once more sailed for the Pacific in\ncommand of another ship, but the gods shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks\nand breakers; for the second time his ship was utterly lost, and forthwith\nforswearing the sea, he has never tempted it since. At this day Captain Pollard\nis a resident of Nantucket. I have seen Owen Chace, who was chief mate of the\nEssex at the time of the tragedy; I have read his plain and faithful narrative;\nI have conversed with his son; and all this within a few miles of the scene of\nthe catastrophe.*\n\n*The following are extracts from Chace’s narrative: “Every fact seemed to\nwarrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which directed his\noperations; he made two several attacks upon the ship, at a short interval\nbetween them, both of which, according to their direction, were calculated to do\nus the most injury, by being made ahead, and thereby combining the speed of the\ntwo objects for the shock; to effect which, the exact manœuvres which he made\nwere necessary. His aspect was most horrible, and such as indicated resentment\nand fury. He came directly from the shoal which we had just before entered, and\nin which we had struck three of his companions, as if fired with revenge for\ntheir sufferings.” Again: “At all events, the whole circumstances taken\ntogether, all happening before my own eyes, and producing, at the time,\nimpressions in my mind of decided, calculating mischief, on the part of the\nwhale (many of which impressions I cannot now recall), induce me to be satisfied\nthat I am correct in my opinion.”\n\nHere are his reflections some time after quitting the ship, during a black night\nin an open boat, when almost despairing of reaching any hospitable shore. “The\ndark ocean and swelling waters were nothing; the fears of being swallowed up by\nsome dreadful tempest, or dashed upon hidden rocks, with all the other ordinary\nsubjects of fearful contemplation, seemed scarcely entitled to a moment’s\nthought; the dismal looking wreck, and the horrid aspect and revenge of the\nwhale, wholly engrossed my reflections, until day again made its appearance.”\n\nIn another place—p. 45,—he speaks of “the mysterious and mortal attack of the\nanimal.”\n\nSecondly: The ship Union, also of Nantucket, was in the year 1807 totally lost\noff the Azores by a similar onset, but the authentic particulars of this\ncatastrophe I have never chanced to encounter, though from the whale hunters I\nhave now and then heard casual allusions to it.\n\nThirdly: Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore J——, then commanding an\nAmerican sloop-of-war of the first class, happened to be dining with a party of\nwhaling captains, on board a Nantucket ship in the harbor of Oahu, Sandwich\nIslands. Conversation turning upon whales, the Commodore was pleased to be\nsceptical touching the amazing strength ascribed to them by the professional\ngentlemen present. He peremptorily denied for example, that any whale could so\nsmite his stout sloop-of-war as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful.\nVery good; but there is more coming. Some weeks after, the Commodore set sail in\nthis impregnable craft for Valparaiso. But he was stopped on the way by a portly\nsperm whale, that begged a few moments’ confidential business with him. That\nbusiness consisted in fetching the Commodore’s craft such a thwack, that with\nall his pumps going he made straight for the nearest port to heave down and\nrepair. I am not superstitious, but I consider the Commodore’s interview with\nthat whale as providential. Was not Saul of Tarsus converted from unbelief by a\nsimilar fright? I tell you, the sperm whale will stand no nonsense.\n\nI will now refer you to Langsdorff’s Voyages for a little circumstance in point,\npeculiarly interesting to the writer hereof. Langsdorff, you must know by the\nway, was attached to the Russian Admiral Krusenstern’s famous Discovery\nExpedition in the beginning of the present century. Captain Langsdorff thus\nbegins his seventeenth chapter:\n\n“By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail, and the next day we were\nout in the open sea, on our way to Ochotsh. The weather was very clear and fine,\nbut so intolerably cold that we were obliged to keep on our fur clothing. For\nsome days we had very little wind; it was not till the nineteenth that a brisk\ngale from the northwest sprang up. An uncommon large whale, the body of which\nwas larger than the ship itself, lay almost at the surface of the water, but was\nnot perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship, which was in\nfull sail, was almost upon him, so that it was impossible to prevent its\nstriking against him. We were thus placed in the most imminent danger, as this\ngigantic creature, setting up its back, raised the ship three feet at least out\nof the water. The masts reeled, and the sails fell altogether, while we who were\nbelow all sprang instantly upon the deck, concluding that we had struck upon\nsome rock; instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with the utmost\ngravity and solemnity. Captain D’Wolf applied immediately to the pumps to\nexamine whether or not the vessel had received any damage from the shock, but we\nfound that very happily it had escaped entirely uninjured.”\n\nNow, the Captain D’Wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in question, is a\nNew Englander, who, after a long life of unusual adventures as a sea-captain,\nthis day resides in the village of Dorchester near Boston. I have the honor of\nbeing a nephew of his. I have particularly questioned him concerning this\npassage in Langsdorff. He substantiates every word. The ship, however, was by no\nmeans a large one: a Russian craft built on the Siberian coast, and purchased by\nmy uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home.\n\nIn that up and down manly book of old-fashioned adventure, so full, too, of\nhonest wonders—the voyage of Lionel Wafer, one of ancient Dampier’s old chums—I\nfound a little matter set down so like that just quoted from Langsdorff, that I\ncannot forbear inserting it here for a corroborative example, if such be needed.\n\nLionel, it seems, was on his way to “John Ferdinando,” as he calls the modern\nJuan Fernandes. “In our way thither,” he says, “about four o’clock in the\nmorning, when we were about one hundred and fifty leagues from the Main of\nAmerica, our ship felt a terrible shock, which put our men in such consternation\nthat they could hardly tell where they were or what to think; but every one\nbegan to prepare for death. And, indeed, the shock was so sudden and violent,\nthat we took it for granted the ship had struck against a rock; but when the\namazement was a little over, we cast the lead, and sounded, but found no ground.\n* * * * * The suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in their carriages, and\nseveral of the men were shaken out of their hammocks. Captain Davis, who lay\nwith his head on a gun, was thrown out of his cabin!” Lionel then goes on to\nimpute the shock to an earthquake, and seems to substantiate the imputation by\nstating that a great earthquake, somewhere about that time, did actually do\ngreat mischief along the Spanish land. But I should not much wonder if, in the\ndarkness of that early hour of the morning, the shock was after all caused by an\nunseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath.\n\nI might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known to me, of\nthe great power and malice at times of the sperm whale. In more than one\ninstance, he has been known, not only to chase the assailing boats back to their\nships, but to pursue the ship itself, and long withstand all the lances hurled\nat him from its decks. The English ship Pusie Hall can tell a story on that\nhead; and, as for his strength, let me say, that there have been examples where\nthe lines attached to a running sperm whale have, in a calm, been transferred to\nthe ship, and secured there; the whale towing her great hull through the water,\nas a horse walks off with a cart. Again, it is very often observed that, if the\nsperm whale, once struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts, not so often\nwith blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of destruction to his\npursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his character,\nthat upon being attacked he will frequently open his mouth, and retain it in\nthat dread expansion for several consecutive minutes. But I must be content with\nonly one more and a concluding illustration; a remarkable and most significant\none, by which you will not fail to see, that not only is the most marvellous\nevent in this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day, but that\nthese marvels (like all marvels) are mere repetitions of the ages; so that for\nthe millionth time we say amen with Solomon—Verily there is nothing new under\nthe sun.\n\nIn the sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a Christian magistrate of\nConstantinople, in the days when Justinian was Emperor and Belisarius general.\nAs many know, he wrote the history of his own times, a work every way of\nuncommon value. By the best authorities, he has always been considered a most\ntrustworthy and unexaggerating historian, except in some one or two particulars,\nnot at all affecting the matter presently to be mentioned.\n\nNow, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, during the term of his\nprefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured in the\nneighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having destroyed vessels at\nintervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty years. A fact thus set\ndown in substantial history cannot easily be gainsaid. Nor is there any reason\nit should be. Of what precise species this sea-monster was, is not mentioned.\nBut as he destroyed ships, as well as for other reasons, he must have been a\nwhale; and I am strongly inclined to think a sperm whale. And I will tell you\nwhy. For a long time I fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in\nthe Mediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it. Even now I am certain\nthat those seas are not, and perhaps never can be, in the present constitution\nof things, a place for his habitual gregarious resort. But further\ninvestigations have recently proved to me, that in modern times there have been\nisolated instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the Mediterranean. I am\ntold, on good authority, that on the Barbary coast, a Commodore Davis of the\nBritish navy found the skeleton of a sperm whale. Now, as a vessel of war\nreadily passes through the Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by the same\nroute, pass out of the Mediterranean into the Propontis.\n\nIn the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar substance called\nbrit is to be found, the aliment of the right whale. But I have every reason to\nbelieve that the food of the sperm whale—squid or cuttle-fish—lurks at the\nbottom of that sea, because large creatures, but by no means the largest of that\nsort, have been found at its surface. If, then, you properly put these\nstatements together, and reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that,\naccording to all human reasoning, Procopius’s sea-monster, that for half a\ncentury stove the ships of a Roman Emperor, must in all probability have been a\nsperm whale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 46. SURMISES.\n\nThough, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, Ahab in all his thoughts and\nactions ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby Dick; though he seemed\nready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that one passion; nevertheless it may\nhave been that he was by nature and long habituation far too wedded to a fiery\nwhaleman’s ways, altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage.\nOr at least if this were otherwise, there were not wanting other motives much\nmore influential with him. It would be refining too much, perhaps, even\nconsidering his monomania, to hint that his vindictiveness towards the White\nWhale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all sperm whales,\nand that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he multiplied the chances\nthat each subsequently encountered whale would prove to be the hated one he\nhunted. But if such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable, there were still\nadditional considerations which, though not so strictly according with the\nwildness of his ruling passion, yet were by no means incapable of swaying him.\n\nTo accomplish his object Ahab must use tools; and of all tools used in the\nshadow of the moon, men are most apt to get out of order. He knew, for example,\nthat however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was over Starbuck, yet\nthat ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual man any more than mere\ncorporeal superiority involves intellectual mastership; for to the purely\nspiritual, the intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal relation.\nStarbuck’s body and Starbuck’s coerced will were Ahab’s, so long as Ahab kept\nhis magnet at Starbuck’s brain; still he knew that for all this the chief mate,\nin his soul, abhorred his captain’s quest, and could he, would joyfully\ndisintegrate himself from it, or even frustrate it. It might be that a long\ninterval would elapse ere the White Whale was seen. During that long interval\nStarbuck would ever be apt to fall into open relapses of rebellion against his\ncaptain’s leadership, unless some ordinary, prudential, circumstantial\ninfluences were brought to bear upon him. Not only that, but the subtle insanity\nof Ahab respecting Moby Dick was noways more significantly manifested than in\nhis superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing that, for the present, the\nhunt should in some way be stripped of that strange imaginative impiousness\nwhich naturally invested it; that the full terror of the voyage must be kept\nwithdrawn into the obscure background (for few men’s courage is proof against\nprotracted meditation unrelieved by action); that when they stood their long\nnight watches, his officers and men must have some nearer things to think of\nthan Moby Dick. For however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had hailed\nthe announcement of his quest; yet all sailors of all sorts are more or less\ncapricious and unreliable—they live in the varying outer weather, and they\ninhale its fickleness—and when retained for any object remote and blank in the\npursuit, however promissory of life and passion in the end, it is above all\nthings requisite that temporary interests and employments should intervene and\nhold them healthily suspended for the final dash.\n\nNor was Ahab unmindful of another thing. In times of strong emotion mankind\ndisdain all base considerations; but such times are evanescent. The permanent\nconstitutional condition of the manufactured man, thought Ahab, is sordidness.\nGranting that the White Whale fully incites the hearts of this my savage crew,\nand playing round their savageness even breeds a certain generous\nknight-errantism in them, still, while for the love of it they give chase to\nMoby Dick, they must also have food for their more common, daily appetites. For\neven the high lifted and chivalric Crusaders of old times were not content to\ntraverse two thousand miles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre, without\ncommitting burglaries, picking pockets, and gaining other pious perquisites by\nthe way. Had they been strictly held to their one final and romantic object—that\nfinal and romantic object, too many would have turned from in disgust. I will\nnot strip these men, thought Ahab, of all hopes of cash—aye, cash. They may\nscorn cash now; but let some months go by, and no perspective promise of it to\nthem, and then this same quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them, this same\ncash would soon cashier Ahab.\n\nNor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related to Ahab\npersonally. Having impulsively, it is probable, and perhaps somewhat prematurely\nrevealed the prime but private purpose of the Pequod’s voyage, Ahab was now\nentirely conscious that, in so doing, he had indirectly laid himself open to the\nunanswerable charge of usurpation; and with perfect impunity, both moral and\nlegal, his crew if so disposed, and to that end competent, could refuse all\nfurther obedience to him, and even violently wrest from him the command. From\neven the barely hinted imputation of usurpation, and the possible consequences\nof such a suppressed impression gaining ground, Ahab must of course have been\nmost anxious to protect himself. That protection could only consist in his own\npredominating brain and heart and hand, backed by a heedful, closely calculating\nattention to every minute atmospheric influence which it was possible for his\ncrew to be subjected to.\n\nFor all these reasons then, and others perhaps too analytic to be verbally\ndeveloped here, Ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good degree continue\ntrue to the natural, nominal purpose of the Pequod’s voyage; observe all\ncustomary usages; and not only that, but force himself to evince all his well\nknown passionate interest in the general pursuit of his profession.\n\nBe all this as it may, his voice was now often heard hailing the three\nmast-heads and admonishing them to keep a bright look-out, and not omit\nreporting even a porpoise. This vigilance was not long without reward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 47. THE MAT-MAKER.\n\nIt was a cloudy, sultry afternoon; the seamen were lazily lounging about the\ndecks, or vacantly gazing over into the lead-coloured waters. Queequeg and I\nwere mildly employed weaving what is called a sword-mat, for an additional\nlashing to our boat. So still and subdued and yet somehow preluding was all the\nscene, and such an incantation of reverie lurked in the air, that each silent\nsailor seemed resolved into his own invisible self.\n\nI was the attendant or page of Queequeg, while busy at the mat. As I kept\npassing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the long yarns of\nthe warp, using my own hand for the shuttle, and as Queequeg, standing sideways,\never and anon slid his heavy oaken sword between the threads, and idly looking\noff upon the water, carelessly and unthinkingly drove home every yarn: I say so\nstrange a dreaminess did there then reign all over the ship and all over the\nsea, only broken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword, that it seemed as\nif this were the Loom of Time, and I myself were a shuttle mechanically weaving\nand weaving away at the Fates. There lay the fixed threads of the warp subject\nto but one single, ever returning, unchanging vibration, and that vibration\nmerely enough to admit of the crosswise interblending of other threads with its\nown. This warp seemed necessity; and here, thought I, with my own hand I ply my\nown shuttle and weave my own destiny into these unalterable threads. Meantime,\nQueequeg’s impulsive, indifferent sword, sometimes hitting the woof slantingly,\nor crookedly, or strongly, or weakly, as the case might be; and by this\ndifference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding contrast in the\nfinal aspect of the completed fabric; this savage’s sword, thought I, which thus\nfinally shapes and fashions both warp and woof; this easy, indifferent sword\nmust be chance—aye, chance, free will, and necessity—nowise incompatible—all\ninterweavingly working together. The straight warp of necessity, not to be\nswerved from its ultimate course—its every alternating vibration, indeed, only\ntending to that; free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads;\nand chance, though restrained in its play within the right lines of necessity,\nand sideways in its motions directed by free will, though thus prescribed to by\nboth, chance by turns rules either, and has the last featuring blow at events.\n\nThus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound so strange, long\ndrawn, and musically wild and unearthly, that the ball of free will dropped from\nmy hand, and I stood gazing up at the clouds whence that voice dropped like a\nwing. High aloft in the cross-trees was that mad Gay-Header, Tashtego. His body\nwas reaching eagerly forward, his hand stretched out like a wand, and at brief\nsudden intervals he continued his cries. To be sure the same sound was that very\nmoment perhaps being heard all over the seas, from hundreds of whalemen’s\nlook-outs perched as high in the air; but from few of those lungs could that\naccustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous cadence as from Tashtego the\nIndian’s.\n\nAs he stood hovering over you half suspended in air, so wildly and eagerly\npeering towards the horizon, you would have thought him some prophet or seer\nbeholding the shadows of Fate, and by those wild cries announcing their coming.\n\n“There she blows! there! there! there! she blows! she blows!”\n\n“Where-away?”\n\n“On the lee-beam, about two miles off! a school of them!”\n\nInstantly all was commotion.\n\nThe Sperm Whale blows as a clock ticks, with the same undeviating and reliable\nuniformity. And thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from other tribes of his\ngenus.\n\n“There go flukes!” was now the cry from Tashtego; and the whales disappeared.\n\n“Quick, steward!” cried Ahab. “Time! time!”\n\nDough-Boy hurried below, glanced at the watch, and reported the exact minute to\nAhab.\n\nThe ship was now kept away from the wind, and she went gently rolling before it.\nTashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading to leeward, we\nconfidently looked to see them again directly in advance of our bows. For that\nsingular craft at times evinced by the Sperm Whale when, sounding with his head\nin one direction, he nevertheless, while concealed beneath the surface, mills\nround, and swiftly swims off in the opposite quarter—this deceitfulness of his\ncould not now be in action; for there was no reason to suppose that the fish\nseen by Tashtego had been in any way alarmed, or indeed knew at all of our\nvicinity. One of the men selected for shipkeepers—that is, those not appointed\nto the boats, by this time relieved the Indian at the main-mast head. The\nsailors at the fore and mizzen had come down; the line tubs were fixed in their\nplaces; the cranes were thrust out; the mainyard was backed, and the three boats\nswung over the sea like three samphire baskets over high cliffs. Outside of the\nbulwarks their eager crews with one hand clung to the rail, while one foot was\nexpectantly poised on the gunwale. So look the long line of man-of-war’s men\nabout to throw themselves on board an enemy’s ship.\n\nBut at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took every eye\nfrom the whale. With a start all glared at dark Ahab, who was surrounded by five\ndusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 48. THE FIRST LOWERING.\n\nThe phantoms, for so they then seemed, were flitting on the other side of the\ndeck, and, with a noiseless celerity, were casting loose the tackles and bands\nof the boat which swung there. This boat had always been deemed one of the spare\nboats, though technically called the captain’s, on account of its hanging from\nthe starboard quarter. The figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart,\nwith one white tooth evilly protruding from its steel-like lips. A rumpled\nChinese jacket of black cotton funereally invested him, with wide black trowsers\nof the same dark stuff. But strangely crowning this ebonness was a glistening\nwhite plaited turban, the living hair braided and coiled round and round upon\nhis head. Less swart in aspect, the companions of this figure were of that\nvivid, tiger-yellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the\nManillas;—a race notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty, and by some\nhonest white mariners supposed to be the paid spies and secret confidential\nagents on the water of the devil, their lord, whose counting-room they suppose\nto be elsewhere.\n\nWhile yet the wondering ship’s company were gazing upon these strangers, Ahab\ncried out to the white-turbaned old man at their head, “All ready there,\nFedallah?”\n\n“Ready,” was the half-hissed reply.\n\n“Lower away then; d’ye hear?” shouting across the deck. “Lower away there, I\nsay.”\n\nSuch was the thunder of his voice, that spite of their amazement the men sprang\nover the rail; the sheaves whirled round in the blocks; with a wallow, the three\nboats dropped into the sea; while, with a dexterous, off-handed daring, unknown\nin any other vocation, the sailors, goat-like, leaped down the rolling ship’s\nside into the tossed boats below.\n\nHardly had they pulled out from under the ship’s lee, when a fourth keel, coming\nfrom the windward side, pulled round under the stern, and showed the five\nstrangers rowing Ahab, who, standing erect in the stern, loudly hailed Starbuck,\nStubb, and Flask, to spread themselves widely, so as to cover a large expanse of\nwater. But with all their eyes again riveted upon the swart Fedallah and his\ncrew, the inmates of the other boats obeyed not the command.\n\n“Captain Ahab?—” said Starbuck.\n\n“Spread yourselves,” cried Ahab; “give way, all four boats. Thou, Flask, pull\nout more to leeward!”\n\n“Aye, aye, sir,” cheerily cried little King-Post, sweeping round his great\nsteering oar. “Lay back!” addressing his crew. “There!—there!—there again! There\nshe blows right ahead, boys!—lay back!”\n\n“Never heed yonder yellow boys, Archy.”\n\n“Oh, I don’t mind ’em, sir,” said Archy; “I knew it all before now. Didn’t I\nhear ’em in the hold? And didn’t I tell Cabaco here of it? What say ye, Cabaco?\nThey are stowaways, Mr. Flask.”\n\n“Pull, pull, my fine hearts-alive; pull, my children; pull, my little ones,”\ndrawlingly and soothingly sighed Stubb to his crew, some of whom still showed\nsigns of uneasiness. “Why don’t you break your backbones, my boys? What is it\nyou stare at? Those chaps in yonder boat? Tut! They are only five more hands\ncome to help us—never mind from where—the more the merrier. Pull, then, do pull;\nnever mind the brimstone—devils are good fellows enough. So, so; there you are\nnow; that’s the stroke for a thousand pounds; that’s the stroke to sweep the\nstakes! Hurrah for the gold cup of sperm oil, my heroes! Three cheers, men—all\nhearts alive! Easy, easy; don’t be in a hurry—don’t be in a hurry. Why don’t you\nsnap your oars, you rascals? Bite something, you dogs! So, so, so, then:—softly,\nsoftly! That’s it—that’s it! long and strong. Give way there, give way! The\ndevil fetch ye, ye ragamuffin rapscallions; ye are all asleep. Stop snoring, ye\nsleepers, and pull. Pull, will ye? pull, can’t ye? pull, won’t ye? Why in the\nname of gudgeons and ginger-cakes don’t ye pull?—pull and break something! pull,\nand start your eyes out! Here!” whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle;\n“every mother’s son of ye draw his knife, and pull with the blade between his\nteeth. That’s it—that’s it. Now ye do something; that looks like it, my\nsteel-bits. Start her—start her, my silver-spoons! Start her, marling-spikes!”\n\nStubb’s exordium to his crew is given here at large, because he had rather a\npeculiar way of talking to them in general, and especially in inculcating the\nreligion of rowing. But you must not suppose from this specimen of his\nsermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions with his congregation.\nNot at all; and therein consisted his chief peculiarity. He would say the most\nterrific things to his crew, in a tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury,\nand the fury seemed so calculated merely as a spice to the fun, that no oarsman\ncould hear such queer invocations without pulling for dear life, and yet pulling\nfor the mere joke of the thing. Besides he all the time looked so easy and\nindolent himself, so loungingly managed his steering-oar, and so broadly\ngaped—open-mouthed at times—that the mere sight of such a yawning commander, by\nsheer force of contrast, acted like a charm upon the crew. Then again, Stubb was\none of those odd sort of humorists, whose jollity is sometimes so curiously\nambiguous, as to put all inferiors on their guard in the matter of obeying them.\n\nIn obedience to a sign from Ahab, Starbuck was now pulling obliquely across\nStubb’s bow; and when for a minute or so the two boats were pretty near to each\nother, Stubb hailed the mate.\n\n“Mr. Starbuck! larboard boat there, ahoy! a word with ye, sir, if ye please!”\n\n“Halloa!” returned Starbuck, turning round not a single inch as he spoke; still\nearnestly but whisperingly urging his crew; his face set like a flint from\nStubb’s.\n\n“What think ye of those yellow boys, sir!”\n\n“Smuggled on board, somehow, before the ship sailed. (Strong, strong, boys!)” in\na whisper to his crew, then speaking out loud again: “A sad business, Mr. Stubb!\n(seethe her, seethe her, my lads!) but never mind, Mr. Stubb, all for the best.\nLet all your crew pull strong, come what will. (Spring, my men, spring!) There’s\nhogsheads of sperm ahead, Mr. Stubb, and that’s what ye came for. (Pull, my\nboys!) Sperm, sperm’s the play! This at least is duty; duty and profit hand in\nhand.”\n\n“Aye, aye, I thought as much,” soliloquized Stubb, when the boats diverged, “as\nsoon as I clapt eye on ’em, I thought so. Aye, and that’s what he went into the\nafter hold for, so often, as Dough-Boy long suspected. They were hidden down\nthere. The White Whale’s at the bottom of it. Well, well, so be it! Can’t be\nhelped! All right! Give way, men! It ain’t the White Whale to-day! Give way!”\n\nNow the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant as the\nlowering of the boats from the deck, this had not unreasonably awakened a sort\nof superstitious amazement in some of the ship’s company; but Archy’s fancied\ndiscovery having some time previous got abroad among them, though indeed not\ncredited then, this had in some small measure prepared them for the event. It\ntook off the extreme edge of their wonder; and so what with all this and Stubb’s\nconfident way of accounting for their appearance, they were for the time freed\nfrom superstitious surmisings; though the affair still left abundant room for\nall manner of wild conjectures as to dark Ahab’s precise agency in the matter\nfrom the beginning. For me, I silently recalled the mysterious shadows I had\nseen creeping on board the Pequod during the dim Nantucket dawn, as well as the\nenigmatical hintings of the unaccountable Elijah.\n\nMeantime, Ahab, out of hearing of his officers, having sided the furthest to\nwindward, was still ranging ahead of the other boats; a circumstance bespeaking\nhow potent a crew was pulling him. Those tiger yellow creatures of his seemed\nall steel and whalebone; like five trip-hammers they rose and fell with regular\nstrokes of strength, which periodically started the boat along the water like a\nhorizontal burst boiler out of a Mississippi steamer. As for Fedallah, who was\nseen pulling the harpooneer oar, he had thrown aside his black jacket, and\ndisplayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the gunwale,\nclearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery horizon; while at\nthe other end of the boat Ahab, with one arm, like a fencer’s, thrown half\nbackward into the air, as if to counterbalance any tendency to trip; Ahab was\nseen steadily managing his steering oar as in a thousand boat lowerings ere the\nWhite Whale had torn him. All at once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar\nmotion and then remained fixed, while the boat’s five oars were seen\nsimultaneously peaked. Boat and crew sat motionless on the sea. Instantly the\nthree spread boats in the rear paused on their way. The whales had irregularly\nsettled bodily down into the blue, thus giving no distantly discernible token of\nthe movement, though from his closer vicinity Ahab had observed it.\n\n“Every man look out along his oars!” cried Starbuck. “Thou, Queequeg, stand up!”\n\nNimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow, the savage stood\nerect there, and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the spot where the\nchase had last been descried. Likewise upon the extreme stern of the boat where\nit was also triangularly platformed level with the gunwale, Starbuck himself was\nseen coolly and adroitly balancing himself to the jerking tossings of his chip\nof a craft, and silently eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea.\n\nNot very far distant Flask’s boat was also lying breathlessly still; its\ncommander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead, a stout sort of\npost rooted in the keel, and rising some two feet above the level of the stern\nplatform. It is used for catching turns with the whale line. Its top is not more\nspacious than the palm of a man’s hand, and standing upon such a base as that,\nFlask seemed perched at the mast-head of some ship which had sunk to all but her\ntrucks. But little King-Post was small and short, and at the same time little\nKing-Post was full of a large and tall ambition, so that this loggerhead\nstand-point of his did by no means satisfy King-Post.\n\n“I can’t see three seas off; tip us up an oar there, and let me on to that.”\n\nUpon this, Daggoo, with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way, swiftly\nslid aft, and then erecting himself volunteered his lofty shoulders for a\npedestal.\n\n“Good a mast-head as any, sir. Will you mount?”\n\n“That I will, and thank ye very much, my fine fellow; only I wish you fifty feet\ntaller.”\n\nWhereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the boat, the\ngigantic negro, stooping a little, presented his flat palm to Flask’s foot, and\nthen putting Flask’s hand on his hearse-plumed head and bidding him spring as he\nhimself should toss, with one dexterous fling landed the little man high and dry\non his shoulders. And here was Flask now standing, Daggoo with one lifted arm\nfurnishing him with a breastband to lean against and steady himself by.\n\nAt any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous habitude\nof unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect posture in his boat,\neven when pitched about by the most riotously perverse and cross-running seas.\nStill more strange to see him giddily perched upon the loggerhead itself, under\nsuch circumstances. But the sight of little Flask mounted upon gigantic Daggoo\nwas yet more curious; for sustaining himself with a cool, indifferent, easy,\nunthought of, barbaric majesty, the noble negro to every roll of the sea\nharmoniously rolled his fine form. On his broad back, flaxen-haired Flask seemed\na snow-flake. The bearer looked nobler than the rider. Though truly vivacious,\ntumultuous, ostentatious little Flask would now and then stamp with impatience;\nbut not one added heave did he thereby give to the negro’s lordly chest. So have\nI seen Passion and Vanity stamping the living magnanimous earth, but the earth\ndid not alter her tides and her seasons for that.\n\nMeanwhile Stubb, the third mate, betrayed no such far-gazing solicitudes. The\nwhales might have made one of their regular soundings, not a temporary dive from\nmere fright; and if that were the case, Stubb, as his wont in such cases, it\nseems, was resolved to solace the languishing interval with his pipe. He\nwithdrew it from his hatband, where he always wore it aslant like a feather. He\nloaded it, and rammed home the loading with his thumb-end; but hardly had he\nignited his match across the rough sandpaper of his hand, when Tashtego, his\nharpooneer, whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed stars,\nsuddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat, crying out in a\nquick phrensy of hurry, “Down, down all, and give way!—there they are!”\n\nTo a landsman, no whale, nor any sign of a herring, would have been visible at\nthat moment; nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white water, and thin\nscattered puffs of vapor hovering over it, and suffusingly blowing off to\nleeward, like the confused scud from white rolling billows. The air around\nsuddenly vibrated and tingled, as it were, like the air over intensely heated\nplates of iron. Beneath this atmospheric waving and curling, and partially\nbeneath a thin layer of water, also, the whales were swimming. Seen in advance\nof all the other indications, the puffs of vapor they spouted, seemed their\nforerunning couriers and detached flying outriders.\n\nAll four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled water and\nair. But it bade fair to outstrip them; it flew on and on, as a mass of\ninterblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the hills.\n\n“Pull, pull, my good boys,” said Starbuck, in the lowest possible but intensest\nconcentrated whisper to his men; while the sharp fixed glance from his eyes\ndarted straight ahead of the bow, almost seemed as two visible needles in two\nunerring binnacle compasses. He did not say much to his crew, though, nor did\nhis crew say anything to him. Only the silence of the boat was at intervals\nstartlingly pierced by one of his peculiar whispers, now harsh with command, now\nsoft with entreaty.\n\nHow different the loud little King-Post. “Sing out and say something, my\nhearties. Roar and pull, my thunderbolts! Beach me, beach me on their black\nbacks, boys; only do that for me, and I’ll sign over to you my Martha’s Vineyard\nplantation, boys; including wife and children, boys. Lay me on—lay me on! O\nLord, Lord! but I shall go stark, staring mad! See! see that white water!” And\nso shouting, he pulled his hat from his head, and stamped up and down on it;\nthen picking it up, flirted it far off upon the sea; and finally fell to rearing\nand plunging in the boat’s stern like a crazed colt from the prairie.\n\n“Look at that chap now,” philosophically drawled Stubb, who, with his unlighted\nshort pipe, mechanically retained between his teeth, at a short distance,\nfollowed after—“He’s got fits, that Flask has. Fits? yes, give him fits—that’s\nthe very word—pitch fits into ’em. Merrily, merrily, hearts-alive. Pudding for\nsupper, you know;—merry’s the word. Pull, babes—pull, sucklings—pull, all. But\nwhat the devil are you hurrying about? Softly, softly, and steadily, my men.\nOnly pull, and keep pulling; nothing more. Crack all your backbones, and bite\nyour knives in two—that’s all. Take it easy—why don’t ye take it easy, I say,\nand burst all your livers and lungs!”\n\nBut what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tiger-yellow crew of\nhis—these were words best omitted here; for you live under the blessed light of\nthe evangelical land. Only the infidel sharks in the audacious seas may give ear\nto such words, when, with tornado brow, and eyes of red murder, and foam-glued\nlips, Ahab leaped after his prey.\n\nMeanwhile, all the boats tore on. The repeated specific allusions of Flask to\n“that whale,” as he called the fictitious monster which he declared to be\nincessantly tantalizing his boat’s bow with its tail—these allusions of his were\nat times so vivid and life-like, that they would cause some one or two of his\nmen to snatch a fearful look over the shoulder. But this was against all rule;\nfor the oarsmen must put out their eyes, and ram a skewer through their necks;\nusage pronouncing that they must have no organs but ears, and no limbs but arms,\nin these critical moments.\n\nIt was a sight full of quick wonder and awe! The vast swells of the omnipotent\nsea; the surging, hollow roar they made, as they rolled along the eight\ngunwales, like gigantic bowls in a boundless bowling-green; the brief suspended\nagony of the boat, as it would tip for an instant on the knife-like edge of the\nsharper waves, that almost seemed threatening to cut it in two; the sudden\nprofound dip into the watery glens and hollows; the keen spurrings and goadings\nto gain the top of the opposite hill; the headlong, sled-like slide down its\nother side;—all these, with the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers, and the\nshuddering gasps of the oarsmen, with the wondrous sight of the ivory Pequod\nbearing down upon her boats with outstretched sails, like a wild hen after her\nscreaming brood;—all this was thrilling.\n\nNot the raw recruit, marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever heat of\nhis first battle; not the dead man’s ghost encountering the first unknown\nphantom in the other world;—neither of these can feel stranger and stronger\nemotions than that man does, who for the first time finds himself pulling into\nthe charmed, churned circle of the hunted sperm whale.\n\nThe dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and more\nvisible, owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloud-shadows flung upon\nthe sea. The jets of vapor no longer blended, but tilted everywhere to right and\nleft; the whales seemed separating their wakes. The boats were pulled more\napart; Starbuck giving chase to three whales running dead to leeward. Our sail\nwas now set, and, with the still rising wind, we rushed along; the boat going\nwith such madness through the water, that the lee oars could scarcely be worked\nrapidly enough to escape being torn from the row-locks.\n\nSoon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist; neither ship nor\nboat to be seen.\n\n“Give way, men,” whispered Starbuck, drawing still further aft the sheet of his\nsail; “there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall comes. There’s white\nwater again!—close to! Spring!”\n\nSoon after, two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted that the\nother boats had got fast; but hardly were they overheard, when with a\nlightning-like hurtling whisper Starbuck said: “Stand up!” and Queequeg, harpoon\nin hand, sprang to his feet.\n\nThough not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death peril so close\nto them ahead, yet with their eyes on the intense countenance of the mate in the\nstern of the boat, they knew that the imminent instant had come; they heard,\ntoo, an enormous wallowing sound as of fifty elephants stirring in their litter.\nMeanwhile the boat was still booming through the mist, the waves curling and\nhissing around us like the erected crests of enraged serpents.\n\n“That’s his hump. There, there, give it to him!” whispered Starbuck.\n\nA short rushing sound leaped out of the boat; it was the darted iron of\nQueequeg. Then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from astern,\nwhile forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge; the sail collapsed and\nexploded; a gush of scalding vapor shot up near by; something rolled and tumbled\nlike an earthquake beneath us. The whole crew were half suffocated as they were\ntossed helter-skelter into the white curdling cream of the squall. Squall,\nwhale, and harpoon had all blended together; and the whale, merely grazed by the\niron, escaped.\n\nThough completely swamped, the boat was nearly unharmed. Swimming round it we\npicked up the floating oars, and lashing them across the gunwale, tumbled back\nto our places. There we sat up to our knees in the sea, the water covering every\nrib and plank, so that to our downward gazing eyes the suspended craft seemed a\ncoral boat grown up to us from the bottom of the ocean.\n\nThe wind increased to a howl; the waves dashed their bucklers together; the\nwhole squall roared, forked, and crackled around us like a white fire upon the\nprairie, in which, unconsumed, we were burning; immortal in these jaws of death!\nIn vain we hailed the other boats; as well roar to the live coals down the\nchimney of a flaming furnace as hail those boats in that storm. Meanwhile the\ndriving scud, rack, and mist, grew darker with the shadows of night; no sign of\nthe ship could be seen. The rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out the\nboat. The oars were useless as propellers, performing now the office of\nlife-preservers. So, cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg, after many\nfailures Starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern; then stretching\nit on a waif pole, handed it to Queequeg as the standard-bearer of this forlorn\nhope. There, then, he sat, holding up that imbecile candle in the heart of that\nalmighty forlornness. There, then, he sat, the sign and symbol of a man without\nfaith, hopelessly holding up hope in the midst of despair.\n\nWet, drenched through, and shivering cold, despairing of ship or boat, we lifted\nup our eyes as the dawn came on. The mist still spread over the sea, the empty\nlantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat. Suddenly Queequeg started to his\nfeet, hollowing his hand to his ear. We all heard a faint creaking, as of ropes\nand yards hitherto muffled by the storm. The sound came nearer and nearer; the\nthick mists were dimly parted by a huge, vague form. Affrighted, we all sprang\ninto the sea as the ship at last loomed into view, bearing right down upon us\nwithin a distance of not much more than its length.\n\nFloating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat, as for one instant it tossed\nand gaped beneath the ship’s bows like a chip at the base of a cataract; and\nthen the vast hull rolled over it, and it was seen no more till it came up\nweltering astern. Again we swam for it, were dashed against it by the seas, and\nwere at last taken up and safely landed on board. Ere the squall came close to,\nthe other boats had cut loose from their fish and returned to the ship in good\ntime. The ship had given us up, but was still cruising, if haply it might light\nupon some token of our perishing,—an oar or a lance pole.\n\n"},{"title":"Test Section Title","content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 62. THE DART.\n\nA word concerning an incident in the last chapter.\n\nAccording to the invariable usage of the fishery, the whale-boat pushes off from\nthe ship, with the headsman or whale-killer as temporary steersman, and the\nharpooneer or whale-fastener pulling the foremost oar, the one known as the\nharpooneer-oar. Now it needs a strong, nervous arm to strike the first iron into\nthe fish; for often, in what is called a long dart, the heavy implement has to\nbe flung to the distance of twenty or thirty feet. But however prolonged and\nexhausting the chase, the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to\nthe uttermost; indeed, he is expected to set an example of superhuman activity\nto the rest, not only by incredible rowing, but by repeated loud and intrepid\nexclamations; and what it is to keep shouting at the top of one’s compass, while\nall the other muscles are strained and half started—what that is none know but\nthose who have tried it. For one, I cannot bawl very heartily and work very\nrecklessly at one and the same time. In this straining, bawling state, then,\nwith his back to the fish, all at once the exhausted harpooneer hears the\nexciting cry—“Stand up, and give it to him!” He now has to drop and secure his\noar, turn round on his centre half way, seize his harpoon from the crotch, and\nwith what little strength may remain, he essays to pitch it somehow into the\nwhale. No wonder, taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body, that out of\nfifty fair chances for a dart, not five are successful; no wonder that so many\nhapless harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated; no wonder that some of them\nactually burst their blood-vessels in the boat; no wonder that some sperm\nwhalemen are absent four years with four barrels; no wonder that to many ship\nowners, whaling is but a losing concern; for it is the harpooneer that makes the\nvoyage, and if you take the breath out of his body how can you expect to find it\nthere when most wanted!\n\nAgain, if the dart be successful, then at the second critical instant, that is,\nwhen the whale starts to run, the boatheader and harpooneer likewise start to\nrunning fore and aft, to the imminent jeopardy of themselves and every one else.\nIt is then they change places; and the headsman, the chief officer of the little\ncraft, takes his proper station in the bows of the boat.\n\nNow, I care not who maintains the contrary, but all this is both foolish and\nunnecessary. The headsman should stay in the bows from first to last; he should\nboth dart the harpoon and the lance, and no rowing whatever should be expected\nof him, except under circumstances obvious to any fisherman. I know that this\nwould sometimes involve a slight loss of speed in the chase; but long experience\nin various whalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in the vast\nmajority of failures in the fishery, it has not by any means been so much the\nspeed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of the harpooneer that has\ncaused them.\n\nTo insure the greatest efficiency in the dart, the harpooneers of this world\nmust start to their feet from out of idleness, and not from out of toil.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 63. THE CROTCH.\n\nOut of the trunk, the branches grow; out of them, the twigs. So, in productive\nsubjects, grow the chapters.\n\nThe crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention. It is a\nnotched stick of a peculiar form, some two feet in length, which is\nperpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the bow, for the\npurpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of the harpoon, whose\nother naked, barbed end slopingly projects from the prow. Thereby the weapon is\ninstantly at hand to its hurler, who snatches it up as readily from its rest as\na backwoodsman swings his rifle from the wall. It is customary to have two\nharpoons reposing in the crotch, respectively called the first and second irons.\n\nBut these two harpoons, each by its own cord, are both connected with the line;\nthe object being this: to dart them both, if possible, one instantly after the\nother into the same whale; so that if, in the coming drag, one should draw out,\nthe other may still retain a hold. It is a doubling of the chances. But it very\noften happens that owing to the instantaneous, violent, convulsive running of\nthe whale upon receiving the first iron, it becomes impossible for the\nharpooneer, however lightning-like in his movements, to pitch the second iron\ninto him. Nevertheless, as the second iron is already connected with the line,\nand the line is running, hence that weapon must, at all events, be\nanticipatingly tossed out of the boat, somehow and somewhere; else the most\nterrible jeopardy would involve all hands. Tumbled into the water, it\naccordingly is in such cases; the spare coils of box line (mentioned in a\npreceding chapter) making this feat, in most instances, prudently practicable.\nBut this critical act is not always unattended with the saddest and most fatal\ncasualties.\n\nFurthermore: you must know that when the second iron is thrown overboard, it\nthenceforth becomes a dangling, sharp-edged terror, skittishly curvetting about\nboth boat and whale, entangling the lines, or cutting them, and making a\nprodigious sensation in all directions. Nor, in general, is it possible to\nsecure it again until the whale is fairly captured and a corpse.\n\nConsider, now, how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging one\nunusually strong, active, and knowing whale; when owing to these qualities in\nhim, as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of such an audacious\nenterprise, eight or ten loose second irons may be simultaneously dangling about\nhim. For, of course, each boat is supplied with several harpoons to bend on to\nthe line should the first one be ineffectually darted without recovery. All\nthese particulars are faithfully narrated here, as they will not fail to\nelucidate several most important, however intricate passages, in scenes\nhereafter to be painted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 64. STUBB’S SUPPER.\n\nStubb’s whale had been killed some distance from the ship. It was a calm; so,\nforming a tandem of three boats, we commenced the slow business of towing the\ntrophy to the Pequod. And now, as we eighteen men with our thirty-six arms, and\none hundred and eighty thumbs and fingers, slowly toiled hour after hour upon\nthat inert, sluggish corpse in the sea; and it seemed hardly to budge at all,\nexcept at long intervals; good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness\nof the mass we moved. For, upon the great canal of Hang-Ho, or whatever they\ncall it, in China, four or five laborers on the foot-path will draw a bulky\nfreighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour; but this grand argosy we towed\nheavily forged along, as if laden with pig-lead in bulk.\n\nDarkness came on; but three lights up and down in the Pequod’s main-rigging\ndimly guided our way; till drawing nearer we saw Ahab dropping one of several\nmore lanterns over the bulwarks. Vacantly eyeing the heaving whale for a moment,\nhe issued the usual orders for securing it for the night, and then handing his\nlantern to a seaman, went his way into the cabin, and did not come forward again\nuntil morning.\n\nThough, in overseeing the pursuit of this whale, Captain Ahab had evinced his\ncustomary activity, to call it so; yet now that the creature was dead, some\nvague dissatisfaction, or impatience, or despair, seemed working in him; as if\nthe sight of that dead body reminded him that Moby Dick was yet to be slain; and\nthough a thousand other whales were brought to his ship, all that would not one\njot advance his grand, monomaniac object. Very soon you would have thought from\nthe sound on the Pequod’s decks, that all hands were preparing to cast anchor in\nthe deep; for heavy chains are being dragged along the deck, and thrust rattling\nout of the port-holes. But by those clanking links, the vast corpse itself, not\nthe ship, is to be moored. Tied by the head to the stern, and by the tail to the\nbows, the whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessel’s and seen\nthrough the darkness of the night, which obscured the spars and rigging aloft,\nthe two—ship and whale, seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks, whereof\none reclines while the other remains standing.*\n\n*A little item may as well be related here. The strongest and most reliable hold\nwhich the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside, is by the flukes or\ntail; and as from its greater density that part is relatively heavier than any\nother (excepting the side-fins), its flexibility even in death, causes it to\nsink low beneath the surface; so that with the hand you cannot get at it from\nthe boat, in order to put the chain round it. But this difficulty is ingeniously\novercome: a small, strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end,\nand a weight in its middle, while the other end is secured to the ship. By\nadroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side of the\nmass, so that now having girdled the whale, the chain is readily made to follow\nsuit; and being slipped along the body, is at last locked fast round the\nsmallest part of the tail, at the point of junction with its broad flukes or\nlobes.\n\nIf moody Ahab was now all quiescence, at least so far as could be known on deck,\nStubb, his second mate, flushed with conquest, betrayed an unusual but still\ngood-natured excitement. Such an unwonted bustle was he in that the staid\nStarbuck, his official superior, quietly resigned to him for the time the sole\nmanagement of affairs. One small, helping cause of all this liveliness in Stubb,\nwas soon made strangely manifest. Stubb was a high liver; he was somewhat\nintemperately fond of the whale as a flavorish thing to his palate.\n\n“A steak, a steak, ere I sleep! You, Daggoo! overboard you go, and cut me one\nfrom his small!”\n\nHere be it known, that though these wild fishermen do not, as a general thing,\nand according to the great military maxim, make the enemy defray the current\nexpenses of the war (at least before realizing the proceeds of the voyage), yet\nnow and then you find some of these Nantucketers who have a genuine relish for\nthat particular part of the Sperm Whale designated by Stubb; comprising the\ntapering extremity of the body.\n\nAbout midnight that steak was cut and cooked; and lighted by two lanterns of\nsperm oil, Stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti supper at the capstan-head,\nas if that capstan were a sideboard. Nor was Stubb the only banqueter on whale’s\nflesh that night. Mingling their mumblings with his own mastications, thousands\non thousands of sharks, swarming round the dead leviathan, smackingly feasted on\nits fatness. The few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the\nsharp slapping of their tails against the hull, within a few inches of the\nsleepers’ hearts. Peering over the side you could just see them (as before you\nheard them) wallowing in the sullen, black waters, and turning over on their\nbacks as they scooped out huge globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a\nhuman head. This particular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous. How at\nsuch an apparently unassailable surface, they contrive to gouge out such\nsymmetrical mouthfuls, remains a part of the universal problem of all things.\nThe mark they thus leave on the whale, may best be likened to the hollow made by\na carpenter in countersinking for a screw.\n\nThough amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight, sharks will be\nseen longingly gazing up to the ship’s decks, like hungry dogs round a table\nwhere red meat is being carved, ready to bolt down every killed man that is\ntossed to them; and though, while the valiant butchers over the deck-table are\nthus cannibally carving each other’s live meat with carving-knives all gilded\nand tasselled, the sharks, also, with their jewel-hilted mouths, are\nquarrelsomely carving away under the table at the dead meat; and though, were\nyou to turn the whole affair upside down, it would still be pretty much the same\nthing, that is to say, a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties; and\nthough sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships crossing the\nAtlantic, systematically trotting alongside, to be handy in case a parcel is to\nbe carried anywhere, or a dead slave to be decently buried; and though one or\ntwo other like instances might be set down, touching the set terms, places, and\noccasions, when sharks do most socially congregate, and most hilariously feast;\nyet is there no conceivable time or occasion when you will find them in such\ncountless numbers, and in gayer or more jovial spirits, than around a dead sperm\nwhale, moored by night to a whaleship at sea. If you have never seen that sight,\nthen suspend your decision about the propriety of devil-worship, and the\nexpediency of conciliating the devil.\n\nBut, as yet, Stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that was going on so\nnigh him, no more than the sharks heeded the smacking of his own epicurean lips.\n\n“Cook, cook!—where’s that old Fleece?” he cried at length, widening his legs\nstill further, as if to form a more secure base for his supper; and, at the same\ntime darting his fork into the dish, as if stabbing with his lance; “cook, you\ncook!—sail this way, cook!”\n\nThe old black, not in any very high glee at having been previously roused from\nhis warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour, came shambling along from his\ngalley, for, like many old blacks, there was something the matter with his\nknee-pans, which he did not keep well scoured like his other pans; this old\nFleece, as they called him, came shuffling and limping along, assisting his step\nwith his tongs, which, after a clumsy fashion, were made of straightened iron\nhoops; this old Ebony floundered along, and in obedience to the word of command,\ncame to a dead stop on the opposite side of Stubb’s sideboard; when, with both\nhands folded before him, and resting on his two-legged cane, he bowed his arched\nback still further over, at the same time sideways inclining his head, so as to\nbring his best ear into play.\n\n“Cook,” said Stubb, rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his mouth, “don’t\nyou think this steak is rather overdone? You’ve been beating this steak too\nmuch, cook; it’s too tender. Don’t I always say that to be good, a whale-steak\nmust be tough? There are those sharks now over the side, don’t you see they\nprefer it tough and rare? What a shindy they are kicking up! Cook, go and talk\nto ’em; tell ’em they are welcome to help themselves civilly, and in moderation,\nbut they must keep quiet. Blast me, if I can hear my own voice. Away, cook, and\ndeliver my message. Here, take this lantern,” snatching one from his sideboard;\n“now then, go and preach to ’em!”\n\nSullenly taking the offered lantern, old Fleece limped across the deck to the\nbulwarks; and then, with one hand dropping his light low over the sea, so as to\nget a good view of his congregation, with the other hand he solemnly flourished\nhis tongs, and leaning far over the side in a mumbling voice began addressing\nthe sharks, while Stubb, softly crawling behind, overheard all that was said.\n\n“Fellow-critters: I’se ordered here to say dat you must stop dat dam noise dare.\nYou hear? Stop dat dam smackin’ ob de lip! Massa Stubb say dat you can fill your\ndam bellies up to de hatchings, but by Gor! you must stop dat dam racket!”\n\n“Cook,” here interposed Stubb, accompanying the word with a sudden slap on the\nshoulder,—“Cook! why, damn your eyes, you mustn’t swear that way when you’re\npreaching. That’s no way to convert sinners, cook!”\n\n“Who dat? Den preach to him yourself,” sullenly turning to go.\n\n“No, cook; go on, go on.”\n\n“Well, den, Belubed fellow-critters:”—\n\n“Right!” exclaimed Stubb, approvingly, “coax ’em to it; try that,” and Fleece\ncontinued.\n\n“Do you is all sharks, and by natur wery woracious, yet I zay to you,\nfellow-critters, dat dat woraciousness—’top dat dam slappin’ ob de tail! How you\ntink to hear, spose you keep up such a dam slappin’ and bitin’ dare?”\n\n“Cook,” cried Stubb, collaring him, “I won’t have that swearing. Talk to ’em\ngentlemanly.”\n\nOnce more the sermon proceeded.\n\n“Your woraciousness, fellow-critters, I don’t blame ye so much for; dat is\nnatur, and can’t be helped; but to gobern dat wicked natur, dat is de pint. You\nis sharks, sartin; but if you gobern de shark in you, why den you be angel; for\nall angel is not’ing more dan de shark well goberned. Now, look here, bred’ren,\njust try wonst to be cibil, a helping yourselbs from dat whale. Don’t be tearin’\nde blubber out your neighbour’s mout, I say. Is not one shark dood right as\ntoder to dat whale? And, by Gor, none on you has de right to dat whale; dat\nwhale belong to some one else. I know some o’ you has berry brig mout, brigger\ndan oders; but den de brig mouts sometimes has de small bellies; so dat de\nbrigness of de mout is not to swaller wid, but to bit off de blubber for de\nsmall fry ob sharks, dat can’t get into de scrouge to help demselves.”\n\n“Well done, old Fleece!” cried Stubb, “that’s Christianity; go on.”\n\n“No use goin’ on; de dam willains will keep a scougin’ and slappin’ each oder,\nMassa Stubb; dey don’t hear one word; no use a-preachin’ to such dam g’uttons as\nyou call ’em, till dare bellies is full, and dare bellies is bottomless; and\nwhen dey do get ’em full, dey wont hear you den; for den dey sink in de sea, go\nfast to sleep on de coral, and can’t hear not’ing at all, no more, for eber and\neber.”\n\n“Upon my soul, I am about of the same opinion; so give the benediction, Fleece,\nand I’ll away to my supper.”\n\nUpon this, Fleece, holding both hands over the fishy mob, raised his shrill\nvoice, and cried—\n\n“Cussed fellow-critters! Kick up de damndest row as ever you can; fill your dam’\nbellies ’till dey bust—and den die.”\n\n“Now, cook,” said Stubb, resuming his supper at the capstan; “stand just where\nyou stood before, there, over against me, and pay particular attention.”\n\n“All dention,” said Fleece, again stooping over upon his tongs in the desired\nposition.\n\n“Well,” said Stubb, helping himself freely meanwhile; “I shall now go back to\nthe subject of this steak. In the first place, how old are you, cook?”\n\n“What dat do wid de ’teak,” said the old black, testily.\n\n“Silence! How old are you, cook?”\n\n“’Bout ninety, dey say,” he gloomily muttered.\n\n“And you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years, cook, and don’t\nknow yet how to cook a whale-steak?” rapidly bolting another mouthful at the\nlast word, so that morsel seemed a continuation of the question. “Where were you\nborn, cook?”\n\n“’Hind de hatchway, in ferry-boat, goin’ ober de Roanoke.”\n\n“Born in a ferry-boat! That’s queer, too. But I want to know what country you\nwere born in, cook!”\n\n“Didn’t I say de Roanoke country?” he cried sharply.\n\n“No, you didn’t, cook; but I’ll tell you what I’m coming to, cook. You must go\nhome and be born over again; you don’t know how to cook a whale-steak yet.”\n\n“Bress my soul, if I cook noder one,” he growled, angrily, turning round to\ndepart.\n\n“Come back, cook;—here, hand me those tongs;—now take that bit of steak there,\nand tell me if you think that steak cooked as it should be? Take it, I\nsay”—holding the tongs towards him—“take it, and taste it.”\n\nFaintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment, the old negro muttered,\n“Best cooked ’teak I eber taste; joosy, berry joosy.”\n\n“Cook,” said Stubb, squaring himself once more; “do you belong to the church?”\n\n“Passed one once in Cape-Down,” said the old man sullenly.\n\n“And you have once in your life passed a holy church in Cape-Town, where you\ndoubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his hearers as his beloved\nfellow-creatures, have you, cook! And yet you come here, and tell me such a\ndreadful lie as you did just now, eh?” said Stubb. “Where do you expect to go\nto, cook?”\n\n“Go to bed berry soon,” he mumbled, half-turning as he spoke.\n\n“Avast! heave to! I mean when you die, cook. It’s an awful question. Now what’s\nyour answer?”\n\n“When dis old brack man dies,” said the negro slowly, changing his whole air and\ndemeanor, “he hisself won’t go nowhere; but some bressed angel will come and\nfetch him.”\n\n“Fetch him? How? In a coach and four, as they fetched Elijah? And fetch him\nwhere?”\n\n“Up dere,” said Fleece, holding his tongs straight over his head, and keeping it\nthere very solemnly.\n\n“So, then, you expect to go up into our main-top, do you, cook, when you are\ndead? But don’t you know the higher you climb, the colder it gets? Main-top,\neh?”\n\n“Didn’t say dat t’all,” said Fleece, again in the sulks.\n\n“You said up there, didn’t you? and now look yourself, and see where your tongs\nare pointing. But, perhaps you expect to get into heaven by crawling through the\nlubber’s hole, cook; but, no, no, cook, you don’t get there, except you go the\nregular way, round by the rigging. It’s a ticklish business, but must be done,\nor else it’s no go. But none of us are in heaven yet. Drop your tongs, cook, and\nhear my orders. Do ye hear? Hold your hat in one hand, and clap t’other a’top of\nyour heart, when I’m giving my orders, cook. What! that your heart,\nthere?—that’s your gizzard! Aloft! aloft!—that’s it—now you have it. Hold it\nthere now, and pay attention.”\n\n“All ’dention,” said the old black, with both hands placed as desired, vainly\nwriggling his grizzled head, as if to get both ears in front at one and the same\ntime.\n\n“Well then, cook, you see this whale-steak of yours was so very bad, that I have\nput it out of sight as soon as possible; you see that, don’t you? Well, for the\nfuture, when you cook another whale-steak for my private table here, the\ncapstan, I’ll tell you what to do so as not to spoil it by overdoing. Hold the\nsteak in one hand, and show a live coal to it with the other; that done, dish\nit; d’ye hear? And now to-morrow, cook, when we are cutting in the fish, be sure\nyou stand by to get the tips of his fins; have them put in pickle. As for the\nends of the flukes, have them soused, cook. There, now ye may go.”\n\nBut Fleece had hardly got three paces off, when he was recalled.\n\n“Cook, give me cutlets for supper to-morrow night in the mid-watch. D’ye hear?\naway you sail, then.—Halloa! stop! make a bow before you go.—Avast heaving\nagain! Whale-balls for breakfast—don’t forget.”\n\n“Wish, by gor! whale eat him, ’stead of him eat whale. I’m bressed if he ain’t\nmore of shark dan Massa Shark hisself,” muttered the old man, limping away; with\nwhich sage ejaculation he went to his hammock.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 65. THE WHALE AS A DISH.\n\nThat mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp, and, like\nStubb, eat him by his own light, as you may say; this seems so outlandish a\nthing that one must needs go a little into the history and philosophy of it.\n\nIt is upon record, that three centuries ago the tongue of the Right Whale was\nesteemed a great delicacy in France, and commanded large prices there. Also,\nthat in Henry VIIIth’s time, a certain cook of the court obtained a handsome\nreward for inventing an admirable sauce to be eaten with barbacued porpoises,\nwhich, you remember, are a species of whale. Porpoises, indeed, are to this day\nconsidered fine eating. The meat is made into balls about the size of billiard\nballs, and being well seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtle-balls or\nveal balls. The old monks of Dunfermline were very fond of them. They had a\ngreat porpoise grant from the crown.\n\nThe fact is, that among his hunters at least, the whale would by all hands be\nconsidered a noble dish, were there not so much of him; but when you come to sit\ndown before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet long, it takes away your\nappetite. Only the most unprejudiced of men like Stubb, nowadays partake of\ncooked whales; but the Esquimaux are not so fastidious. We all know how they\nlive upon whales, and have rare old vintages of prime old train oil. Zogranda,\none of their most famous doctors, recommends strips of blubber for infants, as\nbeing exceedingly juicy and nourishing. And this reminds me that certain\nEnglishmen, who long ago were accidentally left in Greenland by a whaling\nvessel—that these men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of\nwhales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber. Among the Dutch\nwhalemen these scraps are called “fritters”; which, indeed, they greatly\nresemble, being brown and crisp, and smelling something like old Amsterdam\nhousewives’ dough-nuts or oly-cooks, when fresh. They have such an eatable look\nthat the most self-denying stranger can hardly keep his hands off.\n\nBut what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish, is his exceeding\nrichness. He is the great prize ox of the sea, too fat to be delicately good.\nLook at his hump, which would be as fine eating as the buffalo’s (which is\nesteemed a rare dish), were it not such a solid pyramid of fat. But the\nspermaceti itself, how bland and creamy that is; like the transparent,\nhalf-jellied, white meat of a cocoanut in the third month of its growth, yet far\ntoo rich to supply a substitute for butter. Nevertheless, many whalemen have a\nmethod of absorbing it into some other substance, and then partaking of it. In\nthe long try watches of the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip\ntheir ship-biscuit into the huge oil-pots and let them fry there awhile. Many a\ngood supper have I thus made.\n\nIn the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a fine dish. The\ncasket of the skull is broken into with an axe, and the two plump, whitish lobes\nbeing withdrawn (precisely resembling two large puddings), they are then mixed\nwith flour, and cooked into a most delectable mess, in flavor somewhat\nresembling calves’ head, which is quite a dish among some epicures; and every\none knows that some young bucks among the epicures, by continually dining upon\ncalves’ brains, by and by get to have a little brains of their own, so as to be\nable to tell a calf’s head from their own heads; which, indeed, requires\nuncommon discrimination. And that is the reason why a young buck with an\nintelligent looking calf’s head before him, is somehow one of the saddest sights\nyou can see. The head looks a sort of reproachfully at him, with an “Et tu\nBrute!” expression.\n\nIt is not, perhaps, entirely because the whale is so excessively unctuous that\nlandsmen seem to regard the eating of him with abhorrence; that appears to\nresult, in some way, from the consideration before mentioned: i.e. that a man\nshould eat a newly murdered thing of the sea, and eat it too by its own light.\nBut no doubt the first man that ever murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer;\nperhaps he was hung; and if he had been put on his trial by oxen, he certainly\nwould have been; and he certainly deserved it if any murderer does. Go to the\nmeat-market of a Saturday night and see the crowds of live bipeds staring up at\nthe long rows of dead quadrupeds. Does not that sight take a tooth out of the\ncannibal’s jaw? Cannibals? who is not a cannibal? I tell you it will be more\ntolerable for the Fejee that salted down a lean missionary in his cellar against\na coming famine; it will be more tolerable for that provident Fejee, I say, in\nthe day of judgment, than for thee, civilized and enlightened gourmand, who\nnailest geese to the ground and feastest on their bloated livers in thy\npaté-de-foie-gras.\n\nBut Stubb, he eats the whale by its own light, does he? and that is adding\ninsult to injury, is it? Look at your knife-handle, there, my civilized and\nenlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef, what is that handle made\nof?—what but the bones of the brother of the very ox you are eating? And what do\nyou pick your teeth with, after devouring that fat goose? With a feather of the\nsame fowl. And with what quill did the Secretary of the Society for the\nSuppression of Cruelty to Ganders formally indite his circulars? It is only\nwithin the last month or two that that society passed a resolution to patronize\nnothing but steel pens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 66. THE SHARK MASSACRE.\n\nWhen in the Southern Fishery, a captured Sperm Whale, after long and weary toil,\nis brought alongside late at night, it is not, as a general thing at least,\ncustomary to proceed at once to the business of cutting him in. For that\nbusiness is an exceedingly laborious one; is not very soon completed; and\nrequires all hands to set about it. Therefore, the common usage is to take in\nall sail; lash the helm a’lee; and then send every one below to his hammock till\ndaylight, with the reservation that, until that time, anchor-watches shall be\nkept; that is, two and two for an hour, each couple, the crew in rotation shall\nmount the deck to see that all goes well.\n\nBut sometimes, especially upon the Line in the Pacific, this plan will not\nanswer at all; because such incalculable hosts of sharks gather round the moored\ncarcase, that were he left so for six hours, say, on a stretch, little more than\nthe skeleton would be visible by morning. In most other parts of the ocean,\nhowever, where these fish do not so largely abound, their wondrous voracity can\nbe at times considerably diminished, by vigorously stirring them up with sharp\nwhaling-spades, a procedure notwithstanding, which, in some instances, only\nseems to tickle them into still greater activity. But it was not thus in the\npresent case with the Pequod’s sharks; though, to be sure, any man unaccustomed\nto such sights, to have looked over her side that night, would have almost\nthought the whole round sea was one huge cheese, and those sharks the maggots in\nit.\n\nNevertheless, upon Stubb setting the anchor-watch after his supper was\nconcluded; and when, accordingly, Queequeg and a forecastle seaman came on deck,\nno small excitement was created among the sharks; for immediately suspending the\ncutting stages over the side, and lowering three lanterns, so that they cast\nlong gleams of light over the turbid sea, these two mariners, darting their long\nwhaling-spades, kept up an incessant murdering of the sharks,* by striking the\nkeen steel deep into their skulls, seemingly their only vital part. But in the\nfoamy confusion of their mixed and struggling hosts, the marksmen could not\nalways hit their mark; and this brought about new revelations of the incredible\nferocity of the foe. They viciously snapped, not only at each other’s\ndisembowelments, but like flexible bows, bent round, and bit their own; till\nthose entrails seemed swallowed over and over again by the same mouth, to be\noppositely voided by the gaping wound. Nor was this all. It was unsafe to meddle\nwith the corpses and ghosts of these creatures. A sort of generic or Pantheistic\nvitality seemed to lurk in their very joints and bones, after what might be\ncalled the individual life had departed. Killed and hoisted on deck for the sake\nof his skin, one of these sharks almost took poor Queequeg’s hand off, when he\ntried to shut down the dead lid of his murderous jaw.\n\n*The whaling-spade used for cutting-in is made of the very best steel; is about\nthe bigness of a man’s spread hand; and in general shape, corresponds to the\ngarden implement after which it is named; only its sides are perfectly flat, and\nits upper end considerably narrower than the lower. This weapon is always kept\nas sharp as possible; and when being used is occasionally honed, just like a\nrazor. In its socket, a stiff pole, from twenty to thirty feet long, is inserted\nfor a handle.\n\n“Queequeg no care what god made him shark,” said the savage, agonizingly lifting\nhis hand up and down; “wedder Fejee god or Nantucket god; but de god wat made\nshark must be one dam Ingin.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 67. CUTTING IN.\n\nIt was a Saturday night, and such a Sabbath as followed! Ex officio professors\nof Sabbath breaking are all whalemen. The ivory Pequod was turned into what\nseemed a shamble; every sailor a butcher. You would have thought we were\noffering up ten thousand red oxen to the sea gods.\n\nIn the first place, the enormous cutting tackles, among other ponderous things\ncomprising a cluster of blocks generally painted green, and which no single man\ncan possibly lift—this vast bunch of grapes was swayed up to the main-top and\nfirmly lashed to the lower mast-head, the strongest point anywhere above a\nship’s deck. The end of the hawser-like rope winding through these intricacies,\nwas then conducted to the windlass, and the huge lower block of the tackles was\nswung over the whale; to this block the great blubber hook, weighing some one\nhundred pounds, was attached. And now suspended in stages over the side,\nStarbuck and Stubb, the mates, armed with their long spades, began cutting a\nhole in the body for the insertion of the hook just above the nearest of the two\nside-fins. This done, a broad, semicircular line is cut round the hole, the hook\nis inserted, and the main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus, now\ncommence heaving in one dense crowd at the windlass. When instantly, the entire\nship careens over on her side; every bolt in her starts like the nail-heads of\nan old house in frosty weather; she trembles, quivers, and nods her frighted\nmast-heads to the sky. More and more she leans over to the whale, while every\ngasping heave of the windlass is answered by a helping heave from the billows;\ntill at last, a swift, startling snap is heard; with a great swash the ship\nrolls upwards and backwards from the whale, and the triumphant tackle rises into\nsight dragging after it the disengaged semicircular end of the first strip of\nblubber. Now as the blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an\norange, so is it stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimes\nstripped by spiralizing it. For the strain constantly kept up by the windlass\ncontinually keeps the whale rolling over and over in the water, and as the\nblubber in one strip uniformly peels off along the line called the “scarf,”\nsimultaneously cut by the spades of Starbuck and Stubb, the mates; and just as\nfast as it is thus peeled off, and indeed by that very act itself, it is all the\ntime being hoisted higher and higher aloft till its upper end grazes the\nmain-top; the men at the windlass then cease heaving, and for a moment or two\nthe prodigious blood-dripping mass sways to and fro as if let down from the sky,\nand every one present must take good heed to dodge it when it swings, else it\nmay box his ears and pitch him headlong overboard.\n\nOne of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long, keen weapon called a\nboarding-sword, and watching his chance he dexterously slices out a considerable\nhole in the lower part of the swaying mass. Into this hole, the end of the\nsecond alternating great tackle is then hooked so as to retain a hold upon the\nblubber, in order to prepare for what follows. Whereupon, this accomplished\nswordsman, warning all hands to stand off, once more makes a scientific dash at\nthe mass, and with a few sidelong, desperate, lunging slicings, severs it\ncompletely in twain; so that while the short lower part is still fast, the long\nupper strip, called a blanket-piece, swings clear, and is all ready for\nlowering. The heavers forward now resume their song, and while the one tackle is\npeeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale, the other is slowly\nslackened away, and down goes the first strip through the main hatchway right\nbeneath, into an unfurnished parlor called the blubber-room. Into this twilight\napartment sundry nimble hands keep coiling away the long blanket-piece as if it\nwere a great live mass of plaited serpents. And thus the work proceeds; the two\ntackles hoisting and lowering simultaneously; both whale and windlass heaving,\nthe heavers singing, the blubber-room gentlemen coiling, the mates scarfing, the\nship straining, and all hands swearing occasionally, by way of assuaging the\ngeneral friction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 68. THE BLANKET.\n\nI have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject, the skin of the\nwhale. I have had controversies about it with experienced whalemen afloat, and\nlearned naturalists ashore. My original opinion remains unchanged; but it is\nonly an opinion.\n\nThe question is, what and where is the skin of the whale? Already you know what\nhis blubber is. That blubber is something of the consistence of firm,\nclose-grained beef, but tougher, more elastic and compact, and ranges from eight\nor ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness.\n\nNow, however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any creature’s skin as\nbeing of that sort of consistence and thickness, yet in point of fact these are\nno arguments against such a presumption; because you cannot raise any other\ndense enveloping layer from the whale’s body but that same blubber; and the\noutermost enveloping layer of any animal, if reasonably dense, what can that be\nbut the skin? True, from the unmarred dead body of the whale, you may scrape off\nwith your hand an infinitely thin, transparent substance, somewhat resembling\nthe thinnest shreds of isinglass, only it is almost as flexible and soft as\nsatin; that is, previous to being dried, when it not only contracts and\nthickens, but becomes rather hard and brittle. I have several such dried bits,\nwhich I use for marks in my whale-books. It is transparent, as I said before;\nand being laid upon the printed page, I have sometimes pleased myself with\nfancying it exerted a magnifying influence. At any rate, it is pleasant to read\nabout whales through their own spectacles, as you may say. But what I am driving\nat here is this. That same infinitely thin, isinglass substance, which, I admit,\ninvests the entire body of the whale, is not so much to be regarded as the skin\nof the creature, as the skin of the skin, so to speak; for it were simply\nridiculous to say, that the proper skin of the tremendous whale is thinner and\nmore tender than the skin of a new-born child. But no more of this.\n\nAssuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale; then, when this skin, as in\nthe case of a very large Sperm Whale, will yield the bulk of one hundred barrels\nof oil; and, when it is considered that, in quantity, or rather weight, that\noil, in its expressed state, is only three fourths, and not the entire substance\nof the coat; some idea may hence be had of the enormousness of that animated\nmass, a mere part of whose mere integument yields such a lake of liquid as that.\nReckoning ten barrels to the ton, you have ten tons for the net weight of only\nthree quarters of the stuff of the whale’s skin.\n\nIn life, the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least among the many\nmarvels he presents. Almost invariably it is all over obliquely crossed and\nre-crossed with numberless straight marks in thick array, something like those\nin the finest Italian line engravings. But these marks do not seem to be\nimpressed upon the isinglass substance above mentioned, but seem to be seen\nthrough it, as if they were engraved upon the body itself. Nor is this all. In\nsome instances, to the quick, observant eye, those linear marks, as in a\nveritable engraving, but afford the ground for far other delineations. These are\nhieroglyphical; that is, if you call those mysterious cyphers on the walls of\npyramids hieroglyphics, then that is the proper word to use in the present\nconnexion. By my retentive memory of the hieroglyphics upon one Sperm Whale in\nparticular, I was much struck with a plate representing the old Indian\ncharacters chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the\nUpper Mississippi. Like those mystic rocks, too, the mystic-marked whale remains\nundecipherable. This allusion to the Indian rocks reminds me of another thing.\nBesides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the Sperm Whale presents,\nhe not seldom displays the back, and more especially his flanks, effaced in\ngreat part of the regular linear appearance, by reason of numerous rude\nscratches, altogether of an irregular, random aspect. I should say that those\nNew England rocks on the sea-coast, which Agassiz imagines to bear the marks of\nviolent scraping contact with vast floating icebergs—I should say, that those\nrocks must not a little resemble the Sperm Whale in this particular. It also\nseems to me that such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile\ncontact with other whales; for I have most remarked them in the large,\nfull-grown bulls of the species.\n\nA word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the whale.\nIt has already been said, that it is stript from him in long pieces, called\nblanket-pieces. Like most sea-terms, this one is very happy and significant. For\nthe whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber as in a real blanket or counterpane;\nor, still better, an Indian poncho slipt over his head, and skirting his\nextremity. It is by reason of this cosy blanketing of his body, that the whale\nis enabled to keep himself comfortable in all weathers, in all seas, times, and\ntides. What would become of a Greenland whale, say, in those shuddering, icy\nseas of the North, if unsupplied with his cosy surtout? True, other fish are\nfound exceedingly brisk in those Hyperborean waters; but these, be it observed,\nare your cold-blooded, lungless fish, whose very bellies are refrigerators;\ncreatures, that warm themselves under the lee of an iceberg, as a traveller in\nwinter would bask before an inn fire; whereas, like man, the whale has lungs and\nwarm blood. Freeze his blood, and he dies. How wonderful is it then—except after\nexplanation—that this great monster, to whom corporeal warmth is as\nindispensable as it is to man; how wonderful that he should be found at home,\nimmersed to his lips for life in those Arctic waters! where, when seamen fall\noverboard, they are sometimes found, months afterwards, perpendicularly frozen\ninto the hearts of fields of ice, as a fly is found glued in amber. But more\nsurprising is it to know, as has been proved by experiment, that the blood of a\nPolar whale is warmer than that of a Borneo negro in summer.\n\nIt does seem to me, that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong individual\nvitality, and the rare virtue of thick walls, and the rare virtue of interior\nspaciousness. Oh, man! admire and model thyself after the whale! Do thou, too,\nremain warm among ice. Do thou, too, live in this world without being of it. Be\ncool at the equator; keep thy blood fluid at the Pole. Like the great dome of\nSt. Peter’s, and like the great whale, retain, O man! in all seasons a\ntemperature of thine own.\n\nBut how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things! Of erections, how few\nare domed like St. Peter’s! of creatures, how few vast as the whale!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 69. THE FUNERAL.\n\n“Haul in the chains! Let the carcase go astern!”\n\nThe vast tackles have now done their duty. The peeled white body of the beheaded\nwhale flashes like a marble sepulchre; though changed in hue, it has not\nperceptibly lost anything in bulk. It is still colossal. Slowly it floats more\nand more away, the water round it torn and splashed by the insatiate sharks, and\nthe air above vexed with rapacious flights of screaming fowls, whose beaks are\nlike so many insulting poniards in the whale. The vast white headless phantom\nfloats further and further from the ship, and every rod that it so floats, what\nseem square roods of sharks and cubic roods of fowls, augment the murderous din.\nFor hours and hours from the almost stationary ship that hideous sight is seen.\nBeneath the unclouded and mild azure sky, upon the fair face of the pleasant\nsea, wafted by the joyous breezes, that great mass of death floats on and on,\ntill lost in infinite perspectives.\n\nThere’s a most doleful and most mocking funeral! The sea-vultures all in pious\nmourning, the air-sharks all punctiliously in black or speckled. In life but few\nof them would have helped the whale, I ween, if peradventure he had needed it;\nbut upon the banquet of his funeral they most piously do pounce. Oh, horrible\nvultureism of earth! from which not the mightiest whale is free.\n\nNor is this the end. Desecrated as the body is, a vengeful ghost survives and\nhovers over it to scare. Espied by some timid man-of-war or blundering\ndiscovery-vessel from afar, when the distance obscuring the swarming fowls,\nnevertheless still shows the white mass floating in the sun, and the white spray\nheaving high against it; straightway the whale’s unharming corpse, with\ntrembling fingers is set down in the log—shoals, rocks, and breakers hereabouts:\nbeware! And for years afterwards, perhaps, ships shun the place; leaping over it\nas silly sheep leap over a vacuum, because their leader originally leaped there\nwhen a stick was held. There’s your law of precedents; there’s your utility of\ntraditions; there’s the story of your obstinate survival of old beliefs never\nbottomed on the earth, and now not even hovering in the air! There’s orthodoxy!\n\nThus, while in life the great whale’s body may have been a real terror to his\nfoes, in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic to a world.\n\nAre you a believer in ghosts, my friend? There are other ghosts than the\nCock-Lane one, and far deeper men than Doctor Johnson who believe in them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 70. THE SPHYNX.\n\nIt should not have been omitted that previous to completely stripping the body\nof the leviathan, he was beheaded. Now, the beheading of the Sperm Whale is a\nscientific anatomical feat, upon which experienced whale surgeons very much\npride themselves: and not without reason.\n\nConsider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck; on the\ncontrary, where his head and body seem to join, there, in that very place, is\nthe thickest part of him. Remember, also, that the surgeon must operate from\nabove, some eight or ten feet intervening between him and his subject, and that\nsubject almost hidden in a discoloured, rolling, and oftentimes tumultuous and\nbursting sea. Bear in mind, too, that under these untoward circumstances he has\nto cut many feet deep in the flesh; and in that subterraneous manner, without so\nmuch as getting one single peep into the ever-contracting gash thus made, he\nmust skilfully steer clear of all adjacent, interdicted parts, and exactly\ndivide the spine at a critical point hard by its insertion into the skull. Do\nyou not marvel, then, at Stubb’s boast, that he demanded but ten minutes to\nbehead a sperm whale?\n\nWhen first severed, the head is dropped astern and held there by a cable till\nthe body is stripped. That done, if it belong to a small whale it is hoisted on\ndeck to be deliberately disposed of. But, with a full grown leviathan this is\nimpossible; for the sperm whale’s head embraces nearly one third of his entire\nbulk, and completely to suspend such a burden as that, even by the immense\ntackles of a whaler, this were as vain a thing as to attempt weighing a Dutch\nbarn in jewellers’ scales.\n\nThe Pequod’s whale being decapitated and the body stripped, the head was hoisted\nagainst the ship’s side—about half way out of the sea, so that it might yet in\ngreat part be buoyed up by its native element. And there with the strained craft\nsteeply leaning over to it, by reason of the enormous downward drag from the\nlower mast-head, and every yard-arm on that side projecting like a crane over\nthe waves; there, that blood-dripping head hung to the Pequod’s waist like the\ngiant Holofernes’s from the girdle of Judith.\n\nWhen this last task was accomplished it was noon, and the seamen went below to\ntheir dinner. Silence reigned over the before tumultuous but now deserted deck.\nAn intense copper calm, like a universal yellow lotus, was more and more\nunfolding its noiseless measureless leaves upon the sea.\n\nA short space elapsed, and up into this noiselessness came Ahab alone from his\ncabin. Taking a few turns on the quarter-deck, he paused to gaze over the side,\nthen slowly getting into the main-chains he took Stubb’s long spade—still\nremaining there after the whale’s decapitation—and striking it into the lower\npart of the half-suspended mass, placed its other end crutch-wise under one arm,\nand so stood leaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head.\n\nIt was a black and hooded head; and hanging there in the midst of so intense a\ncalm, it seemed the Sphynx’s in the desert. “Speak, thou vast and venerable\nhead,” muttered Ahab, “which, though ungarnished with a beard, yet here and\nthere lookest hoary with mosses; speak, mighty head, and tell us the secret\nthing that is in thee. Of all divers, thou hast dived the deepest. That head\nupon which the upper sun now gleams, has moved amid this world’s foundations.\nWhere unrecorded names and navies rust, and untold hopes and anchors rot; where\nin her murderous hold this frigate earth is ballasted with bones of millions of\nthe drowned; there, in that awful water-land, there was thy most familiar home.\nThou hast been where bell or diver never went; hast slept by many a sailor’s\nside, where sleepless mothers would give their lives to lay them down. Thou\nsaw’st the locked lovers when leaping from their flaming ship; heart to heart\nthey sank beneath the exulting wave; true to each other, when heaven seemed\nfalse to them. Thou saw’st the murdered mate when tossed by pirates from the\nmidnight deck; for hours he fell into the deeper midnight of the insatiate maw;\nand his murderers still sailed on unharmed—while swift lightnings shivered the\nneighboring ship that would have borne a righteous husband to outstretched,\nlonging arms. O head! thou hast seen enough to split the planets and make an\ninfidel of Abraham, and not one syllable is thine!”\n\n“Sail ho!” cried a triumphant voice from the main-mast-head.\n\n“Aye? Well, now, that’s cheering,” cried Ahab, suddenly erecting himself, while\nwhole thunder-clouds swept aside from his brow. “That lively cry upon this\ndeadly calm might almost convert a better man.—Where away?”\n\n“Three points on the starboard bow, sir, and bringing down her breeze to us!\n\n“Better and better, man. Would now St. Paul would come along that way, and to my\nbreezelessness bring his breeze! O Nature, and O soul of man! how far beyond all\nutterance are your linked analogies! not the smallest atom stirs or lives on\nmatter, but has its cunning duplicate in mind.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 71. THE JEROBOAM’S STORY.\n\nHand in hand, ship and breeze blew on; but the breeze came faster than the ship,\nand soon the Pequod began to rock.\n\nBy and by, through the glass the stranger’s boats and manned mast-heads proved\nher a whale-ship. But as she was so far to windward, and shooting by, apparently\nmaking a passage to some other ground, the Pequod could not hope to reach her.\nSo the signal was set to see what response would be made.\n\nHere be it said, that like the vessels of military marines, the ships of the\nAmerican Whale Fleet have each a private signal; all which signals being\ncollected in a book with the names of the respective vessels attached, every\ncaptain is provided with it. Thereby, the whale commanders are enabled to\nrecognise each other upon the ocean, even at considerable distances and with no\nsmall facility.\n\nThe Pequod’s signal was at last responded to by the stranger’s setting her own;\nwhich proved the ship to be the Jeroboam of Nantucket. Squaring her yards, she\nbore down, ranged abeam under the Pequod’s lee, and lowered a boat; it soon drew\nnigh; but, as the side-ladder was being rigged by Starbuck’s order to\naccommodate the visiting captain, the stranger in question waved his hand from\nhis boat’s stern in token of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary. It\nturned out that the Jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board, and that Mayhew,\nher captain, was fearful of infecting the Pequod’s company. For, though himself\nand boat’s crew remained untainted, and though his ship was half a rifle-shot\noff, and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and flowing between; yet\nconscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine of the land, he peremptorily\nrefused to come into direct contact with the Pequod.\n\nBut this did by no means prevent all communications. Preserving an interval of\nsome few yards between itself and the ship, the Jeroboam’s boat by the\noccasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel to the Pequod, as she\nheavily forged through the sea (for by this time it blew very fresh), with her\nmain-topsail aback; though, indeed, at times by the sudden onset of a large\nrolling wave, the boat would be pushed some way ahead; but would be soon\nskilfully brought to her proper bearings again. Subject to this, and other the\nlike interruptions now and then, a conversation was sustained between the two\nparties; but at intervals not without still another interruption of a very\ndifferent sort.\n\nPulling an oar in the Jeroboam’s boat, was a man of a singular appearance, even\nin that wild whaling life where individual notabilities make up all totalities.\nHe was a small, short, youngish man, sprinkled all over his face with freckles,\nand wearing redundant yellow hair. A long-skirted, cabalistically-cut coat of a\nfaded walnut tinge enveloped him; the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled\nup on his wrists. A deep, settled, fanatic delirium was in his eyes.\n\nSo soon as this figure had been first descried, Stubb had exclaimed—“That’s he!\nthat’s he!—the long-togged scaramouch the Town-Ho’s company told us of!” Stubb\nhere alluded to a strange story told of the Jeroboam, and a certain man among\nher crew, some time previous when the Pequod spoke the Town-Ho. According to\nthis account and what was subsequently learned, it seemed that the scaramouch in\nquestion had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the\nJeroboam. His story was this:\n\nHe had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of Neskyeuna Shakers,\nwhere he had been a great prophet; in their cracked, secret meetings having\nseveral times descended from heaven by the way of a trap-door, announcing the\nspeedy opening of the seventh vial, which he carried in his vest-pocket; but,\nwhich, instead of containing gunpowder, was supposed to be charged with\nlaudanum. A strange, apostolic whim having seized him, he had left Neskyeuna for\nNantucket, where, with that cunning peculiar to craziness, he assumed a steady,\ncommon-sense exterior, and offered himself as a green-hand candidate for the\nJeroboam’s whaling voyage. They engaged him; but straightway upon the ship’s\ngetting out of sight of land, his insanity broke out in a freshet. He announced\nhimself as the archangel Gabriel, and commanded the captain to jump overboard.\nHe published his manifesto, whereby he set himself forth as the deliverer of the\nisles of the sea and vicar-general of all Oceanica. The unflinching earnestness\nwith which he declared these things;—the dark, daring play of his sleepless,\nexcited imagination, and all the preternatural terrors of real delirium, united\nto invest this Gabriel in the minds of the majority of the ignorant crew, with\nan atmosphere of sacredness. Moreover, they were afraid of him. As such a man,\nhowever, was not of much practical use in the ship, especially as he refused to\nwork except when he pleased, the incredulous captain would fain have been rid of\nhim; but apprised that that individual’s intention was to land him in the first\nconvenient port, the archangel forthwith opened all his seals and vials—devoting\nthe ship and all hands to unconditional perdition, in case this intention was\ncarried out. So strongly did he work upon his disciples among the crew, that at\nlast in a body they went to the captain and told him if Gabriel was sent from\nthe ship, not a man of them would remain. He was therefore forced to relinquish\nhis plan. Nor would they permit Gabriel to be any way maltreated, say or do what\nhe would; so that it came to pass that Gabriel had the complete freedom of the\nship. The consequence of all this was, that the archangel cared little or\nnothing for the captain and mates; and since the epidemic had broken out, he\ncarried a higher hand than ever; declaring that the plague, as he called it, was\nat his sole command; nor should it be stayed but according to his good pleasure.\nThe sailors, mostly poor devils, cringed, and some of them fawned before him; in\nobedience to his instructions, sometimes rendering him personal homage, as to a\ngod. Such things may seem incredible; but, however wondrous, they are true. Nor\nis the history of fanatics half so striking in respect to the measureless\nself-deception of the fanatic himself, as his measureless power of deceiving and\nbedevilling so many others. But it is time to return to the Pequod.\n\n“I fear not thy epidemic, man,” said Ahab from the bulwarks, to Captain Mayhew,\nwho stood in the boat’s stern; “come on board.”\n\nBut now Gabriel started to his feet.\n\n“Think, think of the fevers, yellow and bilious! Beware of the horrible plague!”\n\n“Gabriel! Gabriel!” cried Captain Mayhew; “thou must either—” But that instant a\nheadlong wave shot the boat far ahead, and its seethings drowned all speech.\n\n“Hast thou seen the White Whale?” demanded Ahab, when the boat drifted back.\n\n“Think, think of thy whale-boat, stoven and sunk! Beware of the horrible tail!”\n\n“I tell thee again, Gabriel, that—” But again the boat tore ahead as if dragged\nby fiends. Nothing was said for some moments, while a succession of riotous\nwaves rolled by, which by one of those occasional caprices of the seas were\ntumbling, not heaving it. Meantime, the hoisted sperm whale’s head jogged about\nvery violently, and Gabriel was seen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness\nthan his archangel nature seemed to warrant.\n\nWhen this interlude was over, Captain Mayhew began a dark story concerning Moby\nDick; not, however, without frequent interruptions from Gabriel, whenever his\nname was mentioned, and the crazy sea that seemed leagued with him.\n\nIt seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home, when upon speaking a\nwhale-ship, her people were reliably apprised of the existence of Moby Dick, and\nthe havoc he had made. Greedily sucking in this intelligence, Gabriel solemnly\nwarned the captain against attacking the White Whale, in case the monster should\nbe seen; in his gibbering insanity, pronouncing the White Whale to be no less a\nbeing than the Shaker God incarnated; the Shakers receiving the Bible. But when,\nsome year or two afterwards, Moby Dick was fairly sighted from the mast-heads,\nMacey, the chief mate, burned with ardour to encounter him; and the captain\nhimself being not unwilling to let him have the opportunity, despite all the\narchangel’s denunciations and forewarnings, Macey succeeded in persuading five\nmen to man his boat. With them he pushed off; and, after much weary pulling, and\nmany perilous, unsuccessful onsets, he at last succeeded in getting one iron\nfast. Meantime, Gabriel, ascending to the main-royal mast-head, was tossing one\narm in frantic gestures, and hurling forth prophecies of speedy doom to the\nsacrilegious assailants of his divinity. Now, while Macey, the mate, was\nstanding up in his boat’s bow, and with all the reckless energy of his tribe was\nventing his wild exclamations upon the whale, and essaying to get a fair chance\nfor his poised lance, lo! a broad white shadow rose from the sea; by its quick,\nfanning motion, temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies of the oarsmen.\nNext instant, the luckless mate, so full of furious life, was smitten bodily\ninto the air, and making a long arc in his descent, fell into the sea at the\ndistance of about fifty yards. Not a chip of the boat was harmed, nor a hair of\nany oarsman’s head; but the mate for ever sank.\n\nIt is well to parenthesize here, that of the fatal accidents in the Sperm-Whale\nFishery, this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any. Sometimes, nothing is\ninjured but the man who is thus annihilated; oftener the boat’s bow is knocked\noff, or the thigh-board, in which the headsman stands, is torn from its place\nand accompanies the body. But strangest of all is the circumstance, that in more\ninstances than one, when the body has been recovered, not a single mark of\nviolence is discernible; the man being stark dead.\n\nThe whole calamity, with the falling form of Macey, was plainly descried from\nthe ship. Raising a piercing shriek—“The vial! the vial!” Gabriel called off the\nterror-stricken crew from the further hunting of the whale. This terrible event\nclothed the archangel with added influence; because his credulous disciples\nbelieved that he had specifically fore-announced it, instead of only making a\ngeneral prophecy, which any one might have done, and so have chanced to hit one\nof many marks in the wide margin allowed. He became a nameless terror to the\nship.\n\nMayhew having concluded his narration, Ahab put such questions to him, that the\nstranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he intended to hunt the\nWhite Whale, if opportunity should offer. To which Ahab answered—“Aye.”\nStraightway, then, Gabriel once more started to his feet, glaring upon the old\nman, and vehemently exclaimed, with downward pointed finger—“Think, think of the\nblasphemer—dead, and down there!—beware of the blasphemer’s end!”\n\nAhab stolidly turned aside; then said to Mayhew, “Captain, I have just bethought\nme of my letter-bag; there is a letter for one of thy officers, if I mistake\nnot. Starbuck, look over the bag.”\n\nEvery whale-ship takes out a goodly number of letters for various ships, whose\ndelivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed, depends upon the mere\nchance of encountering them in the four oceans. Thus, most letters never reach\ntheir mark; and many are only received after attaining an age of two or three\nyears or more.\n\nSoon Starbuck returned with a letter in his hand. It was sorely tumbled, damp,\nand covered with a dull, spotted, green mould, in consequence of being kept in a\ndark locker of the cabin. Of such a letter, Death himself might well have been\nthe post-boy.\n\n“Can’st not read it?” cried Ahab. “Give it me, man. Aye, aye, it’s but a dim\nscrawl;—what’s this?” As he was studying it out, Starbuck took a long\ncutting-spade pole, and with his knife slightly split the end, to insert the\nletter there, and in that way, hand it to the boat, without its coming any\ncloser to the ship.\n\nMeantime, Ahab holding the letter, muttered, “Mr. Har—yes, Mr. Harry—(a woman’s\npinny hand,—the man’s wife, I’ll wager)—Aye—Mr. Harry Macey, Ship Jeroboam;—why\nit’s Macey, and he’s dead!”\n\n“Poor fellow! poor fellow! and from his wife,” sighed Mayhew; “but let me have\nit.”\n\n“Nay, keep it thyself,” cried Gabriel to Ahab; “thou art soon going that way.”\n\n“Curses throttle thee!” yelled Ahab. “Captain Mayhew, stand by now to receive\nit”; and taking the fatal missive from Starbuck’s hands, he caught it in the\nslit of the pole, and reached it over towards the boat. But as he did so, the\noarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing; the boat drifted a little towards the\nship’s stern; so that, as if by magic, the letter suddenly ranged along with\nGabriel’s eager hand. He clutched it in an instant, seized the boat-knife, and\nimpaling the letter on it, sent it thus loaded back into the ship. It fell at\nAhab’s feet. Then Gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their\noars, and in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the Pequod.\n\nAs, after this interlude, the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket of the\nwhale, many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild affair.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 72. THE MONKEY-ROPE.\n\nIn the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale, there is much\nrunning backwards and forwards among the crew. Now hands are wanted here, and\nthen again hands are wanted there. There is no staying in any one place; for at\none and the same time everything has to be done everywhere. It is much the same\nwith him who endeavors the description of the scene. We must now retrace our way\na little. It was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whale’s back,\nthe blubber-hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of\nthe mates. But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed\nin that hole? It was inserted there by my particular friend Queequeg, whose duty\nit was, as harpooneer, to descend upon the monster’s back for the special\npurpose referred to. But in very many cases, circumstances require that the\nharpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole flensing or stripping\noperation is concluded. The whale, be it observed, lies almost entirely\nsubmerged, excepting the immediate parts operated upon. So down there, some ten\nfeet below the level of the deck, the poor harpooneer flounders about, half on\nthe whale and half in the water, as the vast mass revolves like a tread-mill\nbeneath him. On the occasion in question, Queequeg figured in the Highland\ncostume—a shirt and socks—in which to my eyes, at least, he appeared to uncommon\nadvantage; and no one had a better chance to observe him, as will presently be\nseen.\n\nBeing the savage’s bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the bow-oar in his\nboat (the second one from forward), it was my cheerful duty to attend upon him\nwhile taking that hard-scrabble scramble upon the dead whale’s back. You have\nseen Italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by a long cord. Just so, from the\nship’s steep side, did I hold Queequeg down there in the sea, by what is\ntechnically called in the fishery a monkey-rope, attached to a strong strip of\ncanvas belted round his waist.\n\nIt was a humorously perilous business for both of us. For, before we proceed\nfurther, it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at both ends; fast to\nQueequeg’s broad canvas belt, and fast to my narrow leather one. So that for\nbetter or for worse, we two, for the time, were wedded; and should poor Queequeg\nsink to rise no more, then both usage and honor demanded, that instead of\ncutting the cord, it should drag me down in his wake. So, then, an elongated\nSiamese ligature united us. Queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother; nor\ncould I any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond\nentailed.\n\nSo strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then, that while\nearnestly watching his motions, I seemed distinctly to perceive that my own\nindividuality was now merged in a joint stock company of two; that my free will\nhad received a mortal wound; and that another’s mistake or misfortune might\nplunge innocent me into unmerited disaster and death. Therefore, I saw that here\nwas a sort of interregnum in Providence; for its even-handed equity never could\nhave so gross an injustice. And yet still further pondering—while I jerked him\nnow and then from between the whale and ship, which would threaten to jam\nhim—still further pondering, I say, I saw that this situation of mine was the\nprecise situation of every mortal that breathes; only, in most cases, he, one\nway or other, has this Siamese connexion with a plurality of other mortals. If\nyour banker breaks, you snap; if your apothecary by mistake sends you poison in\nyour pills, you die. True, you may say that, by exceeding caution, you may\npossibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil chances of life. But\nhandle Queequeg’s monkey-rope heedfully as I would, sometimes he jerked it so,\nthat I came very near sliding overboard. Nor could I possibly forget that, do\nwhat I would, I only had the management of one end of it.*\n\n*The monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in the Pequod that the\nmonkey and his holder were ever tied together. This improvement upon the\noriginal usage was introduced by no less a man than Stubb, in order to afford\nthe imperilled harpooneer the strongest possible guarantee for the faithfulness\nand vigilance of his monkey-rope holder.\n\nI have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the whale and\nthe ship—where he would occasionally fall, from the incessant rolling and\nswaying of both. But this was not the only jamming jeopardy he was exposed to.\nUnappalled by the massacre made upon them during the night, the sharks now\nfreshly and more keenly allured by the before pent blood which began to flow\nfrom the carcass—the rabid creatures swarmed round it like bees in a beehive.\n\nAnd right in among those sharks was Queequeg; who often pushed them aside with\nhis floundering feet. A thing altogether incredible were it not that attracted\nby such prey as a dead whale, the otherwise miscellaneously carnivorous shark\nwill seldom touch a man.\n\nNevertheless, it may well be believed that since they have such a ravenous\nfinger in the pie, it is deemed but wise to look sharp to them. Accordingly,\nbesides the monkey-rope, with which I now and then jerked the poor fellow from\ntoo close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed a peculiarly ferocious shark—he\nwas provided with still another protection. Suspended over the side in one of\nthe stages, Tashtego and Daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of\nkeen whale-spades, wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could\nreach. This procedure of theirs, to be sure, was very disinterested and\nbenevolent of them. They meant Queequeg’s best happiness, I admit; but in their\nhasty zeal to befriend him, and from the circumstance that both he and the\nsharks were at times half hidden by the blood-muddled water, those indiscreet\nspades of theirs would come nearer amputating a leg than a tail. But poor\nQueequeg, I suppose, straining and gasping there with that great iron hook—poor\nQueequeg, I suppose, only prayed to his Yojo, and gave up his life into the\nhands of his gods.\n\nWell, well, my dear comrade and twin-brother, thought I, as I drew in and then\nslacked off the rope to every swell of the sea—what matters it, after all? Are\nyou not the precious image of each and all of us men in this whaling world? That\nunsounded ocean you gasp in, is Life; those sharks, your foes; those spades,\nyour friends; and what between sharks and spades you are in a sad pickle and\nperil, poor lad.\n\nBut courage! there is good cheer in store for you, Queequeg. For now, as with\nblue lips and blood-shot eyes the exhausted savage at last climbs up the chains\nand stands all dripping and involuntarily trembling over the side; the steward\nadvances, and with a benevolent, consolatory glance hands him—what? Some hot\nCognac? No! hands him, ye gods! hands him a cup of tepid ginger and water!\n\n“Ginger? Do I smell ginger?” suspiciously asked Stubb, coming near. “Yes, this\nmust be ginger,” peering into the as yet untasted cup. Then standing as if\nincredulous for a while, he calmly walked towards the astonished steward slowly\nsaying, “Ginger? ginger? and will you have the goodness to tell me, Mr.\nDough-Boy, where lies the virtue of ginger? Ginger! is ginger the sort of fuel\nyou use, Dough-boy, to kindle a fire in this shivering cannibal? Ginger!—what\nthe devil is ginger? Sea-coal? firewood?—lucifer\nmatches?—tinder?—gunpowder?—what the devil is ginger, I say, that you offer this\ncup to our poor Queequeg here.”\n\n“There is some sneaking Temperance Society movement about this business,” he\nsuddenly added, now approaching Starbuck, who had just come from forward. “Will\nyou look at that kannakin, sir: smell of it, if you please.” Then watching the\nmate’s countenance, he added, “The steward, Mr. Starbuck, had the face to offer\nthat calomel and jalap to Queequeg, there, this instant off the whale. Is the\nsteward an apothecary, sir? and may I ask whether this is the sort of bitters by\nwhich he blows back the life into a half-drowned man?”\n\n“I trust not,” said Starbuck, “it is poor stuff enough.”\n\n“Aye, aye, steward,” cried Stubb, “we’ll teach you to drug a harpooneer; none of\nyour apothecary’s medicine here; you want to poison us, do ye? You have got out\ninsurances on our lives and want to murder us all, and pocket the proceeds, do\nye?”\n\n“It was not me,” cried Dough-Boy, “it was Aunt Charity that brought the ginger\non board; and bade me never give the harpooneers any spirits, but only this\nginger-jub—so she called it.”\n\n“Ginger-jub! you gingerly rascal! take that! and run along with ye to the\nlockers, and get something better. I hope I do no wrong, Mr. Starbuck. It is the\ncaptain’s orders—grog for the harpooneer on a whale.”\n\n“Enough,” replied Starbuck, “only don’t hit him again, but—”\n\n“Oh, I never hurt when I hit, except when I hit a whale or something of that\nsort; and this fellow’s a weazel. What were you about saying, sir?”\n\n“Only this: go down with him, and get what thou wantest thyself.”\n\nWhen Stubb reappeared, he came with a dark flask in one hand, and a sort of\ntea-caddy in the other. The first contained strong spirits, and was handed to\nQueequeg; the second was Aunt Charity’s gift, and that was freely given to the\nwaves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 73. STUBB AND FLASK KILL A RIGHT WHALE; AND THEN HAVE A TALK OVER HIM.\n\nIt must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm Whale’s prodigious\nhead hanging to the Pequod’s side. But we must let it continue hanging there a\nwhile till we can get a chance to attend to it. For the present other matters\npress, and the best we can do now for the head, is to pray heaven the tackles\nmay hold.\n\nNow, during the past night and forenoon, the Pequod had gradually drifted into a\nsea, which, by its occasional patches of yellow brit, gave unusual tokens of the\nvicinity of Right Whales, a species of the Leviathan that but few supposed to be\nat this particular time lurking anywhere near. And though all hands commonly\ndisdained the capture of those inferior creatures; and though the Pequod was not\ncommissioned to cruise for them at all, and though she had passed numbers of\nthem near the Crozetts without lowering a boat; yet now that a Sperm Whale had\nbeen brought alongside and beheaded, to the surprise of all, the announcement\nwas made that a Right Whale should be captured that day, if opportunity offered.\n\nNor was this long wanting. Tall spouts were seen to leeward; and two boats,\nStubb’s and Flask’s, were detached in pursuit. Pulling further and further away,\nthey at last became almost invisible to the men at the mast-head. But suddenly\nin the distance, they saw a great heap of tumultuous white water, and soon after\nnews came from aloft that one or both the boats must be fast. An interval passed\nand the boats were in plain sight, in the act of being dragged right towards the\nship by the towing whale. So close did the monster come to the hull, that at\nfirst it seemed as if he meant it malice; but suddenly going down in a\nmaelstrom, within three rods of the planks, he wholly disappeared from view, as\nif diving under the keel. “Cut, cut!” was the cry from the ship to the boats,\nwhich, for one instant, seemed on the point of being brought with a deadly dash\nagainst the vessel’s side. But having plenty of line yet in the tubs, and the\nwhale not sounding very rapidly, they paid out abundance of rope, and at the\nsame time pulled with all their might so as to get ahead of the ship. For a few\nminutes the struggle was intensely critical; for while they still slacked out\nthe tightened line in one direction, and still plied their oars in another, the\ncontending strain threatened to take them under. But it was only a few feet\nadvance they sought to gain. And they stuck to it till they did gain it; when\ninstantly, a swift tremor was felt running like lightning along the keel, as the\nstrained line, scraping beneath the ship, suddenly rose to view under her bows,\nsnapping and quivering; and so flinging off its drippings, that the drops fell\nlike bits of broken glass on the water, while the whale beyond also rose to\nsight, and once more the boats were free to fly. But the fagged whale abated his\nspeed, and blindly altering his course, went round the stern of the ship towing\nthe two boats after him, so that they performed a complete circuit.\n\nMeantime, they hauled more and more upon their lines, till close flanking him on\nboth sides, Stubb answered Flask with lance for lance; and thus round and round\nthe Pequod the battle went, while the multitudes of sharks that had before swum\nround the Sperm Whale’s body, rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled,\nthirstily drinking at every new gash, as the eager Israelites did at the new\nbursting fountains that poured from the smitten rock.\n\nAt last his spout grew thick, and with a frightful roll and vomit, he turned\nupon his back a corpse.\n\nWhile the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes, and in\nother ways getting the mass in readiness for towing, some conversation ensued\nbetween them.\n\n“I wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard,” said Stubb, not\nwithout some disgust at the thought of having to do with so ignoble a leviathan.\n\n“Wants with it?” said Flask, coiling some spare line in the boat’s bow, “did you\nnever hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm Whale’s head hoisted on her\nstarboard side, and at the same time a Right Whale’s on the larboard; did you\nnever hear, Stubb, that that ship can never afterwards capsize?”\n\n“Why not?\n\n“I don’t know, but I heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah saying so, and he\nseems to know all about ships’ charms. But I sometimes think he’ll charm the\nship to no good at last. I don’t half like that chap, Stubb. Did you ever notice\nhow that tusk of his is a sort of carved into a snake’s head, Stubb?”\n\n“Sink him! I never look at him at all; but if ever I get a chance of a dark\nnight, and he standing hard by the bulwarks, and no one by; look down there,\nFlask”—pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of both hands—“Aye, will I!\nFlask, I take that Fedallah to be the devil in disguise. Do you believe that\ncock and bull story about his having been stowed away on board ship? He’s the\ndevil, I say. The reason why you don’t see his tail, is because he tucks it up\nout of sight; he carries it coiled away in his pocket, I guess. Blast him! now\nthat I think of it, he’s always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his\nboots.”\n\n“He sleeps in his boots, don’t he? He hasn’t got any hammock; but I’ve seen him\nlay of nights in a coil of rigging.”\n\n“No doubt, and it’s because of his cursed tail; he coils it down, do ye see, in\nthe eye of the rigging.”\n\n“What’s the old man have so much to do with him for?”\n\n“Striking up a swap or a bargain, I suppose.”\n\n“Bargain?—about what?”\n\n“Why, do ye see, the old man is hard bent after that White Whale, and the devil\nthere is trying to come round him, and get him to swap away his silver watch, or\nhis soul, or something of that sort, and then he’ll surrender Moby Dick.”\n\n“Pooh! Stubb, you are skylarking; how can Fedallah do that?”\n\n“I don’t know, Flask, but the devil is a curious chap, and a wicked one, I tell\nye. Why, they say as how he went a sauntering into the old flag-ship once,\nswitching his tail about devilish easy and gentlemanlike, and inquiring if the\nold governor was at home. Well, he was at home, and asked the devil what he\nwanted. The devil, switching his hoofs, up and says, ‘I want John.’ ‘What for?’\nsays the old governor. ‘What business is that of yours,’ says the devil, getting\nmad,—‘I want to use him.’ ‘Take him,’ says the governor—and by the Lord, Flask,\nif the devil didn’t give John the Asiatic cholera before he got through with\nhim, I’ll eat this whale in one mouthful. But look sharp—ain’t you all ready\nthere? Well, then, pull ahead, and let’s get the whale alongside.”\n\n“I think I remember some such story as you were telling,” said Flask, when at\nlast the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden towards the ship,\n“but I can’t remember where.”\n\n“Three Spaniards? Adventures of those three bloody-minded soldadoes? Did ye read\nit there, Flask? I guess ye did?”\n\n“No: never saw such a book; heard of it, though. But now, tell me, Stubb, do you\nsuppose that that devil you was speaking of just now, was the same you say is\nnow on board the Pequod?”\n\n“Am I the same man that helped kill this whale? Doesn’t the devil live for ever;\nwho ever heard that the devil was dead? Did you ever see any parson a wearing\nmourning for the devil? And if the devil has a latch-key to get into the\nadmiral’s cabin, don’t you suppose he can crawl into a porthole? Tell me that,\nMr. Flask?”\n\n“How old do you suppose Fedallah is, Stubb?”\n\n“Do you see that mainmast there?” pointing to the ship; “well, that’s the figure\none; now take all the hoops in the Pequod’s hold, and string along in a row with\nthat mast, for oughts, do you see; well, that wouldn’t begin to be Fedallah’s\nage. Nor all the coopers in creation couldn’t show hoops enough to make oughts\nenough.”\n\n“But see here, Stubb, I thought you a little boasted just now, that you meant to\ngive Fedallah a sea-toss, if you got a good chance. Now, if he’s so old as all\nthose hoops of yours come to, and if he is going to live for ever, what good\nwill it do to pitch him overboard—tell me that?\n\n“Give him a good ducking, anyhow.”\n\n“But he’d crawl back.”\n\n“Duck him again; and keep ducking him.”\n\n“Suppose he should take it into his head to duck you, though—yes, and drown\nyou—what then?”\n\n“I should like to see him try it; I’d give him such a pair of black eyes that he\nwouldn’t dare to show his face in the admiral’s cabin again for a long while,\nlet alone down in the orlop there, where he lives, and hereabouts on the upper\ndecks where he sneaks so much. Damn the devil, Flask; so you suppose I’m afraid\nof the devil? Who’s afraid of him, except the old governor who daresn’t catch\nhim and put him in double-darbies, as he deserves, but lets him go about\nkidnapping people; aye, and signed a bond with him, that all the people the\ndevil kidnapped, he’d roast for him? There’s a governor!”\n\n“Do you suppose Fedallah wants to kidnap Captain Ahab?”\n\n“Do I suppose it? You’ll know it before long, Flask. But I am going now to keep\na sharp look-out on him; and if I see anything very suspicious going on, I’ll\njust take him by the nape of his neck, and say—Look here, Beelzebub, you don’t\ndo it; and if he makes any fuss, by the Lord I’ll make a grab into his pocket\nfor his tail, take it to the capstan, and give him such a wrenching and heaving,\nthat his tail will come short off at the stump—do you see; and then, I rather\nguess when he finds himself docked in that queer fashion, he’ll sneak off\nwithout the poor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs.”\n\n“And what will you do with the tail, Stubb?”\n\n“Do with it? Sell it for an ox whip when we get home;—what else?”\n\n“Now, do you mean what you say, and have been saying all along, Stubb?”\n\n“Mean or not mean, here we are at the ship.”\n\nThe boats were here hailed, to tow the whale on the larboard side, where fluke\nchains and other necessaries were already prepared for securing him.\n\n“Didn’t I tell you so?” said Flask; “yes, you’ll soon see this right whale’s\nhead hoisted up opposite that parmacetti’s.”\n\nIn good time, Flask’s saying proved true. As before, the Pequod steeply leaned\nover towards the sperm whale’s head, now, by the counterpoise of both heads, she\nregained her even keel; though sorely strained, you may well believe. So, when\non one side you hoist in Locke’s head, you go over that way; but now, on the\nother side, hoist in Kant’s and you come back again; but in very poor plight.\nThus, some minds for ever keep trimming boat. Oh, ye foolish! throw all these\nthunder-heads overboard, and then you will float light and right.\n\nIn disposing of the body of a right whale, when brought alongside the ship, the\nsame preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the case of a sperm\nwhale; only, in the latter instance, the head is cut off whole, but in the\nformer the lips and tongue are separately removed and hoisted on deck, with all\nthe well known black bone attached to what is called the crown-piece. But\nnothing like this, in the present case, had been done. The carcases of both\nwhales had dropped astern; and the head-laden ship not a little resembled a mule\ncarrying a pair of overburdening panniers.\n\nMeantime, Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale’s head, and ever and anon\nglancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own hand. And Ahab\nchanced so to stand, that the Parsee occupied his shadow; while, if the Parsee’s\nshadow was there at all it seemed only to blend with, and lengthen Ahab’s. As\nthe crew toiled on, Laplandish speculations were bandied among them, concerning\nall these passing things.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 74. THE SPERM WHALE’S HEAD—CONTRASTED VIEW.\n\nHere, now, are two great whales, laying their heads together; let us join them,\nand lay together our own.\n\nOf the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale are\nby far the most noteworthy. They are the only whales regularly hunted by man. To\nthe Nantucketer, they present the two extremes of all the known varieties of the\nwhale. As the external difference between them is mainly observable in their\nheads; and as a head of each is this moment hanging from the Pequod’s side; and\nas we may freely go from one to the other, by merely stepping across the\ndeck:—where, I should like to know, will you obtain a better chance to study\npractical cetology than here?\n\nIn the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between these heads.\nBoth are massive enough in all conscience; but there is a certain mathematical\nsymmetry in the Sperm Whale’s which the Right Whale’s sadly lacks. There is more\ncharacter in the Sperm Whale’s head. As you behold it, you involuntarily yield\nthe immense superiority to him, in point of pervading dignity. In the present\ninstance, too, this dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his\nhead at the summit, giving token of advanced age and large experience. In short,\nhe is what the fishermen technically call a “grey-headed whale.”\n\nLet us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads—namely, the two most\nimportant organs, the eye and the ear. Far back on the side of the head, and low\ndown, near the angle of either whale’s jaw, if you narrowly search, you will at\nlast see a lashless eye, which you would fancy to be a young colt’s eye; so out\nof all proportion is it to the magnitude of the head.\n\nNow, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale’s eyes, it is plain that\nhe can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more than he can one\nexactly astern. In a word, the position of the whale’s eyes corresponds to that\nof a man’s ears; and you may fancy, for yourself, how it would fare with you,\ndid you sideways survey objects through your ears. You would find that you could\nonly command some thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight side-line\nof sight; and about thirty more behind it. If your bitterest foe were walking\nstraight towards you, with dagger uplifted in broad day, you would not be able\nto see him, any more than if he were stealing upon you from behind. In a word,\nyou would have two backs, so to speak; but, at the same time, also, two fronts\n(side fronts): for what is it that makes the front of a man—what, indeed, but\nhis eyes?\n\nMoreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the eyes are so\nplanted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so as to produce one\npicture and not two to the brain; the peculiar position of the whale’s eyes,\neffectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of solid head, which towers\nbetween them like a great mountain separating two lakes in valleys; this, of\ncourse, must wholly separate the impressions which each independent organ\nimparts. The whale, therefore, must see one distinct picture on this side, and\nanother distinct picture on that side; while all between must be profound\ndarkness and nothingness to him. Man may, in effect, be said to look out on the\nworld from a sentry-box with two joined sashes for his window. But with the\nwhale, these two sashes are separately inserted, making two distinct windows,\nbut sadly impairing the view. This peculiarity of the whale’s eyes is a thing\nalways to be borne in mind in the fishery; and to be remembered by the reader in\nsome subsequent scenes.\n\nA curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this visual\nmatter as touching the Leviathan. But I must be content with a hint. So long as\na man’s eyes are open in the light, the act of seeing is involuntary; that is,\nhe cannot then help mechanically seeing whatever objects are before him.\nNevertheless, any one’s experience will teach him, that though he can take in an\nundiscriminating sweep of things at one glance, it is quite impossible for him,\nattentively, and completely, to examine any two things—however large or however\nsmall—at one and the same instant of time; never mind if they lie side by side\nand touch each other. But if you now come to separate these two objects, and\nsurround each by a circle of profound darkness; then, in order to see one of\nthem, in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it, the other will be\nutterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness. How is it, then, with the\nwhale? True, both his eyes, in themselves, must simultaneously act; but is his\nbrain so much more comprehensive, combining, and subtle than man’s, that he can\nat the same moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on\none side of him, and the other in an exactly opposite direction? If he can, then\nis it as marvellous a thing in him, as if a man were able simultaneously to go\nthrough the demonstrations of two distinct problems in Euclid. Nor, strictly\ninvestigated, is there any incongruity in this comparison.\n\nIt may be but an idle whim, but it has always seemed to me, that the\nextraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when beset by\nthree or four boats; the timidity and liability to queer frights, so common to\nsuch whales; I think that all this indirectly proceeds from the helpless\nperplexity of volition, in which their divided and diametrically opposite powers\nof vision must involve them.\n\nBut the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye. If you are an entire\nstranger to their race, you might hunt over these two heads for hours, and never\ndiscover that organ. The ear has no external leaf whatever; and into the hole\nitself you can hardly insert a quill, so wondrously minute is it. It is lodged a\nlittle behind the eye. With respect to their ears, this important difference is\nto be observed between the sperm whale and the right. While the ear of the\nformer has an external opening, that of the latter is entirely and evenly\ncovered over with a membrane, so as to be quite imperceptible from without.\n\nIs it not curious, that so vast a being as the whale should see the world\nthrough so small an eye, and hear the thunder through an ear which is smaller\nthan a hare’s? But if his eyes were broad as the lens of Herschel’s great\ntelescope; and his ears capacious as the porches of cathedrals; would that make\nhim any longer of sight, or sharper of hearing? Not at all.—Why then do you try\nto “enlarge” your mind? Subtilize it.\n\nLet us now with whatever levers and steam-engines we have at hand, cant over the\nsperm whale’s head, that it may lie bottom up; then, ascending by a ladder to\nthe summit, have a peep down the mouth; and were it not that the body is now\ncompletely separated from it, with a lantern we might descend into the great\nKentucky Mammoth Cave of his stomach. But let us hold on here by this tooth, and\nlook about us where we are. What a really beautiful and chaste-looking mouth!\nfrom floor to ceiling, lined, or rather papered with a glistening white\nmembrane, glossy as bridal satins.\n\nBut come out now, and look at this portentous lower jaw, which seems like the\nlong narrow lid of an immense snuff-box, with the hinge at one end, instead of\none side. If you pry it up, so as to get it overhead, and expose its rows of\nteeth, it seems a terrific portcullis; and such, alas! it proves to many a poor\nwight in the fishery, upon whom these spikes fall with impaling force. But far\nmore terrible is it to behold, when fathoms down in the sea, you see some sulky\nwhale, floating there suspended, with his prodigious jaw, some fifteen feet\nlong, hanging straight down at right-angles with his body, for all the world\nlike a ship’s jib-boom. This whale is not dead; he is only dispirited; out of\nsorts, perhaps; hypochondriac; and so supine, that the hinges of his jaw have\nrelaxed, leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight, a reproach to all\nhis tribe, who must, no doubt, imprecate lock-jaws upon him.\n\nIn most cases this lower jaw—being easily unhinged by a practised artist—is\ndisengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extracting the ivory teeth,\nand furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone with which the fishermen\nfashion all sorts of curious articles, including canes, umbrella-stocks, and\nhandles to riding-whips.\n\nWith a long, weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board, as if it were an anchor;\nand when the proper time comes—some few days after the other work—Queequeg,\nDaggoo, and Tashtego, being all accomplished dentists, are set to drawing teeth.\nWith a keen cutting-spade, Queequeg lances the gums; then the jaw is lashed down\nto ringbolts, and a tackle being rigged from aloft, they drag out these teeth,\nas Michigan oxen drag stumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands. There are\ngenerally forty-two teeth in all; in old whales, much worn down, but undecayed;\nnor filled after our artificial fashion. The jaw is afterwards sawn into slabs,\nand piled away like joists for building houses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 75. THE RIGHT WHALE’S HEAD—CONTRASTED VIEW.\n\nCrossing the deck, let us now have a good long look at the Right Whale’s head.\n\nAs in general shape the noble Sperm Whale’s head may be compared to a Roman\nwar-chariot (especially in front, where it is so broadly rounded); so, at a\nbroad view, the Right Whale’s head bears a rather inelegant resemblance to a\ngigantic galliot-toed shoe. Two hundred years ago an old Dutch voyager likened\nits shape to that of a shoemaker’s last. And in this same last or shoe, that old\nwoman of the nursery tale, with the swarming brood, might very comfortably be\nlodged, she and all her progeny.\n\nBut as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different aspects,\naccording to your point of view. If you stand on its summit and look at these\ntwo F-shaped spoutholes, you would take the whole head for an enormous\nbass-viol, and these spiracles, the apertures in its sounding-board. Then,\nagain, if you fix your eye upon this strange, crested, comb-like incrustation on\nthe top of the mass—this green, barnacled thing, which the Greenlanders call the\n“crown,” and the Southern fishers the “bonnet” of the Right Whale; fixing your\neyes solely on this, you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak,\nwith a bird’s nest in its crotch. At any rate, when you watch those live crabs\nthat nestle here on this bonnet, such an idea will be almost sure to occur to\nyou; unless, indeed, your fancy has been fixed by the technical term “crown”\nalso bestowed upon it; in which case you will take great interest in thinking\nhow this mighty monster is actually a diademed king of the sea, whose green\ncrown has been put together for him in this marvellous manner. But if this whale\nbe a king, he is a very sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem. Look at that\nhanging lower lip! what a huge sulk and pout is there! a sulk and pout, by\ncarpenter’s measurement, about twenty feet long and five feet deep; a sulk and\npout that will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and more.\n\nA great pity, now, that this unfortunate whale should be hare-lipped. The\nfissure is about a foot across. Probably the mother during an important interval\nwas sailing down the Peruvian coast, when earthquakes caused the beach to gape.\nOver this lip, as over a slippery threshold, we now slide into the mouth. Upon\nmy word were I at Mackinaw, I should take this to be the inside of an Indian\nwigwam. Good Lord! is this the road that Jonah went? The roof is about twelve\nfeet high, and runs to a pretty sharp angle, as if there were a regular\nridge-pole there; while these ribbed, arched, hairy sides, present us with those\nwondrous, half vertical, scimetar-shaped slats of whalebone, say three hundred\non a side, which depending from the upper part of the head or crown bone, form\nthose Venetian blinds which have elsewhere been cursorily mentioned. The edges\nof these bones are fringed with hairy fibres, through which the Right Whale\nstrains the water, and in whose intricacies he retains the small fish, when\nopenmouthed he goes through the seas of brit in feeding time. In the central\nblinds of bone, as they stand in their natural order, there are certain curious\nmarks, curves, hollows, and ridges, whereby some whalemen calculate the\ncreature’s age, as the age of an oak by its circular rings. Though the certainty\nof this criterion is far from demonstrable, yet it has the savor of analogical\nprobability. At any rate, if we yield to it, we must grant a far greater age to\nthe Right Whale than at first glance will seem reasonable.\n\nIn old times, there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies concerning\nthese blinds. One voyager in Purchas calls them the wondrous “whiskers” inside\nof the whale’s mouth;* another, “hogs’ bristles”; a third old gentleman in\nHackluyt uses the following elegant language: “There are about two hundred and\nfifty fins growing on each side of his upper chop, which arch over his tongue on\neach side of his mouth.”\n\n*This reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort of whisker, or rather a\nmoustache, consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the upper part of the\nouter end of the lower jaw. Sometimes these tufts impart a rather brigandish\nexpression to his otherwise solemn countenance.\n\nAs every one knows, these same “hogs’ bristles,” “fins,” “whiskers,” “blinds,”\nor whatever you please, furnish to the ladies their busks and other stiffening\ncontrivances. But in this particular, the demand has long been on the decline.\nIt was in Queen Anne’s time that the bone was in its glory, the farthingale\nbeing then all the fashion. And as those ancient dames moved about gaily, though\nin the jaws of the whale, as you may say; even so, in a shower, with the like\nthoughtlessness, do we nowadays fly under the same jaws for protection; the\numbrella being a tent spread over the same bone.\n\nBut now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment, and, standing in the\nRight Whale’s mouth, look around you afresh. Seeing all these colonnades of bone\nso methodically ranged about, would you not think you were inside of the great\nHaarlem organ, and gazing upon its thousand pipes? For a carpet to the organ we\nhave a rug of the softest Turkey—the tongue, which is glued, as it were, to the\nfloor of the mouth. It is very fat and tender, and apt to tear in pieces in\nhoisting it on deck. This particular tongue now before us; at a passing glance I\nshould say it was a six-barreler; that is, it will yield you about that amount\nof oil.\n\nEre this, you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started with—that the\nSperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirely different heads. To sum up,\nthen: in the Right Whale’s there is no great well of sperm; no ivory teeth at\nall; no long, slender mandible of a lower jaw, like the Sperm Whale’s. Nor in\nthe Sperm Whale are there any of those blinds of bone; no huge lower lip; and\nscarcely anything of a tongue. Again, the Right Whale has two external\nspout-holes, the Sperm Whale only one.\n\nLook your last, now, on these venerable hooded heads, while they yet lie\ntogether; for one will soon sink, unrecorded, in the sea; the other will not be\nvery long in following.\n\nCan you catch the expression of the Sperm Whale’s there? It is the same he died\nwith, only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem now faded away. I\nthink his broad brow to be full of a prairie-like placidity, born of a\nspeculative indifference as to death. But mark the other head’s expression. See\nthat amazing lower lip, pressed by accident against the vessel’s side, so as\nfirmly to embrace the jaw. Does not this whole head seem to speak of an enormous\npractical resolution in facing death? This Right Whale I take to have been a\nStoic; the Sperm Whale, a Platonian, who might have taken up Spinoza in his\nlatter years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 76. THE BATTERING-RAM.\n\nEre quitting, for the nonce, the Sperm Whale’s head, I would have you, as a\nsensible physiologist, simply—particularly remark its front aspect, in all its\ncompacted collectedness. I would have you investigate it now with the sole view\nof forming to yourself some unexaggerated, intelligent estimate of whatever\nbattering-ram power may be lodged there. Here is a vital point; for you must\neither satisfactorily settle this matter with yourself, or for ever remain an\ninfidel as to one of the most appalling, but not the less true events, perhaps\nanywhere to be found in all recorded history.\n\nYou observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm Whale, the front\nof his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the water; you observe\nthat the lower part of that front slopes considerably backwards, so as to\nfurnish more of a retreat for the long socket which receives the boom-like lower\njaw; you observe that the mouth is entirely under the head, much in the same\nway, indeed, as though your own mouth were entirely under your chin. Moreover\nyou observe that the whale has no external nose; and that what nose he has—his\nspout hole—is on the top of his head; you observe that his eyes and ears are at\nthe sides of his head, nearly one third of his entire length from the front.\nWherefore, you must now have perceived that the front of the Sperm Whale’s head\nis a dead, blind wall, without a single organ or tender prominence of any sort\nwhatsoever. Furthermore, you are now to consider that only in the extreme,\nlower, backward sloping part of the front of the head, is there the slightest\nvestige of bone; and not till you get near twenty feet from the forehead do you\ncome to the full cranial development. So that this whole enormous boneless mass\nis as one wad. Finally, though, as will soon be revealed, its contents partly\ncomprise the most delicate oil; yet, you are now to be apprised of the nature of\nthe substance which so impregnably invests all that apparent effeminacy. In some\nprevious place I have described to you how the blubber wraps the body of the\nwhale, as the rind wraps an orange. Just so with the head; but with this\ndifference: about the head this envelope, though not so thick, is of a boneless\ntoughness, inestimable by any man who has not handled it. The severest pointed\nharpoon, the sharpest lance darted by the strongest human arm, impotently\nrebounds from it. It is as though the forehead of the Sperm Whale were paved\nwith horses’ hoofs. I do not think that any sensation lurks in it.\n\nBethink yourself also of another thing. When two large, loaded Indiamen chance\nto crowd and crush towards each other in the docks, what do the sailors do? They\ndo not suspend between them, at the point of coming contact, any merely hard\nsubstance, like iron or wood. No, they hold there a large, round wad of tow and\ncork, enveloped in the thickest and toughest of ox-hide. That bravely and\nuninjured takes the jam which would have snapped all their oaken handspikes and\niron crow-bars. By itself this sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact I drive\nat. But supplementary to this, it has hypothetically occurred to me, that as\nordinary fish possess what is called a swimming bladder in them, capable, at\nwill, of distension or contraction; and as the Sperm Whale, as far as I know,\nhas no such provision in him; considering, too, the otherwise inexplicable\nmanner in which he now depresses his head altogether beneath the surface, and\nanon swims with it high elevated out of the water; considering the unobstructed\nelasticity of its envelope; considering the unique interior of his head; it has\nhypothetically occurred to me, I say, that those mystical lung-celled honeycombs\nthere may possibly have some hitherto unknown and unsuspected connexion with the\nouter air, so as to be susceptible to atmospheric distension and contraction. If\nthis be so, fancy the irresistibleness of that might, to which the most\nimpalpable and destructive of all elements contributes.\n\nNow, mark. Unerringly impelling this dead, impregnable, uninjurable wall, and\nthis most buoyant thing within; there swims behind it all a mass of tremendous\nlife, only to be adequately estimated as piled wood is—by the cord; and all\nobedient to one volition, as the smallest insect. So that when I shall hereafter\ndetail to you all the specialities and concentrations of potency everywhere\nlurking in this expansive monster; when I shall show you some of his more\ninconsiderable braining feats; I trust you will have renounced all ignorant\nincredulity, and be ready to abide by this; that though the Sperm Whale stove a\npassage through the Isthmus of Darien, and mixed the Atlantic with the Pacific,\nyou would not elevate one hair of your eye-brow. For unless you own the whale,\nyou are but a provincial and sentimentalist in Truth. But clear Truth is a thing\nfor salamander giants only to encounter; how small the chances for the\nprovincials then? What befell the weakling youth lifting the dread goddess’s\nveil at Lais?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 77. THE GREAT HEIDELBURGH TUN.\n\nNow comes the Baling of the Case. But to comprehend it aright, you must know\nsomething of the curious internal structure of the thing operated upon.\n\nRegarding the Sperm Whale’s head as a solid oblong, you may, on an inclined\nplane, sideways divide it into two quoins,* whereof the lower is the bony\nstructure, forming the cranium and jaws, and the upper an unctuous mass wholly\nfree from bones; its broad forward end forming the expanded vertical apparent\nforehead of the whale. At the middle of the forehead horizontally subdivide this\nupper quoin, and then you have two almost equal parts, which before were\nnaturally divided by an internal wall of a thick tendinous substance.\n\n*Quoin is not a Euclidean term. It belongs to the pure nautical mathematics. I\nknow not that it has been defined before. A quoin is a solid which differs from\na wedge in having its sharp end formed by the steep inclination of one side,\ninstead of the mutual tapering of both sides.\n\nThe lower subdivided part, called the junk, is one immense honeycomb of oil,\nformed by the crossing and recrossing, into ten thousand infiltrated cells, of\ntough elastic white fibres throughout its whole extent. The upper part, known as\nthe Case, may be regarded as the great Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale. And\nas that famous great tierce is mystically carved in front, so the whale’s vast\nplaited forehead forms innumerable strange devices for the emblematical\nadornment of his wondrous tun. Moreover, as that of Heidelburgh was always\nreplenished with the most excellent of the wines of the Rhenish valleys, so the\ntun of the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oily vintages;\nnamely, the highly-prized spermaceti, in its absolutely pure, limpid, and\nodoriferous state. Nor is this precious substance found unalloyed in any other\npart of the creature. Though in life it remains perfectly fluid, yet, upon\nexposure to the air, after death, it soon begins to concrete; sending forth\nbeautiful crystalline shoots, as when the first thin delicate ice is just\nforming in water. A large whale’s case generally yields about five hundred\ngallons of sperm, though from unavoidable circumstances, considerable of it is\nspilled, leaks, and dribbles away, or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the\nticklish business of securing what you can.\n\nI know not with what fine and costly material the Heidelburgh Tun was coated\nwithin, but in superlative richness that coating could not possibly have\ncompared with the silken pearl-coloured membrane, like the lining of a fine\npelisse, forming the inner surface of the Sperm Whale’s case.\n\nIt will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale embraces the\nentire length of the entire top of the head; and since—as has been elsewhere set\nforth—the head embraces one third of the whole length of the creature, then\nsetting that length down at eighty feet for a good sized whale, you have more\nthan twenty-six feet for the depth of the tun, when it is lengthwise hoisted up\nand down against a ship’s side.\n\nAs in decapitating the whale, the operator’s instrument is brought close to the\nspot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the spermaceti magazine; he\nhas, therefore, to be uncommonly heedful, lest a careless, untimely stroke\nshould invade the sanctuary and wastingly let out its invaluable contents. It is\nthis decapitated end of the head, also, which is at last elevated out of the\nwater, and retained in that position by the enormous cutting tackles, whose\nhempen combinations, on one side, make quite a wilderness of ropes in that\nquarter.\n\nThus much being said, attend now, I pray you, to that marvellous and—in this\nparticular instance—almost fatal operation whereby the Sperm Whale’s great\nHeidelburgh Tun is tapped.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 78. CISTERN AND BUCKETS.\n\nNimble as a cat, Tashtego mounts aloft; and without altering his erect posture,\nruns straight out upon the overhanging mainyard-arm, to the part where it\nexactly projects over the hoisted Tun. He has carried with him a light tackle\ncalled a whip, consisting of only two parts, travelling through a single-sheaved\nblock. Securing this block, so that it hangs down from the yard-arm, he swings\none end of the rope, till it is caught and firmly held by a hand on deck. Then,\nhand-over-hand, down the other part, the Indian drops through the air, till\ndexterously he lands on the summit of the head. There—still high elevated above\nthe rest of the company, to whom he vivaciously cries—he seems some Turkish\nMuezzin calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower. A\nshort-handled sharp spade being sent up to him, he diligently searches for the\nproper place to begin breaking into the Tun. In this business he proceeds very\nheedfully, like a treasure-hunter in some old house, sounding the walls to find\nwhere the gold is masoned in. By the time this cautious search is over, a stout\niron-bound bucket, precisely like a well-bucket, has been attached to one end of\nthe whip; while the other end, being stretched across the deck, is there held by\ntwo or three alert hands. These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the\nIndian, to whom another person has reached up a very long pole. Inserting this\npole into the bucket, Tashtego downward guides the bucket into the Tun, till it\nentirely disappears; then giving the word to the seamen at the whip, up comes\nthe bucket again, all bubbling like a dairy-maid’s pail of new milk. Carefully\nlowered from its height, the full-freighted vessel is caught by an appointed\nhand, and quickly emptied into a large tub. Then remounting aloft, it again goes\nthrough the same round until the deep cistern will yield no more. Towards the\nend, Tashtego has to ram his long pole harder and harder, and deeper and deeper\ninto the Tun, until some twenty feet of the pole have gone down.\n\nNow, the people of the Pequod had been baling some time in this way; several\ntubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm; when all at once a queer accident\nhappened. Whether it was that Tashtego, that wild Indian, was so heedless and\nreckless as to let go for a moment his one-handed hold on the great cabled\ntackles suspending the head; or whether the place where he stood was so\ntreacherous and oozy; or whether the Evil One himself would have it to fall out\nso, without stating his particular reasons; how it was exactly, there is no\ntelling now; but, on a sudden, as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came\nsuckingly up—my God! poor Tashtego—like the twin reciprocating bucket in a\nveritable well, dropped head-foremost down into this great Tun of Heidelburgh,\nand with a horrible oily gurgling, went clean out of sight!\n\n“Man overboard!” cried Daggoo, who amid the general consternation first came to\nhis senses. “Swing the bucket this way!” and putting one foot into it, so as the\nbetter to secure his slippery hand-hold on the whip itself, the hoisters ran him\nhigh up to the top of the head, almost before Tashtego could have reached its\ninterior bottom. Meantime, there was a terrible tumult. Looking over the side,\nthey saw the before lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface\nof the sea, as if that moment seized with some momentous idea; whereas it was\nonly the poor Indian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous\ndepth to which he had sunk.\n\nAt this instant, while Daggoo, on the summit of the head, was clearing the\nwhip—which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles—a sharp cracking\nnoise was heard; and to the unspeakable horror of all, one of the two enormous\nhooks suspending the head tore out, and with a vast vibration the enormous mass\nsideways swung, till the drunk ship reeled and shook as if smitten by an\niceberg. The one remaining hook, upon which the entire strain now depended,\nseemed every instant to be on the point of giving way; an event still more\nlikely from the violent motions of the head.\n\n“Come down, come down!” yelled the seamen to Daggoo, but with one hand holding\non to the heavy tackles, so that if the head should drop, he would still remain\nsuspended; the negro having cleared the foul line, rammed down the bucket into\nthe now collapsed well, meaning that the buried harpooneer should grasp it, and\nso be hoisted out.\n\n“In heaven’s name, man,” cried Stubb, “are you ramming home a cartridge\nthere?—Avast! How will that help him; jamming that iron-bound bucket on top of\nhis head? Avast, will ye!”\n\n“Stand clear of the tackle!” cried a voice like the bursting of a rocket.\n\nAlmost in the same instant, with a thunder-boom, the enormous mass dropped into\nthe sea, like Niagara’s Table-Rock into the whirlpool; the suddenly relieved\nhull rolled away from it, to far down her glittering copper; and all caught\ntheir breath, as half swinging—now over the sailors’ heads, and now over the\nwater—Daggoo, through a thick mist of spray, was dimly beheld clinging to the\npendulous tackles, while poor, buried-alive Tashtego was sinking utterly down to\nthe bottom of the sea! But hardly had the blinding vapor cleared away, when a\nnaked figure with a boarding-sword in his hand, was for one swift moment seen\nhovering over the bulwarks. The next, a loud splash announced that my brave\nQueequeg had dived to the rescue. One packed rush was made to the side, and\nevery eye counted every ripple, as moment followed moment, and no sign of either\nthe sinker or the diver could be seen. Some hands now jumped into a boat\nalongside, and pushed a little off from the ship.\n\n“Ha! ha!” cried Daggoo, all at once, from his now quiet, swinging perch\noverhead; and looking further off from the side, we saw an arm thrust upright\nfrom the blue waves; a sight strange to see, as an arm thrust forth from the\ngrass over a grave.\n\n“Both! both!—it is both!”—cried Daggoo again with a joyful shout; and soon\nafter, Queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand, and with the other\nclutching the long hair of the Indian. Drawn into the waiting boat, they were\nquickly brought to the deck; but Tashtego was long in coming to, and Queequeg\ndid not look very brisk.\n\nNow, how had this noble rescue been accomplished? Why, diving after the slowly\ndescending head, Queequeg with his keen sword had made side lunges near its\nbottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there; then dropping his sword, had thrust\nhis long arm far inwards and upwards, and so hauled out poor Tash by the head.\nHe averred, that upon first thrusting in for him, a leg was presented; but well\nknowing that that was not as it ought to be, and might occasion great\ntrouble;—he had thrust back the leg, and by a dexterous heave and toss, had\nwrought a somerset upon the Indian; so that with the next trial, he came forth\nin the good old way—head foremost. As for the great head itself, that was doing\nas well as could be expected.\n\nAnd thus, through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of Queequeg, the\ndeliverance, or rather, delivery of Tashtego, was successfully accomplished, in\nthe teeth, too, of the most untoward and apparently hopeless impediments; which\nis a lesson by no means to be forgotten. Midwifery should be taught in the same\ncourse with fencing and boxing, riding and rowing.\n\nI know that this queer adventure of the Gay-Header’s will be sure to seem\nincredible to some landsmen, though they themselves may have either seen or\nheard of some one’s falling into a cistern ashore; an accident which not seldom\nhappens, and with much less reason too than the Indian’s, considering the\nexceeding slipperiness of the curb of the Sperm Whale’s well.\n\nBut, peradventure, it may be sagaciously urged, how is this? We thought the\ntissued, infiltrated head of the Sperm Whale, was the lightest and most corky\npart about him; and yet thou makest it sink in an element of a far greater\nspecific gravity than itself. We have thee there. Not at all, but I have ye; for\nat the time poor Tash fell in, the case had been nearly emptied of its lighter\ncontents, leaving little but the dense tendinous wall of the well—a double\nwelded, hammered substance, as I have before said, much heavier than the sea\nwater, and a lump of which sinks in it like lead almost. But the tendency to\nrapid sinking in this substance was in the present instance materially\ncounteracted by the other parts of the head remaining undetached from it, so\nthat it sank very slowly and deliberately indeed, affording Queequeg a fair\nchance for performing his agile obstetrics on the run, as you may say. Yes, it\nwas a running delivery, so it was.\n\nNow, had Tashtego perished in that head, it had been a very precious perishing;\nsmothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant spermaceti; coffined,\nhearsed, and tombed in the secret inner chamber and sanctum sanctorum of the\nwhale. Only one sweeter end can readily be recalled—the delicious death of an\nOhio honey-hunter, who seeking honey in the crotch of a hollow tree, found such\nexceeding store of it, that leaning too far over, it sucked him in, so that he\ndied embalmed. How many, think ye, have likewise fallen into Plato’s honey head,\nand sweetly perished there?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 79. THE PRAIRIE.\n\nTo scan the lines of his face, or feel the bumps on the head of this Leviathan;\nthis is a thing which no Physiognomist or Phrenologist has as yet undertaken.\nSuch an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as for Lavater to have\nscrutinized the wrinkles on the Rock of Gibraltar, or for Gall to have mounted a\nladder and manipulated the Dome of the Pantheon. Still, in that famous work of\nhis, Lavater not only treats of the various faces of men, but also attentively\nstudies the faces of horses, birds, serpents, and fish; and dwells in detail\nupon the modifications of expression discernible therein. Nor have Gall and his\ndisciple Spurzheim failed to throw out some hints touching the phrenological\ncharacteristics of other beings than man. Therefore, though I am but ill\nqualified for a pioneer, in the application of these two semi-sciences to the\nwhale, I will do my endeavor. I try all things; I achieve what I can.\n\nPhysiognomically regarded, the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature. He has no\nproper nose. And since the nose is the central and most conspicuous of the\nfeatures; and since it perhaps most modifies and finally controls their combined\nexpression; hence it would seem that its entire absence, as an external\nappendage, must very largely affect the countenance of the whale. For as in\nlandscape gardening, a spire, cupola, monument, or tower of some sort, is deemed\nalmost indispensable to the completion of the scene; so no face can be\nphysiognomically in keeping without the elevated open-work belfry of the nose.\nDash the nose from Phidias’s marble Jove, and what a sorry remainder!\nNevertheless, Leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude, all his proportions are so\nstately, that the same deficiency which in the sculptured Jove were hideous, in\nhim is no blemish at all. Nay, it is an added grandeur. A nose to the whale\nwould have been impertinent. As on your physiognomical voyage you sail round his\nvast head in your jolly-boat, your noble conceptions of him are never insulted\nby the reflection that he has a nose to be pulled. A pestilent conceit, which so\noften will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the mightiest royal beadle\non his throne.\n\nIn some particulars, perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view to be had of\nthe Sperm Whale, is that of the full front of his head. This aspect is sublime.\n\nIn thought, a fine human brow is like the East when troubled with the morning.\nIn the repose of the pasture, the curled brow of the bull has a touch of the\ngrand in it. Pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles, the elephant’s brow is\nmajestic. Human or animal, the mystical brow is as that great golden seal\naffixed by the German emperors to their decrees. It signifies—“God: done this\nday by my hand.” But in most creatures, nay in man himself, very often the brow\nis but a mere strip of alpine land lying along the snow line. Few are the\nforeheads which like Shakespeare’s or Melancthon’s rise so high, and descend so\nlow, that the eyes themselves seem clear, eternal, tideless mountain lakes; and\nall above them in the forehead’s wrinkles, you seem to track the antlered\nthoughts descending there to drink, as the Highland hunters track the snow\nprints of the deer. But in the great Sperm Whale, this high and mighty god-like\ndignity inherent in the brow is so immensely amplified, that gazing on it, in\nthat full front view, you feel the Deity and the dread powers more forcibly than\nin beholding any other object in living nature. For you see no one point\nprecisely; not one distinct feature is revealed; no nose, eyes, ears, or mouth;\nno face; he has none, proper; nothing but that one broad firmament of a\nforehead, pleated with riddles; dumbly lowering with the doom of boats, and\nships, and men. Nor, in profile, does this wondrous brow diminish; though that\nway viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so. In profile, you plainly\nperceive that horizontal, semi-crescentic depression in the forehead’s middle,\nwhich, in man, is Lavater’s mark of genius.\n\nBut how? Genius in the Sperm Whale? Has the Sperm Whale ever written a book,\nspoken a speech? No, his great genius is declared in his doing nothing\nparticular to prove it. It is moreover declared in his pyramidical silence. And\nthis reminds me that had the great Sperm Whale been known to the young Orient\nWorld, he would have been deified by their child-magian thoughts. They deified\nthe crocodile of the Nile, because the crocodile is tongueless; and the Sperm\nWhale has no tongue, or at least it is so exceedingly small, as to be incapable\nof protrusion. If hereafter any highly cultured, poetical nation shall lure back\nto their birth-right, the merry May-day gods of old; and livingly enthrone them\nagain in the now egotistical sky; in the now unhaunted hill; then be sure,\nexalted to Jove’s high seat, the great Sperm Whale shall lord it.\n\nChampollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics. But there is no\nChampollion to decipher the Egypt of every man’s and every being’s face.\nPhysiognomy, like every other human science, is but a passing fable. If then,\nSir William Jones, who read in thirty languages, could not read the simplest\npeasant’s face in its profounder and more subtle meanings, how may unlettered\nIshmael hope to read the awful Chaldee of the Sperm Whale’s brow? I but put that\nbrow before you. Read it if you can.\n\n"},{"title":"Test Section Title","content":"THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OF MOBY DICK; OR, THE WHALE\n\nThis ebook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most other\nparts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever.

He was\never dusting his old lexicons and grammars, with a queer handkerchief, mockingly\nembellished with all the gay flags of all the known nations of the world. He\nloved to dust his old grammars; it somehow mildly reminded him of his mortality.\n\n“While you take in hand to school others, and to teach them by what name a\nwhale-fish is to be called in our tongue, leaving out, through ignorance, the\nletter H, which almost alone maketh up the signification of the word, you\ndeliver that which is not true.” —Hackluyt.\n\n“WHALE. * * * Sw. and Dan. hval. This animal is named from roundness or rolling;\nfor in Dan. hvalt is arched or vaulted.” —Webster’s Dictionary.\n\n“WHALE. * * * It is more immediately from the Dut. and Ger. Wallen; A.S.\nWalw-ian, to roll, to wallow.” —Richardson’s Dictionary.\n\nחו, Hebrew. ϰητος, Greek. CETUS, Latin. WHŒL, Anglo-Saxon. HVALT, Danish. WAL,\nDutch. HWAL, Swedish. HVALUR, Icelandic. WHALE, English. BALEINE, French.\nBALLENA, Spanish. PEKEE-NUEE-NUEE, Fegee. PEHEE-NUEE-NUEE, Erromangoan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXTRACTS. (SUPPLIED BY A SUB-SUB-LIBRARIAN).\n\nIt will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and grub-worm of a poor\ndevil of a Sub-Sub appears to have gone through the long Vaticans and\nstreet-stalls of the earth, picking up whatever random allusions to whales he\ncould anyways find in any book whatsoever, sacred or profane. Therefore you must\nnot, in every case at least, take the higgledy-piggledy whale statements,\nhowever authentic, in these extracts, for veritable gospel cetology. Far from\nit. As touching the ancient authors generally, as well as the poets here\nappearing, these extracts are solely valuable or entertaining, as affording a\nglancing bird’s eye view of what has been promiscuously said, thought, fancied,\nand sung of Leviathan, by many nations and generations, including our own.\n\nSo fare thee well, poor devil of a Sub-Sub, whose commentator I am. Thou\nbelongest to that hopeless, sallow tribe which no wine of this world will ever\nwarm; and for whom even Pale Sherry would be too rosy-strong; but with whom one\nsometimes loves to sit, and feel poor-devilish, too; and grow convivial upon\ntears; and say to them bluntly, with full eyes and empty glasses, and in not\naltogether unpleasant sadness—Give it up, Sub-Subs! For by how much the more\npains ye take to please the world, by so much the more shall ye for ever go\nthankless! Would that I could clear out Hampton Court and the Tuileries for ye!\nBut gulp down your tears and hie aloft to the royal-mast with your hearts; for\nyour friends who have gone before are clearing out the seven-storied heavens,\nand making refugees of long-pampered Gabriel, Michael, and Raphael, against your\ncoming. Here ye strike but splintered hearts together—there, ye shall strike\nunsplinterable glasses!\n\n\nEXTRACTS.\n\n“And God created great whales.” —Genesis.\n\n“Leviathan maketh a path to shine after him; One would think the deep to be\nhoary.” —Job.\n\n“Now the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah.” —Jonah.\n\n“There go the ships; there is that Leviathan whom thou hast made to play\ntherein.” —Psalms.\n\n“In that day, the Lord with his sore, and great, and strong sword, shall punish\nLeviathan the piercing serpent, even Leviathan that crooked serpent; and he\nshall slay the dragon that is in the sea.” —Isaiah.\n\n“And what thing soever besides cometh within the chaos of this monster’s mouth,\nbe it beast, boat, or stone, down it goes all incontinently that foul great\nswallow of his, and perisheth in the bottomless gulf of his paunch.” —Holland’s\nPlutarch’s Morals.\n\n“The Indian Sea breedeth the most and the biggest fishes that are: among which\nthe Whales and Whirlpooles called Balaene, take up as much in length as four\nacres or arpens of land.” —Holland’s Pliny.\n\n“Scarcely had we proceeded two days on the sea, when about sunrise a great many\nWhales and other monsters of the sea, appeared. Among the former, one was of a\nmost monstrous size.... This came towards us, open-mouthed, raising the waves on\nall sides, and beating the sea before him into a foam.” —Tooke’s Lucian. “The\nTrue History.”\n\n“He visited this country also with a view of catching horse-whales, which had\nbones of very great value for their teeth, of which he brought some to the\nking.... The best whales were catched in his own country, of which some were\nforty-eight, some fifty yards long.

LOOMINGS.\n\nCall me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or\nno money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought\nI would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I\nhave of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find\nmyself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in\nmy soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses,\nand bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my\nhypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to\nprevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking\npeople’s hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can.\nThis is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato\nthrows himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing\nsurprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some\ntime or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.\n\nThere now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as\nIndian isles by coral reefs—commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left,\nthe streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown is the battery, where that\nnoble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous\nwere out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.\n\nCircumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook to\nCoenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do you see?—Posted\nlike silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon thousands of\nmortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated\nupon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some\nhigh aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep.\nBut these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster—tied to\ncounters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green\nfields gone? What do they here?\n\nBut look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and seemingly\nbound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the extremest limit of\nthe land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice.\nNo. They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling\nin. And there they stand—miles of them—leagues. Inlanders all, they come from\nlanes and alleys, streets and avenues—north, east, south, and west. Yet here\nthey all unite. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the\ncompasses of all those ships attract them thither?\n\nOnce more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take almost\nany path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a dale, and leaves\nyou there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in it. Let the most\nabsent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries—stand that man on his\nlegs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water\nthere be in all that region. Should you ever be athirst in the great American\ndesert, try this experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a\nmetaphysical professor. Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded\nfor ever.\n\nBut here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest,\nquietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the\nSaco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his trees, each with a\nhollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and here sleeps his\nmeadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy\nsmoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping\nspurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side blue. But though the picture lies\nthus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon\nthis shepherd’s head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd’s eye were fixed\nupon the magic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June, when for scores\non scores of miles you wade knee-deep among Tiger-lilies—what is the one charm\nwanting?—Water—there is not a drop of water there! Were Niagara but a cataract\nof sand, would you travel your thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet\nof Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether\nto buy him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian\ntrip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust\nhealthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea? Why upon your\nfirst voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration,\nwhen first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land? Why did\nthe old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it a separate deity,\nand own brother of Jove? Surely all this is not without meaning. And still\ndeeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp\nthe tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was\ndrowned. But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is\nthe image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.\n\nNow, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin to grow\nhazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs, I do not mean\nto have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger. For to go as a\npassenger you must needs have a purse, and a purse is but a rag unless you have\nsomething in it. Besides, passengers get sea-sick—grow quarrelsome—don’t sleep\nof nights—do not enjoy themselves much, as a general thing;—no, I never go as a\npassenger; nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a\nCommodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction of such\noffices to those who like them. For my part, I abominate all honorable\nrespectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind whatsoever. It is\nquite as much as I can do to take care of myself, without taking care of ships,\nbarques, brigs, schooners, and what not. And as for going as cook,—though I\nconfess there is considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of officer on\nship-board—yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;—though once broiled,\njudiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who\nwill speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I\nwill. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis\nand roasted river horse, that you see the mummies of those creatures in their\nhuge bake-houses the pyramids.\n\nNo, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast, plumb down\ninto the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head. True, they rather order\nme about some, and make me jump from spar to spar, like a grasshopper in a May\nmeadow. And at first, this sort of thing is unpleasant enough. It touches one’s\nsense of honor, particularly if you come of an old established family in the\nland, the Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if\njust previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been lording it as\na country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in awe of you. The\ntransition is a keen one, I assure you, from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and\nrequires a strong decoction of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and\nbear it. But even this wears off in time.\n\nWhat of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom and\nsweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed, I mean, in\nthe scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel Gabriel thinks\nanything the less of me, because I promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks\nin that particular instance? Who ain’t a slave? Tell me that. Well, then,\nhowever the old sea-captains may order me about—however they may thump and punch\nme about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that\neverybody else is one way or other served in much the same way—either in a\nphysical or metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is\npassed round, and all hands should rub each other’s shoulder-blades, and be\ncontent.\n\nAgain, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of paying me\nfor my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that I ever\nheard of. On the contrary, passengers themselves must pay. And there is all the\ndifference in the world between paying and being paid. The act of paying is\nperhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed\nupon us. But being paid,—what will compare with it? The urbane activity with\nwhich a man receives money is really marvellous, considering that we so\nearnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no\naccount can a monied man enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we consign ourselves\nto perdition!\n\nFinally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome exercise and\npure air of the fore-castle deck. For as in this world, head winds are far more\nprevalent than winds from astern (that is, if you never violate the Pythagorean\nmaxim), so for the most part the Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his\natmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the forecastle. He thinks he\nbreathes it first; but not so. In much the same way do the commonalty lead their\nleaders in many other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect\nit. But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a\nmerchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage;\nthis the invisible police officer of the Fates, who has the constant\nsurveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in some\nunaccountable way—he can better answer than any one else. And, doubtless, my\ngoing on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grand programme of Providence\nthat was drawn up a long time ago. It came in as a sort of brief interlude and\nsolo between more extensive performances. I take it that this part of the bill\nmust have run something like this:\n\n“Grand Contested Election for the Presidency of the United States. “WHALING\nVOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL. “BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.”\n\nThough I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, the Fates,\nput me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when others were set down\nfor magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short and easy parts in genteel\ncomedies, and jolly parts in farces—though I cannot tell why this was exactly;\nyet, now that I recall all the circumstances, I think I can see a little into\nthe springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under various\ndisguises, induced me to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling\nme into the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased\nfreewill and discriminating judgment.\n\nChief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself.\nSuch a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity. Then the wild\nand distant seas where he rolled his island bulk; the undeliverable, nameless\nperils of the whale; these, with all the attending marvels of a thousand\nPatagonian sights and sounds, helped to sway me to my wish. With other men,\nperhaps, such things would not have been inducements; but as for me, I am\ntormented with an everlasting itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden\nseas, and land on barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to\nperceive a horror, and could still be social with it—would they let me—since it\nis but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place one lodges\nin.\n\nBy reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the great\nflood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild conceits that swayed\nme to my purpose, two and two there floated into my inmost soul, endless\nprocessions of the whale, and, mid most of them all, one grand hooded phantom,\nlike a snow hill in the air.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. THE CARPET-BAG.\n\nI stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my arm, and\nstarted for Cape Horn and the Pacific. Quitting the good city of old Manhatto, I\nduly arrived in New Bedford. It was a Saturday night in December. Much was I\ndisappointed upon learning that the little packet for Nantucket had already\nsailed, and that no way of reaching that place would offer, till the following\nMonday.\n\nAs most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at this\nsame New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as well be related\nthat I, for one, had no idea of so doing. For my mind was made up to sail in no\nother than a Nantucket craft, because there was a fine, boisterous something\nabout everything connected with that famous old island, which amazingly pleased\nme. Besides though New Bedford has of late been gradually monopolising the\nbusiness of whaling, and though in this matter poor old Nantucket is now much\nbehind her, yet Nantucket was her great original—the Tyre of this Carthage;—the\nplace where the first dead American whale was stranded. Where else but from\nNantucket did those aboriginal whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoes\nto give chase to the Leviathan? And where but from Nantucket, too, did that\nfirst adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with imported\ncobblestones—so goes the story—to throw at the whales, in order to discover when\nthey were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit?\n\nNow having a night, a day, and still another night following before me in New\nBedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a matter of\nconcernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile. It was a very\ndubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold and cheerless.\nI knew no one in the place. With anxious grapnels I had sounded my pocket, and\nonly brought up a few pieces of silver,—So, wherever you go, Ishmael, said I to\nmyself, as I stood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag, and\ncomparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness towards the\nsouth—wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the night, my dear\nIshmael, be sure to inquire the price, and don’t be too particular.\n\nWith halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of “The Crossed\nHarpoons”—but it looked too expensive and jolly there. Further on, from the\nbright red windows of the “Sword-Fish Inn,” there came such fervent rays, that\nit seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from before the house, for\neverywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic\npavement,—rather weary for me, when I struck my foot against the flinty\nprojections, because from hard, remorseless service the soles of my boots were\nin a most miserable plight. Too expensive and jolly, again thought I, pausing\none moment to watch the broad glare in the street, and hear the sounds of the\ntinkling glasses within. But go on, Ishmael, said I at last; don’t you hear? get\naway from before the door; your patched boots are stopping the way. So on I\nwent. I now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward, for there,\ndoubtless, were the cheapest, if not the cheeriest inns.\n\nSuch dreary streets! blocks of blackness, not houses, on either hand, and here\nand there a candle, like a candle moving about in a tomb. At this hour of the\nnight, of the last day of the week, that quarter of the town proved all but\ndeserted. But presently I came to a smoky light proceeding from a low, wide\nbuilding, the door of which stood invitingly open. It had a careless look, as if\nit were meant for the uses of the public; so, entering, the first thing I did\nwas to stumble over an ash-box in the porch. Ha! thought I, ha, as the flying\nparticles almost choked me, are these ashes from that destroyed city, Gomorrah?\nBut “The Crossed Harpoons,” and “The Sword-Fish?”—this, then must needs be the\nsign of “The Trap.” However, I picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within,\npushed on and opened a second, interior door.\n\nIt seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet. A hundred black faces\nturned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black Angel of Doom was\nbeating a book in a pulpit. It was a negro church; and the preacher’s text was\nabout the blackness of darkness, and the weeping and wailing and teeth-gnashing\nthere. Ha, Ishmael, muttered I, backing out, Wretched entertainment at the sign\nof ‘The Trap!’\n\nMoving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks, and\nheard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a swinging sign over\nthe door with a white painting upon it, faintly representing a tall straight jet\nof misty spray, and these words underneath—“The Spouter Inn:—Peter Coffin.”\n\nCoffin?—Spouter?—Rather ominous in that particular connexion, thought I. But it\nis a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I suppose this Peter here is an\nemigrant from there. As the light looked so dim, and the place, for the time,\nlooked quiet enough, and the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if\nit might have been carted here from the ruins of some burnt district, and as the\nswinging sign had a poverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought that here\nwas the very spot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea coffee.\n\nIt was a queer sort of place—a gable-ended old house, one side palsied as it\nwere, and leaning over sadly. It stood on a sharp bleak corner, where that\ntempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever it did about poor\nPaul’s tossed craft. Euroclydon, nevertheless, is a mighty pleasant zephyr to\nany one in-doors, with his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed. “In judging\nof that tempestuous wind called Euroclydon,” says an old writer—of whose works I\npossess the only copy extant—“it maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou\nlookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside, or\nwhether thou observest it from that sashless window, where the frost is on both\nsides, and of which the wight Death is the only glazier.” True enough, thought\nI, as this passage occurred to my mind—old black-letter, thou reasonest well.\nYes, these eyes are windows, and this body of mine is the house. What a pity\nthey didn’t stop up the chinks and the crannies though, and thrust in a little\nlint here and there. But it’s too late to make any improvements now. The\nuniverse is finished; the copestone is on, and the chips were carted off a\nmillion years ago. Poor Lazarus there, chattering his teeth against the\ncurbstone for his pillow, and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings, he\nmight plug up both ears with rags, and put a corn-cob into his mouth, and yet\nthat would not keep out the tempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon! says old Dives,\nin his red silken wrapper—(he had a redder one afterwards) pooh, pooh! What a\nfine frosty night; how Orion glitters; what northern lights! Let them talk of\ntheir oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories; give me the\nprivilege of making my own summer with my own coals.\n\nBut what thinks Lazarus? Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up to the\ngrand northern lights? Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra than here? Would\nhe not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the line of the equator; yea, ye\ngods! go down to the fiery pit itself, in order to keep out this frost?\n\nNow, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the door of\nDives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be moored to one of\nthe Moluccas. Yet Dives himself, he too lives like a Czar in an ice palace made\nof frozen sighs, and being a president of a temperance society, he only drinks\nthe tepid tears of orphans.\n\nBut no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and there is plenty\nof that yet to come. Let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet, and see what\nsort of a place this “Spouter” may be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. THE SPOUTER-INN.\n\nEntering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide, low,\nstraggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of the bulwarks of\nsome condemned old craft. On one side hung a very large oilpainting so\nthoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the unequal crosslights by\nwhich you viewed it, it was only by diligent study and a series of systematic\nvisits to it, and careful inquiry of the neighbors, that you could any way\narrive at an understanding of its purpose. Such unaccountable masses of shades\nand shadows, that at first you almost thought some ambitious young artist, in\nthe time of the New England hags, had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched.\nBut by dint of much and earnest contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and\nespecially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the entry, you\nat last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however wild, might not be\naltogether unwarranted.\n\nBut what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber, portentous, black\nmass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three blue, dim,\nperpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast. A boggy, soggy, squitchy\npicture truly, enough to drive a nervous man distracted. Yet was there a sort of\nindefinite, half-attained, unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you\nto it, till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what that\nmarvellous painting meant. Ever and anon a bright, but, alas, deceptive idea\nwould dart you through.—It’s the Black Sea in a midnight gale.—It’s the\nunnatural combat of the four primal elements.—It’s a blasted heath.—It’s a\nHyperborean winter scene.—It’s the breaking-up of the icebound stream of Time.\nBut at last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous something in the\npicture’s midst. That once found out, and all the rest were plain. But stop;\ndoes it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish? even the great\nleviathan himself?\n\nIn fact, the artist’s design seemed this: a final theory of my own, partly based\nupon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom I conversed upon the\nsubject. The picture represents a Cape-Horner in a great hurricane; the\nhalf-foundered ship weltering there with its three dismantled masts alone\nvisible; and an exasperated whale, purposing to spring clean over the craft, is\nin the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mast-heads.\n\nThe opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish array of\nmonstrous clubs and spears. Some were thickly set with glittering teeth\nresembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots of human hair; and one was\nsickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping round like the segment made in the\nnew-mown grass by a long-armed mower. You shuddered as you gazed, and wondered\nwhat monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have gone a death-harvesting with\nsuch a hacking, horrifying implement. Mixed with these were rusty old whaling\nlances and harpoons all broken and deformed. Some were storied weapons. With\nthis once long lance, now wildly elbowed, fifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill\nfifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset. And that harpoon—so like a\ncorkscrew now—was flung in Javan seas, and run away with by a whale, years\nafterwards slain off the Cape of Blanco. The original iron entered nigh the\ntail, and, like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man, travelled\nfull forty feet, and at last was found imbedded in the hump.\n\nCrossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched way—cut through what in\nold times must have been a great central chimney with fireplaces all round—you\nenter the public room. A still duskier place is this, with such low ponderous\nbeams above, and such old wrinkled planks beneath, that you would almost fancy\nyou trod some old craft’s cockpits, especially of such a howling night, when\nthis corner-anchored old ark rocked so furiously. On one side stood a long, low,\nshelf-like table covered with cracked glass cases, filled with dusty rarities\ngathered from this wide world’s remotest nooks. Projecting from the further\nangle of the room stands a dark-looking den—the bar—a rude attempt at a right\nwhale’s head. Be that how it may, there stands the vast arched bone of the\nwhale’s jaw, so wide, a coach might almost drive beneath it. Within are shabby\nshelves, ranged round with old decanters, bottles, flasks; and in those jaws of\nswift destruction, like another cursed Jonah (by which name indeed they called\nhim), bustles a little withered old man, who, for their money, dearly sells the\nsailors deliriums and death.\n\nAbominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison. Though true\ncylinders without—within, the villanous green goggling glasses deceitfully\ntapered downwards to a cheating bottom. Parallel meridians rudely pecked into\nthe glass, surround these footpads’ goblets. Fill to this mark, and your charge\nis but a penny; to this a penny more; and so on to the full glass—the Cape Horn\nmeasure, which you may gulp down for a shilling.\n\nUpon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered about a table,\nexamining by a dim light divers specimens of skrimshander. I sought the\nlandlord, and telling him I desired to be accommodated with a room, received for\nanswer that his house was full—not a bed unoccupied. “But avast,” he added,\ntapping his forehead, “you haint no objections to sharing a harpooneer’s\nblanket, have ye? I s’pose you are goin’ a-whalin’, so you’d better get used to\nthat sort of thing.”\n\nI told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should ever do\nso, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be, and that if he (the\nlandlord) really had no other place for me, and the harpooneer was not decidedly\nobjectionable, why rather than wander further about a strange town on so bitter\na night, I would put up with the half of any decent man’s blanket.\n\n“I thought so. All right; take a seat. Supper?—you want supper? Supper’ll be\nready directly.”\n\nI sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on the Battery.\nAt one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with his jack-knife,\nstooping over and diligently working away at the space between his legs. He was\ntrying his hand at a ship under full sail, but he didn’t make much headway, I\nthought.\n\nAt last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an adjoining room.\nIt was cold as Iceland—no fire at all—the landlord said he couldn’t afford it.\nNothing but two dismal tallow candles, each in a winding sheet. We were fain to\nbutton up our monkey jackets, and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our\nhalf frozen fingers. But the fare was of the most substantial kind—not only meat\nand potatoes, but dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for supper! One young\nfellow in a green box coat, addressed himself to these dumplings in a most\ndireful manner.\n\n“My boy,” said the landlord, “you’ll have the nightmare to a dead sartainty.”\n\n“Landlord,” I whispered, “that aint the harpooneer is it?”\n\n“Oh, no,” said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, “the harpooneer is a\ndark complexioned chap. He never eats dumplings, he don’t—he eats nothing but\nsteaks, and he likes ’em rare.”\n\n“The devil he does,” says I. “Where is that harpooneer? Is he here?”\n\n“He’ll be here afore long,” was the answer.\n\nI could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of this “dark complexioned”\nharpooneer. At any rate, I made up my mind that if it so turned out that we\nshould sleep together, he must undress and get into bed before I did.\n\nSupper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when, knowing not what else\nto do with myself, I resolved to spend the rest of the evening as a looker on.\n\nPresently a rioting noise was heard without. Starting up, the landlord cried,\n“That’s the Grampus’s crew. I seed her reported in the offing this morning; a\nthree years’ voyage, and a full ship. Hurrah, boys; now we’ll have the latest\nnews from the Feegees.”\n\nA tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung open, and in\nrolled a wild set of mariners enough. Enveloped in their shaggy watch coats, and\nwith their heads muffled in woollen comforters, all bedarned and ragged, and\ntheir beards stiff with icicles, they seemed an eruption of bears from Labrador.\nThey had just landed from their boat, and this was the first house they entered.\nNo wonder, then, that they made a straight wake for the whale’s mouth—the\nbar—when the wrinkled little old Jonah, there officiating, soon poured them out\nbrimmers all round. One complained of a bad cold in his head, upon which Jonah\nmixed him a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which he swore was a\nsovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never mind of how long\nstanding, or whether caught off the coast of Labrador, or on the weather side of\nan ice-island.\n\nThe liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does even with the\narrantest topers newly landed from sea, and they began capering about most\nobstreperously.\n\nI observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though he seemed\ndesirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own sober face, yet\nupon the whole he refrained from making as much noise as the rest. This man\ninterested me at once; and since the sea-gods had ordained that he should soon\nbecome my shipmate (though but a sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative\nis concerned), I will here venture upon a little description of him. He stood\nfull six feet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam. I\nhave seldom seen such brawn in a man. His face was deeply brown and burnt,\nmaking his white teeth dazzling by the contrast; while in the deep shadows of\nhis eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy. His\nvoice at once announced that he was a Southerner, and from his fine stature, I\nthought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the Alleghanian Ridge in\nVirginia. When the revelry of his companions had mounted to its height, this man\nslipped away unobserved, and I saw no more of him till he became my comrade on\nthe sea. In a few minutes, however, he was missed by his shipmates, and being,\nit seems, for some reason a huge favourite with them, they raised a cry of\n“Bulkington! Bulkington! where’s Bulkington?” and darted out of the house in\npursuit of him.\n\nIt was now about nine o’clock, and the room seeming almost supernaturally quiet\nafter these orgies, I began to congratulate myself upon a little plan that had\noccurred to me just previous to the entrance of the seamen.\n\nNo man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you would a good deal rather not\nsleep with your own brother. I don’t know how it is, but people like to be\nprivate when they are sleeping. And when it comes to sleeping with an unknown\nstranger, in a strange inn, in a strange town, and that stranger a harpooneer,\nthen your objections indefinitely multiply. Nor was there any earthly reason why\nI as a sailor should sleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors no\nmore sleep two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore. To be sure they\nall sleep together in one apartment, but you have your own hammock, and cover\nyourself with your own blanket, and sleep in your own skin.\n\nThe more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the thought of\nsleeping with him. It was fair to presume that being a harpooneer, his linen or\nwoollen, as the case might be, would not be of the tidiest, certainly none of\nthe finest. I began to twitch all over. Besides, it was getting late, and my\ndecent harpooneer ought to be home and going bedwards. Suppose now, he should\ntumble in upon me at midnight—how could I tell from what vile hole he had been\ncoming?\n\n“Landlord! I’ve changed my mind about that harpooneer.—I shan’t sleep with him.\nI’ll try the bench here.”\n\n“Just as you please; I’m sorry I can’t spare ye a tablecloth for a mattress, and\nit’s a plaguy rough board here”—feeling of the knots and notches. “But wait a\nbit, Skrimshander; I’ve got a carpenter’s plane there in the bar—wait, I say,\nand I’ll make ye snug enough.” So saying he procured the plane; and with his old\nsilk handkerchief first dusting the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my\nbed, the while grinning like an ape. The shavings flew right and left; till at\nlast the plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot. The landlord was\nnear spraining his wrist, and I told him for heaven’s sake to quit—the bed was\nsoft enough to suit me, and I did not know how all the planing in the world\ncould make eider down of a pine plank. So gathering up the shavings with another\ngrin, and throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room, he went\nabout his business, and left me in a brown study.\n\nI now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too short; but\nthat could be mended with a chair. But it was a foot too narrow, and the other\nbench in the room was about four inches higher than the planed one—so there was\nno yoking them. I then placed the first bench lengthwise along the only clear\nspace against the wall, leaving a little interval between, for my back to settle\ndown in. But I soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me\nfrom under the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at all,\nespecially as another current from the rickety door met the one from the window,\nand both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity\nof the spot where I had thought to spend the night.\n\nThe devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn’t I steal a march\non him—bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed, not to be wakened by the\nmost violent knockings? It seemed no bad idea; but upon second thoughts I\ndismissed it. For who could tell but what the next morning, so soon as I popped\nout of the room, the harpooneer might be standing in the entry, all ready to\nknock me down!\n\nStill, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of spending a\nsufferable night unless in some other person’s bed, I began to think that after\nall I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against this unknown\nharpooneer. Thinks I, I’ll wait awhile; he must be dropping in before long. I’ll\nhave a good look at him then, and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows\nafter all—there’s no telling.\n\nBut though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and threes, and\ngoing to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.\n\n“Landlord!” said I, “what sort of a chap is he—does he always keep such late\nhours?” It was now hard upon twelve o’clock.\n\nThe landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be mightily\ntickled at something beyond my comprehension. “No,” he answered, “generally he’s\nan early bird—airley to bed and airley to rise—yes, he’s the bird what catches\nthe worm. But to-night he went out a peddling, you see, and I don’t see what on\nairth keeps him so late, unless, may be, he can’t sell his head.”\n\n“Can’t sell his head?—What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are telling\nme?” getting into a towering rage. “Do you pretend to say, landlord, that this\nharpooneer is actually engaged this blessed Saturday night, or rather Sunday\nmorning, in peddling his head around this town?”\n\n“That’s precisely it,” said the landlord, “and I told him he couldn’t sell it\nhere, the market’s overstocked.”\n\n“With what?” shouted I.\n\n“With heads to be sure; ain’t there too many heads in the world?”\n\n“I tell you what it is, landlord,” said I quite calmly, “you’d better stop\nspinning that yarn to me—I’m not green.”\n\n“May be not,” taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, “but I rayther guess\nyou’ll be done brown if that ere harpooneer hears you a slanderin’ his head.”\n\n“I’ll break it for him,” said I, now flying into a passion again at this\nunaccountable farrago of the landlord’s.\n\n“It’s broke a’ready,” said he.\n\n“Broke,” said I—“broke, do you mean?”\n\n“Sartain, and that’s the very reason he can’t sell it, I guess.”\n\n“Landlord,” said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a\nsnow-storm—“landlord, stop whittling. You and I must understand one another, and\nthat too without delay. I come to your house and want a bed; you tell me you can\nonly give me half a one; that the other half belongs to a certain harpooneer.\nAnd about this harpooneer, whom I have not yet seen, you persist in telling me\nthe most mystifying and exasperating stories tending to beget in me an\nuncomfortable feeling towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow—a sort of\nconnexion, landlord, which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest\ndegree. I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this\nharpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all respects safe to spend the night\nwith him. And in the first place, you will be so good as to unsay that story\nabout selling his head, which if true I take to be good evidence that this\nharpooneer is stark mad, and I’ve no idea of sleeping with a madman; and you,\nsir, you I mean, landlord, you, sir, by trying to induce me to do so knowingly,\nwould thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution.”\n\n“Wall,” said the landlord, fetching a long breath, “that’s a purty long sarmon\nfor a chap that rips a little now and then. But be easy, be easy, this here\nharpooneer I have been tellin’ you of has just arrived from the south seas,\nwhere he bought up a lot of ’balmed New Zealand heads (great curios, you know),\nand he’s sold all on ’em but one, and that one he’s trying to sell to-night,\ncause to-morrow’s Sunday, and it would not do to be sellin’ human heads about\nthe streets when folks is goin’ to churches. He wanted to, last Sunday, but I\nstopped him just as he was goin’ out of the door with four heads strung on a\nstring, for all the airth like a string of inions.”\n\nThis account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and showed that the\nlandlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling me—but at the same time what\ncould I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a Saturday night clean into the\nholy Sabbath, engaged in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead\nidolators?\n\n“Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man.”\n\n“He pays reg’lar,” was the rejoinder. “But come, it’s getting dreadful late, you\nhad better be turning flukes—it’s a nice bed; Sal and me slept in that ere bed\nthe night we were spliced. There’s plenty of room for two to kick about in that\nbed; it’s an almighty big bed that. Why, afore we give it up, Sal used to put\nour Sam and little Johnny in the foot of it. But I got a dreaming and sprawling\nabout one night, and somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came near\nbreaking his arm. Arter that, Sal said it wouldn’t do. Come along here, I’ll\ngive ye a glim in a jiffy;” and so saying he lighted a candle and held it\ntowards me, offering to lead the way. But I stood irresolute; when looking at a\nclock in the corner, he exclaimed “I vum it’s Sunday—you won’t see that\nharpooneer to-night; he’s come to anchor somewhere—come along then; do come;\nwon’t ye come?”\n\nI considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I was ushered\ninto a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough, with a prodigious\nbed, almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers to sleep abreast.\n\n“There,” said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest that did\ndouble duty as a wash-stand and centre table; “there, make yourself comfortable\nnow, and good night to ye.” I turned round from eyeing the bed, but he had\ndisappeared.\n\nFolding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed. Though none of the most\nelegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well. I then glanced round the\nroom; and besides the bedstead and centre table, could see no other furniture\nbelonging to the place, but a rude shelf, the four walls, and a papered\nfireboard representing a man striking a whale. Of things not properly belonging\nto the room, there was a hammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one\ncorner; also a large seaman’s bag, containing the harpooneer’s wardrobe, no\ndoubt in lieu of a land trunk. Likewise, there was a parcel of outlandish bone\nfish hooks on the shelf over the fire-place, and a tall harpoon standing at the\nhead of the bed.\n\nBut what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to the light, and\nfelt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to arrive at some\nsatisfactory conclusion concerning it. I can compare it to nothing but a large\ndoor mat, ornamented at the edges with little tinkling tags something like the\nstained porcupine quills round an Indian moccasin. There was a hole or slit in\nthe middle of this mat, as you see the same in South American ponchos. But could\nit be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat, and parade\nthe streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise? I put it on, to try it,\nand it weighed me down like a hamper, being uncommonly shaggy and thick, and I\nthought a little damp, as though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it\nof a rainy day. I went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I\nnever saw such a sight in my life. I tore myself out of it in such a hurry that\nI gave myself a kink in the neck.\n\nI sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this\nhead-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat. After thinking some time on the\nbed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then stood in the middle\nof the room thinking. I then took off my coat, and thought a little more in my\nshirt sleeves. But beginning to feel very cold now, half undressed as I was, and\nremembering what the landlord said about the harpooneer’s not coming home at all\nthat night, it being so very late, I made no more ado, but jumped out of my\npantaloons and boots, and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed, and\ncommended myself to the care of heaven.\n\nWhether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery, there is no\ntelling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not sleep for a long time. At\nlast I slid off into a light doze, and had pretty nearly made a good offing\ntowards the land of Nod, when I heard a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a\nglimmer of light come into the room from under the door.\n\nLord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal head-peddler.\nBut I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a word till spoken to.\nHolding a light in one hand, and that identical New Zealand head in the other,\nthe stranger entered the room, and without looking towards the bed, placed his\ncandle a good way off from me on the floor in one corner, and then began working\naway at the knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the\nroom. I was all eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted for some time\nwhile employed in unlacing the bag’s mouth. This accomplished, however, he\nturned round—when, good heavens! what a sight! Such a face! It was of a dark,\npurplish, yellow colour, here and there stuck over with large blackish looking\nsquares. Yes, it’s just as I thought, he’s a terrible bedfellow; he’s been in a\nfight, got dreadfully cut, and here he is, just from the surgeon. But at that\nmoment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light, that I plainly saw they\ncould not be sticking-plasters at all, those black squares on his cheeks. They\nwere stains of some sort or other. At first I knew not what to make of this; but\nsoon an inkling of the truth occurred to me. I remembered a story of a white\nman—a whaleman too—who, falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by them.\nI concluded that this harpooneer, in the course of his distant voyages, must\nhave met with a similar adventure. And what is it, thought I, after all! It’s\nonly his outside; a man can be honest in any sort of skin. But then, what to\nmake of his unearthly complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about,\nand completely independent of the squares of tattooing. To be sure, it might be\nnothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never heard of a hot sun’s\ntanning a white man into a purplish yellow one. However, I had never been in the\nSouth Seas; and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effects upon\nthe skin. Now, while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning,\nthis harpooneer never noticed me at all. But, after some difficulty having\nopened his bag, he commenced fumbling in it, and presently pulled out a sort of\ntomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing these on the old\nchest in the middle of the room, he then took the New Zealand head—a ghastly\nthing enough—and crammed it down into the bag. He now took off his hat—a new\nbeaver hat—when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise. There was no hair\non his head—none to speak of at least—nothing but a small scalp-knot twisted up\non his forehead. His bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a\nmildewed skull. Had not the stranger stood between me and the door, I would have\nbolted out of it quicker than ever I bolted a dinner.\n\nEven as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window, but it was\nthe second floor back. I am no coward, but what to make of this head-peddling\npurple rascal altogether passed my comprehension. Ignorance is the parent of\nfear, and being completely nonplussed and confounded about the stranger, I\nconfess I was now as much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had\nthus broken into my room at the dead of night. In fact, I was so afraid of him\nthat I was not game enough just then to address him, and demand a satisfactory\nanswer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him.\n\nMeanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last showed his chest\nand arms. As I live, these covered parts of him were checkered with the same\nsquares as his face; his back, too, was all over the same dark squares; he\nseemed to have been in a Thirty Years’ War, and just escaped from it with a\nsticking-plaster shirt. Still more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of\ndark green frogs were running up the trunks of young palms. It was now quite\nplain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a\nwhaleman in the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian country. I quaked to\nthink of it. A peddler of heads too—perhaps the heads of his own brothers. He\nmight take a fancy to mine—heavens! look at that tomahawk!\n\nBut there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about something\nthat completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me that he must indeed be\na heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall, or dreadnaught, which he had\npreviously hung on a chair, he fumbled in the pockets, and produced at length a\ncurious little deformed image with a hunch on its back, and exactly the colour\nof a three days’ old Congo baby. Remembering the embalmed head, at first I\nalmost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar\nmanner. But seeing that it was not at all limber, and that it glistened a good\ndeal like polished ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol,\nwhich indeed it proved to be. For now the savage goes up to the empty\nfire-place, and removing the papered fire-board, sets up this little\nhunch-backed image, like a tenpin, between the andirons. The chimney jambs and\nall the bricks inside were very sooty, so that I thought this fire-place made a\nvery appropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol.\n\nI now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but ill at\nease meantime—to see what was next to follow. First he takes about a double\nhandful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places them carefully before\nthe idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top and applying the flame from\nthe lamp, he kindled the shavings into a sacrificial blaze. Presently, after\nmany hasty snatches into the fire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers\n(whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing\nout the biscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite\noffer of it to the little negro. But the little devil did not seem to fancy such\ndry sort of fare at all; he never moved his lips. All these strange antics were\naccompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the devotee, who seemed to be\npraying in a sing-song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other, during\nwhich his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner. At last\nextinguishing the fire, he took the idol up very unceremoniously, and bagged it\nagain in his grego pocket as carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead\nwoodcock.\n\nAll these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and seeing him now\nexhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business operations, and jumping\ninto bed with me, I thought it was high time, now or never, before the light was\nput out, to break the spell in which I had so long been bound.\n\nBut the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal one. Taking up\nhis tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of it for an instant, and then\nholding it to the light, with his mouth at the handle, he puffed out great\nclouds of tobacco smoke. The next moment the light was extinguished, and this\nwild cannibal, tomahawk between his teeth, sprang into bed with me. I sang out,\nI could not help it now; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began\nfeeling me.\n\nStammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him against the\nwall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might be, to keep quiet, and\nlet me get up and light the lamp again. But his guttural responses satisfied me\nat once that he but ill comprehended my meaning.\n\n“Who-e debel you?”—he at last said—“you no speak-e, dam-me, I kill-e.” And so\nsaying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the dark.\n\n“Landlord, for God’s sake, Peter Coffin!” shouted I. “Landlord! Watch! Coffin!\nAngels! save me!”\n\n“Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!” again growled the\ncannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the hot\ntobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on fire. But thank\nheaven, at that moment the landlord came into the room light in hand, and\nleaping from the bed I ran up to him.\n\n“Don’t be afraid now,” said he, grinning again, “Queequeg here wouldn’t harm a\nhair of your head.”\n\n“Stop your grinning,” shouted I, “and why didn’t you tell me that that infernal\nharpooneer was a cannibal?”\n\n“I thought ye know’d it;—didn’t I tell ye, he was a peddlin’ heads around\ntown?—but turn flukes again and go to sleep. Queequeg, look here—you sabbee me,\nI sabbee—you this man sleepe you—you sabbee?”\n\n“Me sabbee plenty”—grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his pipe and sitting up in\nbed.\n\n“You gettee in,” he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and throwing the\nclothes to one side. He really did this in not only a civil but a really kind\nand charitable way. I stood looking at him a moment. For all his tattooings he\nwas on the whole a clean, comely looking cannibal. What’s all this fuss I have\nbeen making about, thought I to myself—the man’s a human being just as I am: he\nhas just as much reason to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him. Better sleep\nwith a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.\n\n“Landlord,” said I, “tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe, or whatever\nyou call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I will turn in with him.\nBut I don’t fancy having a man smoking in bed with me. It’s dangerous. Besides,\nI ain’t insured.”\n\nThis being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely motioned me\nto get into bed—rolling over to one side as much as to say—“I won’t touch a leg\nof ye.”\n\n“Good night, landlord,” said I, “you may go.”\n\nI turned in, and never slept better in my life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. THE COUNTERPANE.\n\nUpon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg’s arm thrown over me\nin the most loving and affectionate manner. You had almost thought I had been\nhis wife. The counterpane was of patchwork, full of odd little parti-coloured\nsquares and triangles; and this arm of his tattooed all over with an\ninterminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure, no two parts of which were of one\nprecise shade—owing I suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in\nsun and shade, his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times—this\nsame arm of his, I say, looked for all the world like a strip of that same\npatchwork quilt. Indeed, partly lying on it as the arm did when I first awoke, I\ncould hardly tell it from the quilt, they so blended their hues together; and it\nwas only by the sense of weight and pressure that I could tell that Queequeg was\nhugging me.\n\nMy sensations were strange. Let me try to explain them. When I was a child, I\nwell remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me; whether it was a\nreality or a dream, I never could entirely settle. The circumstance was this. I\nhad been cutting up some caper or other—I think it was trying to crawl up the\nchimney, as I had seen a little sweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother\nwho, somehow or other, was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed\nsupperless,—my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me\noff to bed, though it was only two o’clock in the afternoon of the 21st June,\nthe longest day in the year in our hemisphere. I felt dreadfully. But there was\nno help for it, so up stairs I went to my little room in the third floor,\nundressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time, and with a bitter\nsigh got between the sheets.\n\nI lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse before I\ncould hope for a resurrection. Sixteen hours in bed! the small of my back ached\nto think of it. And it was so light too; the sun shining in at the window, and a\ngreat rattling of coaches in the streets, and the sound of gay voices all over\nthe house. I felt worse and worse—at last I got up, dressed, and softly going\ndown in my stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw myself\nat her feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good slippering\nfor my misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning me to lie abed such an\nunendurable length of time. But she was the best and most conscientious of\nstepmothers, and back I had to go to my room. For several hours I lay there\nbroad awake, feeling a great deal worse than I have ever done since, even from\nthe greatest subsequent misfortunes. At last I must have fallen into a troubled\nnightmare of a doze; and slowly waking from it—half steeped in dreams—I opened\nmy eyes, and the before sun-lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness.\nInstantly I felt a shock running through all my frame; nothing was to be seen,\nand nothing was to be heard; but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine. My\narm hung over the counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable, silent form or\nphantom, to which the hand belonged, seemed closely seated by my bed-side. For\nwhat seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there, frozen with the most awful fears,\nnot daring to drag away my hand; yet ever thinking that if I could but stir it\none single inch, the horrid spell would be broken. I knew not how this\nconsciousness at last glided away from me; but waking in the morning, I\nshudderingly remembered it all, and for days and weeks and months afterwards I\nlost myself in confounding attempts to explain the mystery. Nay, to this very\nhour, I often puzzle myself with it.\n\nNow, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the supernatural\nhand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness, to those which I\nexperienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg’s pagan arm thrown round me. But at\nlength all the past night’s events soberly recurred, one by one, in fixed\nreality, and then I lay only alive to the comical predicament. For though I\ntried to move his arm—unlock his bridegroom clasp—yet, sleeping as he was, he\nstill hugged me tightly, as though naught but death should part us twain. I now\nstrove to rouse him—“Queequeg!”—but his only answer was a snore. I then rolled\nover, my neck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar; and suddenly felt a\nslight scratch. Throwing aside the counterpane, there lay the tomahawk sleeping\nby the savage’s side, as if it were a hatchet-faced baby. A pretty pickle,\ntruly, thought I; abed here in a strange house in the broad day, with a cannibal\nand a tomahawk! “Queequeg!—in the name of goodness, Queequeg, wake!” At length,\nby dint of much wriggling, and loud and incessant expostulations upon the\nunbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style, I\nsucceeded in extracting a grunt; and presently, he drew back his arm, shook\nhimself all over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in bed,\nstiff as a pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if he did not\naltogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim consciousness of\nknowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over him. Meanwhile, I lay\nquietly eyeing him, having no serious misgivings now, and bent upon narrowly\nobserving so curious a creature. When, at last, his mind seemed made up touching\nthe character of his bedfellow, and he became, as it were, reconciled to the\nfact; he jumped out upon the floor, and by certain signs and sounds gave me to\nunderstand that, if it pleased me, he would dress first and then leave me to\ndress afterwards, leaving the whole apartment to myself. Thinks I, Queequeg,\nunder the circumstances, this is a very civilized overture; but, the truth is,\nthese savages have an innate sense of delicacy, say what you will; it is\nmarvellous how essentially polite they are. I pay this particular compliment to\nQueequeg, because he treated me with so much civility and consideration, while I\nwas guilty of great rudeness; staring at him from the bed, and watching all his\ntoilette motions; for the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding.\nNevertheless, a man like Queequeg you don’t see every day, he and his ways were\nwell worth unusual regarding.\n\nHe commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall one, by the\nby, and then—still minus his trowsers—he hunted up his boots. What under the\nheavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his next movement was to crush\nhimself—boots in hand, and hat on—under the bed; when, from sundry violent\ngaspings and strainings, I inferred he was hard at work booting himself; though\nby no law of propriety that I ever heard of, is any man required to be private\nwhen putting on his boots. But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature in the\ntransition stage—neither caterpillar nor butterfly. He was just enough civilized\nto show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners. His education\nwas not yet completed. He was an undergraduate. If he had not been a small\ndegree civilized, he very probably would not have troubled himself with boots at\nall; but then, if he had not been still a savage, he never would have dreamt of\ngetting under the bed to put them on. At last, he emerged with his hat very much\ndented and crushed down over his eyes, and began creaking and limping about the\nroom, as if, not being much accustomed to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled\ncowhide ones—probably not made to order either—rather pinched and tormented him\nat the first go off of a bitter cold morning.\n\nSeeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the street\nbeing very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view into the room, and\nobserving more and more the indecorous figure that Queequeg made, staving about\nwith little else but his hat and boots on; I begged him as well as I could, to\naccelerate his toilet somewhat, and particularly to get into his pantaloons as\nsoon as possible. He complied, and then proceeded to wash himself. At that time\nin the morning any Christian would have washed his face; but Queequeg, to my\namazement, contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his chest, arms,\nand hands. He then donned his waistcoat, and taking up a piece of hard soap on\nthe wash-stand centre table, dipped it into water and commenced lathering his\nface. I was watching to see where he kept his razor, when lo and behold, he\ntakes the harpoon from the bed corner, slips out the long wooden stock,\nunsheathes the head, whets it a little on his boot, and striding up to the bit\nof mirror against the wall, begins a vigorous scraping, or rather harpooning of\nhis cheeks. Thinks I, Queequeg, this is using Rogers’s best cutlery with a\nvengeance. Afterwards I wondered the less at this operation when I came to know\nof what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how exceedingly sharp the\nlong straight edges are always kept.\n\nThe rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out of the\nroom, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and sporting his harpoon like\na marshal’s baton.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. BREAKFAST.\n\nI quickly followed suit, and descending into the bar-room accosted the grinning\nlandlord very pleasantly. I cherished no malice towards him, though he had been\nskylarking with me not a little in the matter of my bedfellow.\n\nHowever, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather too scarce a good\nthing; the more’s the pity. So, if any one man, in his own proper person, afford\nstuff for a good joke to anybody, let him not be backward, but let him\ncheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in that way. And the man that has\nanything bountifully laughable about him, be sure there is more in that man than\nyou perhaps think for.\n\nThe bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the night\nprevious, and whom I had not as yet had a good look at. They were nearly all\nwhalemen; chief mates, and second mates, and third mates, and sea carpenters,\nand sea coopers, and sea blacksmiths, and harpooneers, and ship keepers; a brown\nand brawny company, with bosky beards; an unshorn, shaggy set, all wearing\nmonkey jackets for morning gowns.\n\nYou could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore. This young\nfellow’s healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue, and would seem to\nsmell almost as musky; he cannot have been three days landed from his Indian\nvoyage. That man next him looks a few shades lighter; you might say a touch of\nsatin wood is in him. In the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn,\nbut slightly bleached withal; he doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore. But\nwho could show a cheek like Queequeg? which, barred with various tints, seemed\nlike the Andes’ western slope, to show forth in one array, contrasting climates,\nzone by zone.\n\n“Grub, ho!” now cried the landlord, flinging open a door, and in we went to\nbreakfast.\n\nThey say that men who have seen the world, thereby become quite at ease in\nmanner, quite self-possessed in company. Not always, though: Ledyard, the great\nNew England traveller, and Mungo Park, the Scotch one; of all men, they\npossessed the least assurance in the parlor. But perhaps the mere crossing of\nSiberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as Ledyard did, or the taking a long solitary\nwalk on an empty stomach, in the negro heart of Africa, which was the sum of\npoor Mungo’s performances—this kind of travel, I say, may not be the very best\nmode of attaining a high social polish. Still, for the most part, that sort of\nthing is to be had anywhere.\n\nThese reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that after we\nwere all seated at the table, and I was preparing to hear some good stories\nabout whaling; to my no small surprise, nearly every man maintained a profound\nsilence. And not only that, but they looked embarrassed. Yes, here were a set of\nsea-dogs, many of whom without the slightest bashfulness had boarded great\nwhales on the high seas—entire strangers to them—and duelled them dead without\nwinking; and yet, here they sat at a social breakfast table—all of the same\ncalling, all of kindred tastes—looking round as sheepishly at each other as\nthough they had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the Green\nMountains. A curious sight; these bashful bears, these timid warrior whalemen!\n\nBut as for Queequeg—why, Queequeg sat there among them—at the head of the table,\ntoo, it so chanced; as cool as an icicle. To be sure I cannot say much for his\nbreeding. His greatest admirer could not have cordially justified his bringing\nhis harpoon into breakfast with him, and using it there without ceremony;\nreaching over the table with it, to the imminent jeopardy of many heads, and\ngrappling the beefsteaks towards him. But that was certainly very coolly done by\nhim, and every one knows that in most people’s estimation, to do anything coolly\nis to do it genteelly.\n\nWe will not speak of all Queequeg’s peculiarities here; how he eschewed coffee\nand hot rolls, and applied his undivided attention to beefsteaks, done rare.\nEnough, that when breakfast was over he withdrew like the rest into the public\nroom, lighted his tomahawk-pipe, and was sitting there quietly digesting and\nsmoking with his inseparable hat on, when I sallied out for a stroll.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6. THE STREET.\n\nIf I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish an\nindividual as Queequeg circulating among the polite society of a civilized town,\nthat astonishment soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll through the\nstreets of New Bedford.\n\nIn thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable seaport will frequently offer\nto view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign parts. Even in Broadway\nand Chestnut streets, Mediterranean mariners will sometimes jostle the\naffrighted ladies. Regent Street is not unknown to Lascars and Malays; and at\nBombay, in the Apollo Green, live Yankees have often scared the natives. But New\nBedford beats all Water Street and Wapping. In these last-mentioned haunts you\nsee only sailors; but in New Bedford, actual cannibals stand chatting at street\ncorners; savages outright; many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy flesh.\nIt makes a stranger stare.\n\nBut, besides the Feegeeans, Tongatobooarrs, Erromanggoans, Pannangians, and\nBrighggians, and, besides the wild specimens of the whaling-craft which unheeded\nreel about the streets, you will see other sights still more curious, certainly\nmore comical. There weekly arrive in this town scores of green Vermonters and\nNew Hampshire men, all athirst for gain and glory in the fishery. They are\nmostly young, of stalwart frames; fellows who have felled forests, and now seek\nto drop the axe and snatch the whale-lance. Many are as green as the Green\nMountains whence they came. In some things you would think them but a few hours\nold. Look there! that chap strutting round the corner. He wears a beaver hat and\nswallow-tailed coat, girdled with a sailor-belt and sheath-knife. Here comes\nanother with a sou’-wester and a bombazine cloak.\n\nNo town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred one—I mean a downright\nbumpkin dandy—a fellow that, in the dog-days, will mow his two acres in buckskin\ngloves for fear of tanning his hands. Now when a country dandy like this takes\nit into his head to make a distinguished reputation, and joins the great\nwhale-fishery, you should see the comical things he does upon reaching the\nseaport. In bespeaking his sea-outfit, he orders bell-buttons to his waistcoats;\nstraps to his canvas trowsers. Ah, poor Hay-Seed! how bitterly will burst those\nstraps in the first howling gale, when thou art driven, straps, buttons, and\nall, down the throat of the tempest.\n\nBut think not that this famous town has only harpooneers, cannibals, and\nbumpkins to show her visitors. Not at all. Still New Bedford is a queer place.\nHad it not been for us whalemen, that tract of land would this day perhaps have\nbeen in as howling condition as the coast of Labrador. As it is, parts of her\nback country are enough to frighten one, they look so bony. The town itself is\nperhaps the dearest place to live in, in all New England. It is a land of oil,\ntrue enough: but not like Canaan; a land, also, of corn and wine. The streets do\nnot run with milk; nor in the spring-time do they pave them with fresh eggs.\nYet, in spite of this, nowhere in all America will you find more patrician-like\nhouses; parks and gardens more opulent, than in New Bedford. Whence came they?\nhow planted upon this once scraggy scoria of a country?\n\nGo and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty mansion, and\nyour question will be answered. Yes; all these brave houses and flowery gardens\ncame from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans. One and all, they were\nharpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom of the sea. Can Herr Alexander\nperform a feat like that?\n\nIn New Bedford, fathers, they say, give whales for dowers to their daughters,\nand portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a-piece. You must go to New\nBedford to see a brilliant wedding; for, they say, they have reservoirs of oil\nin every house, and every night recklessly burn their lengths in spermaceti\ncandles.\n\nIn summer time, the town is sweet to see; full of fine maples—long avenues of\ngreen and gold. And in August, high in air, the beautiful and bountiful\nhorse-chestnuts, candelabra-wise, proffer the passer-by their tapering upright\ncones of congregated blossoms. So omnipotent is art; which in many a district of\nNew Bedford has superinduced bright terraces of flowers upon the barren refuse\nrocks thrown aside at creation’s final day.\n\nAnd the women of New Bedford, they bloom like their own red roses. But roses\nonly bloom in summer; whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks is perennial as\nsunlight in the seventh heavens. Elsewhere match that bloom of theirs, ye\ncannot, save in Salem, where they tell me the young girls breathe such musk,\ntheir sailor sweethearts smell them miles off shore, as though they were drawing\nnigh the odorous Moluccas instead of the Puritanic sands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7. THE CHAPEL.\n\nIn this same New Bedford there stands a Whaleman’s Chapel, and few are the moody\nfishermen, shortly bound for the Indian Ocean or Pacific, who fail to make a\nSunday visit to the spot. I am sure that I did not.\n\nReturning from my first morning stroll, I again sallied out upon this special\nerrand. The sky had changed from clear, sunny cold, to driving sleet and mist.\nWrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called bearskin, I fought my\nway against the stubborn storm. Entering, I found a small scattered congregation\nof sailors, and sailors’ wives and widows. A muffled silence reigned, only\nbroken at times by the shrieks of the storm. Each silent worshipper seemed\npurposely sitting apart from the other, as if each silent grief were insular and\nincommunicable. The chaplain had not yet arrived; and there these silent islands\nof men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets, with black\nborders, masoned into the wall on either side the pulpit. Three of them ran\nsomething like the following, but I do not pretend to quote:—\n\nSACRED TO THE MEMORY OF JOHN TALBOT, Who, at the age of eighteen, was lost\noverboard, Near the Isle of Desolation, off Patagonia, November 1st, 1836. THIS\nTABLET Is erected to his Memory BY HIS SISTER.\n\nSACRED TO THE MEMORY OF ROBERT LONG, WILLIS ELLERY, NATHAN COLEMAN, WALTER\nCANNY, SETH MACY, AND SAMUEL GLEIG, Forming one of the boats’ crews OF THE SHIP\nELIZA Who were towed out of sight by a Whale, On the Off-shore Ground in the\nPACIFIC, December 31st, 1839. THIS MARBLE Is here placed by their surviving\nSHIPMATES.\n\nSACRED TO THE MEMORY OF The late CAPTAIN EZEKIEL HARDY, Who in the bows of his\nboat was killed by a Sperm Whale on the coast of Japan, August 3d, 1833. THIS\nTABLET Is erected to his Memory BY HIS WIDOW.\n\nShaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket, I seated myself near\nthe door, and turning sideways was surprised to see Queequeg near me. Affected\nby the solemnity of the scene, there was a wondering gaze of incredulous\ncuriosity in his countenance. This savage was the only person present who seemed\nto notice my entrance; because he was the only one who could not read, and,\ntherefore, was not reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall. Whether any of\nthe relatives of the seamen whose names appeared there were now among the\ncongregation, I knew not; but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the\nfishery, and so plainly did several women present wear the countenance if not\nthe trappings of some unceasing grief, that I feel sure that here before me were\nassembled those, in whose unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak tablets\nsympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed afresh.\n\nOh! ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass; who standing among flowers\ncan say—here, here lies my beloved; ye know not the desolation that broods in\nbosoms like these. What bitter blanks in those black-bordered marbles which\ncover no ashes! What despair in those immovable inscriptions! What deadly voids\nand unbidden infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all Faith, and\nrefuse resurrections to the beings who have placelessly perished without a\ngrave. As well might those tablets stand in the cave of Elephanta as here.\n\nIn what census of living creatures, the dead of mankind are included; why it is\nthat a universal proverb says of them, that they tell no tales, though\ncontaining more secrets than the Goodwin Sands; how it is that to his name who\nyesterday departed for the other world, we prefix so significant and infidel a\nword, and yet do not thus entitle him, if he but embarks for the remotest Indies\nof this living earth; why the Life Insurance Companies pay death-forfeitures\nupon immortals; in what eternal, unstirring paralysis, and deadly, hopeless\ntrance, yet lies antique Adam who died sixty round centuries ago; how it is that\nwe still refuse to be comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain are\ndwelling in unspeakable bliss; why all the living so strive to hush all the\ndead; wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a whole city.\nAll these things are not without their meanings.\n\nBut Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even from these dead doubts\nshe gathers her most vital hope.\n\nIt needs scarcely to be told, with what feelings, on the eve of a Nantucket\nvoyage, I regarded those marble tablets, and by the murky light of that\ndarkened, doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who had gone before me. Yes,\nIshmael, the same fate may be thine. But somehow I grew merry again. Delightful\ninducements to embark, fine chance for promotion, it seems—aye, a stove boat\nwill make me an immortal by brevet. Yes, there is death in this business of\nwhaling—a speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into Eternity. But what\nthen? Methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of Life and Death. Methinks\nthat what they call my shadow here on earth is my true substance. Methinks that\nin looking at things spiritual, we are too much like oysters observing the sun\nthrough the water, and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air. Methinks\nmy body is but the lees of my better being. In fact take my body who will, take\nit I say, it is not me. And therefore three cheers for Nantucket; and come a\nstove boat and stove body when they will, for stave my soul, Jove himself\ncannot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8. THE PULPIT.\n\nI had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable robustness\nentered; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back upon admitting him, a\nquick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation, sufficiently attested\nthat this fine old man was the chaplain. Yes, it was the famous Father Mapple,\nso called by the whalemen, among whom he was a very great favourite. He had been\na sailor and a harpooneer in his youth, but for many years past had dedicated\nhis life to the ministry. At the time I now write of, Father Mapple was in the\nhardy winter of a healthy old age; that sort of old age which seems merging into\na second flowering youth, for among all the fissures of his wrinkles, there\nshone certain mild gleams of a newly developing bloom—the spring verdure peeping\nforth even beneath February’s snow. No one having previously heard his history,\ncould for the first time behold Father Mapple without the utmost interest,\nbecause there were certain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him, imputable\nto that adventurous maritime life he had led. When he entered I observed that he\ncarried no umbrella, and certainly had not come in his carriage, for his\ntarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet, and his great pilot cloth jacket\nseemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had\nabsorbed. However, hat and coat and overshoes were one by one removed, and hung\nup in a little space in an adjacent corner; when, arrayed in a decent suit, he\nquietly approached the pulpit.\n\nLike most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a regular\nstairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the floor, seriously\ncontract the already small area of the chapel, the architect, it seemed, had\nacted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and finished the pulpit without a stairs,\nsubstituting a perpendicular side ladder, like those used in mounting a ship\nfrom a boat at sea. The wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a\nhandsome pair of red worsted man-ropes for this ladder, which, being itself\nnicely headed, and stained with a mahogany colour, the whole contrivance,\nconsidering what manner of chapel it was, seemed by no means in bad taste.\nHalting for an instant at the foot of the ladder, and with both hands grasping\nthe ornamental knobs of the man-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upwards, and\nthen with a truly sailor-like but still reverential dexterity, hand over hand,\nmounted the steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel.\n\nThe perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case with\nswinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were of wood, so that\nat every step there was a joint. At my first glimpse of the pulpit, it had not\nescaped me that however convenient for a ship, these joints in the present\ninstance seemed unnecessary. For I was not prepared to see Father Mapple after\ngaining the height, slowly turn round, and stooping over the pulpit,\ndeliberately drag up the ladder step by step, till the whole was deposited\nwithin, leaving him impregnable in his little Quebec.\n\nI pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this. Father\nMapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity, that I could\nnot suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks of the stage. No,\nthought I, there must be some sober reason for this thing; furthermore, it must\nsymbolize something unseen. Can it be, then, that by that act of physical\nisolation, he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward\nworldly ties and connexions? Yes, for replenished with the meat and wine of the\nword, to the faithful man of God, this pulpit, I see, is a self-containing\nstronghold—a lofty Ehrenbreitstein, with a perennial well of water within the\nwalls.\n\nBut the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place, borrowed from\nthe chaplain’s former sea-farings. Between the marble cenotaphs on either hand\nof the pulpit, the wall which formed its back was adorned with a large painting\nrepresenting a gallant ship beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of\nblack rocks and snowy breakers. But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling\nclouds, there floated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed forth an\nangel’s face; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the\nship’s tossed deck, something like that silver plate now inserted into the\nVictory’s plank where Nelson fell. “Ah, noble ship,” the angel seemed to say,\n“beat on, beat on, thou noble ship, and bear a hardy helm; for lo! the sun is\nbreaking through; the clouds are rolling off—serenest azure is at hand.”\n\nNor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that had\nachieved the ladder and the picture. Its panelled front was in the likeness of a\nship’s bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a projecting piece of scroll\nwork, fashioned after a ship’s fiddle-headed beak.\n\nWhat could be more full of meaning?—for the pulpit is ever this earth’s foremost\npart; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit leads the world. From thence it\nis the storm of God’s quick wrath is first descried, and the bow must bear the\nearliest brunt. From thence it is the God of breezes fair or foul is first\ninvoked for favourable winds. Yes, the world’s a ship on its passage out, and\nnot a voyage complete; and the pulpit is its prow.\n\n"},{"title":"Test Section Title","content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9. THE SERMON.\n\nFather Mapple rose, and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered the\nscattered people to condense. “Starboard gangway, there! side away to\nlarboard—larboard gangway to starboard! Midships! midships!”\n\nThere was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the benches, and a still\nslighter shuffling of women’s shoes, and all was quiet again, and every eye on\nthe preacher.\n\nHe paused a little; then kneeling in the pulpit’s bows, folded his large brown\nhands across his chest, uplifted his closed eyes, and offered a prayer so deeply\ndevout that he seemed kneeling and praying at the bottom of the sea.\n\nThis ended, in prolonged solemn tones, like the continual tolling of a bell in a\nship that is foundering at sea in a fog—in such tones he commenced reading the\nfollowing hymn; but changing his manner towards the concluding stanzas, burst\nforth with a pealing exultation and joy—\n\n     “The ribs and terrors in the whale,\n     Arched over me a dismal gloom,\n     While all God’s sun-lit waves rolled by,\n     And lift me deepening down to doom.\n\n     “I saw the opening maw of hell,\n     With endless pains and sorrows there;\n     Which none but they that feel can tell—\n     Oh, I was plunging to despair.\n\n     “In black distress, I called my God,\n     When I could scarce believe him mine,\n     He bowed his ear to my complaints—\n     No more the whale did me confine.\n\n     “With speed he flew to my relief,\n     As on a radiant dolphin borne;\n     Awful, yet bright, as lightning shone\n     The face of my Deliverer God.\n\n     “My song for ever shall record\n     That terrible, that joyful hour;\n     I give the glory to my God,\n     His all the mercy and the power.”\n \n\nNearly all joined in singing this hymn, which swelled high above the howling of\nthe storm. A brief pause ensued; the preacher slowly turned over the leaves of\nthe Bible, and at last, folding his hand down upon the proper page, said:\n“Beloved shipmates, clinch the last verse of the first chapter of Jonah—‘And God\nhad prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah.’”\n\n“Shipmates, this book, containing only four chapters—four yarns—is one of the\nsmallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures. Yet what depths of the\nsoul does Jonah’s deep sealine sound! what a pregnant lesson to us is this\nprophet! What a noble thing is that canticle in the fish’s belly! How\nbillow-like and boisterously grand! We feel the floods surging over us; we sound\nwith him to the kelpy bottom of the waters; sea-weed and all the slime of the\nsea is about us! But what is this lesson that the book of Jonah teaches?\nShipmates, it is a two-stranded lesson; a lesson to us all as sinful men, and a\nlesson to me as a pilot of the living God. As sinful men, it is a lesson to us\nall, because it is a story of the sin, hard-heartedness, suddenly awakened\nfears, the swift punishment, repentance, prayers, and finally the deliverance\nand joy of Jonah. As with all sinners among men, the sin of this son of Amittai\nwas in his wilful disobedience of the command of God—never mind now what that\ncommand was, or how conveyed—which he found a hard command. But all the things\nthat God would have us do are hard for us to do—remember that—and hence, he\noftener commands us than endeavors to persuade. And if we obey God, we must\ndisobey ourselves; and it is in this disobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness\nof obeying God consists.\n\n“With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further flouts at God, by\nseeking to flee from Him. He thinks that a ship made by men will carry him into\ncountries where God does not reign, but only the Captains of this earth. He\nskulks about the wharves of Joppa, and seeks a ship that’s bound for Tarshish.\nThere lurks, perhaps, a hitherto unheeded meaning here. By all accounts Tarshish\ncould have been no other city than the modern Cadiz. That’s the opinion of\nlearned men. And where is Cadiz, shipmates? Cadiz is in Spain; as far by water,\nfrom Joppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days, when the\nAtlantic was an almost unknown sea. Because Joppa, the modern Jaffa, shipmates,\nis on the most easterly coast of the Mediterranean, the Syrian; and Tarshish or\nCadiz more than two thousand miles to the westward from that, just outside the\nStraits of Gibraltar. See ye not then, shipmates, that Jonah sought to flee\nworld-wide from God? Miserable man! Oh! most contemptible and worthy of all\nscorn; with slouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his God; prowling among\nthe shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas. So disordered,\nself-condemning is his look, that had there been policemen in those days, Jonah,\non the mere suspicion of something wrong, had been arrested ere he touched a\ndeck. How plainly he’s a fugitive! no baggage, not a hat-box, valise, or\ncarpet-bag,—no friends accompany him to the wharf with their adieux. At last,\nafter much dodging search, he finds the Tarshish ship receiving the last items\nof her cargo; and as he steps on board to see its Captain in the cabin, all the\nsailors for the moment desist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger’s\nevil eye. Jonah sees this; but in vain he tries to look all ease and confidence;\nin vain essays his wretched smile. Strong intuitions of the man assure the\nmariners he can be no innocent. In their gamesome but still serious way, one\nwhispers to the other—“Jack, he’s robbed a widow;” or, “Joe, do you mark him;\nhe’s a bigamist;” or, “Harry lad, I guess he’s the adulterer that broke jail in\nold Gomorrah, or belike, one of the missing murderers from Sodom.” Another runs\nto read the bill that’s stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship\nis moored, offering five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a parricide,\nand containing a description of his person. He reads, and looks from Jonah to\nthe bill; while all his sympathetic shipmates now crowd round Jonah, prepared to\nlay their hands upon him. Frighted Jonah trembles, and summoning all his\nboldness to his face, only looks so much the more a coward. He will not confess\nhimself suspected; but that itself is strong suspicion. So he makes the best of\nit; and when the sailors find him not to be the man that is advertised, they let\nhim pass, and he descends into the cabin.\n\n“‘Who’s there?’ cries the Captain at his busy desk, hurriedly making out his\npapers for the Customs—‘Who’s there?’ Oh! how that harmless question mangles\nJonah! For the instant he almost turns to flee again. But he rallies. ‘I seek a\npassage in this ship to Tarshish; how soon sail ye, sir?’ Thus far the busy\nCaptain had not looked up to Jonah, though the man now stands before him; but no\nsooner does he hear that hollow voice, than he darts a scrutinizing glance. ‘We\nsail with the next coming tide,’ at last he slowly answered, still intently\neyeing him. ‘No sooner, sir?’—‘Soon enough for any honest man that goes a\npassenger.’ Ha! Jonah, that’s another stab. But he swiftly calls away the\nCaptain from that scent. ‘I’ll sail with ye,’—he says,—‘the passage money how\nmuch is that?—I’ll pay now.’ For it is particularly written, shipmates, as if it\nwere a thing not to be overlooked in this history, ‘that he paid the fare\nthereof’ ere the craft did sail. And taken with the context, this is full of\nmeaning.\n\n“Now Jonah’s Captain, shipmates, was one whose discernment detects crime in any,\nbut whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless. In this world, shipmates,\nsin that pays its way can travel freely, and without a passport; whereas Virtue,\nif a pauper, is stopped at all frontiers. So Jonah’s Captain prepares to test\nthe length of Jonah’s purse, ere he judge him openly. He charges him thrice the\nusual sum; and it’s assented to. Then the Captain knows that Jonah is a\nfugitive; but at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear\nwith gold. Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse, prudent suspicions still\nmolest the Captain. He rings every coin to find a counterfeit. Not a forger, any\nway, he mutters; and Jonah is put down for his passage. ‘Point out my\nstate-room, Sir,’ says Jonah now, ‘I’m travel-weary; I need sleep.’ ‘Thou\nlookest like it,’ says the Captain, ‘there’s thy room.’ Jonah enters, and would\nlock the door, but the lock contains no key. Hearing him foolishly fumbling\nthere, the Captain laughs lowly to himself, and mutters something about the\ndoors of convicts’ cells being never allowed to be locked within. All dressed\nand dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into his berth, and finds the little\nstate-room ceiling almost resting on his forehead. The air is close, and Jonah\ngasps. Then, in that contracted hole, sunk, too, beneath the ship’s water-line,\nJonah feels the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour, when the whale\nshall hold him in the smallest of his bowels’ wards.\n\n“Screwed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly oscillates in\nJonah’s room; and the ship, heeling over towards the wharf with the weight of\nthe last bales received, the lamp, flame and all, though in slight motion, still\nmaintains a permanent obliquity with reference to the room; though, in truth,\ninfallibly straight itself, it but made obvious the false, lying levels among\nwhich it hung. The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah; as lying in his berth his\ntormented eyes roll round the place, and this thus far successful fugitive finds\nno refuge for his restless glance. But that contradiction in the lamp more and\nmore appals him. The floor, the ceiling, and the side, are all awry. ‘Oh! so my\nconscience hangs in me!’ he groans, ‘straight upwards, so it burns; but the\nchambers of my soul are all in crookedness!’\n\n“Like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed, still reeling,\nbut with conscience yet pricking him, as the plungings of the Roman race-horse\nbut so much the more strike his steel tags into him; as one who in that\nmiserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish, praying God for\nannihilation until the fit be passed; and at last amid the whirl of woe he\nfeels, a deep stupor steals over him, as over the man who bleeds to death, for\nconscience is the wound, and there’s naught to staunch it; so, after sore\nwrestlings in his berth, Jonah’s prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning\ndown to sleep.\n\n“And now the time of tide has come; the ship casts off her cables; and from the\ndeserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish, all careening, glides to sea.\nThat ship, my friends, was the first of recorded smugglers! the contraband was\nJonah. But the sea rebels; he will not bear the wicked burden. A dreadful storm\ncomes on, the ship is like to break. But now when the boatswain calls all hands\nto lighten her; when boxes, bales, and jars are clattering overboard; when the\nwind is shrieking, and the men are yelling, and every plank thunders with\ntrampling feet right over Jonah’s head; in all this raging tumult, Jonah sleeps\nhis hideous sleep. He sees no black sky and raging sea, feels not the reeling\ntimbers, and little hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale, which\neven now with open mouth is cleaving the seas after him. Aye, shipmates, Jonah\nwas gone down into the sides of the ship—a berth in the cabin as I have taken\nit, and was fast asleep. But the frightened master comes to him, and shrieks in\nhis dead ear, ‘What meanest thou, O, sleeper! arise!’ Startled from his lethargy\nby that direful cry, Jonah staggers to his feet, and stumbling to the deck,\ngrasps a shroud, to look out upon the sea. But at that moment he is sprung upon\nby a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks. Wave after wave thus leaps into\nthe ship, and finding no speedy vent runs roaring fore and aft, till the\nmariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat. And ever, as the white moon\nshows her affrighted face from the steep gullies in the blackness overhead,\naghast Jonah sees the rearing bowsprit pointing high upward, but soon beat\ndownward again towards the tormented deep.\n\n“Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul. In all his cringing\nattitudes, the God-fugitive is now too plainly known. The sailors mark him; more\nand more certain grow their suspicions of him, and at last, fully to test the\ntruth, by referring the whole matter to high Heaven, they fall to casting lots,\nto see for whose cause this great tempest was upon them. The lot is Jonah’s;\nthat discovered, then how furiously they mob him with their questions. ‘What is\nthine occupation? Whence comest thou? Thy country? What people? But mark now, my\nshipmates, the behavior of poor Jonah. The eager mariners but ask him who he is,\nand where from; whereas, they not only receive an answer to those questions, but\nlikewise another answer to a question not put by them, but the unsolicited\nanswer is forced from Jonah by the hard hand of God that is upon him.\n\n“‘I am a Hebrew,’ he cries—and then—‘I fear the Lord the God of Heaven who hath\nmade the sea and the dry land!’ Fear him, O Jonah? Aye, well mightest thou fear\nthe Lord God then! Straightway, he now goes on to make a full confession;\nwhereupon the mariners became more and more appalled, but still are pitiful. For\nwhen Jonah, not yet supplicating God for mercy, since he but too well knew the\ndarkness of his deserts,—when wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him and\ncast him forth into the sea, for he knew that for his sake this great tempest\nwas upon them; they mercifully turn from him, and seek by other means to save\nthe ship. But all in vain; the indignant gale howls louder; then, with one hand\nraised invokingly to God, with the other they not unreluctantly lay hold of\nJonah.\n\n“And now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea; when\ninstantly an oily calmness floats out from the east, and the sea is still, as\nJonah carries down the gale with him, leaving smooth water behind. He goes down\nin the whirling heart of such a masterless commotion that he scarce heeds the\nmoment when he drops seething into the yawning jaws awaiting him; and the whale\nshoots-to all his ivory teeth, like so many white bolts, upon his prison. Then\nJonah prayed unto the Lord out of the fish’s belly. But observe his prayer, and\nlearn a weighty lesson. For sinful as he is, Jonah does not weep and wail for\ndirect deliverance. He feels that his dreadful punishment is just. He leaves all\nhis deliverance to God, contenting himself with this, that spite of all his\npains and pangs, he will still look towards His holy temple. And here,\nshipmates, is true and faithful repentance; not clamorous for pardon, but\ngrateful for punishment. And how pleasing to God was this conduct in Jonah, is\nshown in the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale. Shipmates,\nI do not place Jonah before you to be copied for his sin but I do place him\nbefore you as a model for repentance. Sin not; but if you do, take heed to\nrepent of it like Jonah.”\n\nWhile he was speaking these words, the howling of the shrieking, slanting storm\nwithout seemed to add new power to the preacher, who, when describing Jonah’s\nsea-storm, seemed tossed by a storm himself. His deep chest heaved as with a\nground-swell; his tossed arms seemed the warring elements at work; and the\nthunders that rolled away from off his swarthy brow, and the light leaping from\nhis eye, made all his simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was\nstrange to them.\n\nThere now came a lull in his look, as he silently turned over the leaves of the\nBook once more; and, at last, standing motionless, with closed eyes, for the\nmoment, seemed communing with God and himself.\n\nBut again he leaned over towards the people, and bowing his head lowly, with an\naspect of the deepest yet manliest humility, he spake these words:\n\n“Shipmates, God has laid but one hand upon you; both his hands press upon me. I\nhave read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that Jonah teaches to\nall sinners; and therefore to ye, and still more to me, for I am a greater\nsinner than ye. And now how gladly would I come down from this mast-head and sit\non the hatches there where you sit, and listen as you listen, while some one of\nyou reads me that other and more awful lesson which Jonah teaches to me, as a\npilot of the living God. How being an anointed pilot-prophet, or speaker of true\nthings, and bidden by the Lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the ears of a\nwicked Nineveh, Jonah, appalled at the hostility he should raise, fled from his\nmission, and sought to escape his duty and his God by taking ship at Joppa. But\nGod is everywhere; Tarshish he never reached. As we have seen, God came upon him\nin the whale, and swallowed him down to living gulfs of doom, and with swift\nslantings tore him along ‘into the midst of the seas,’ where the eddying depths\nsucked him ten thousand fathoms down, and ‘the weeds were wrapped about his\nhead,’ and all the watery world of woe bowled over him. Yet even then beyond the\nreach of any plummet—‘out of the belly of hell’—when the whale grounded upon the\nocean’s utmost bones, even then, God heard the engulphed, repenting prophet when\nhe cried. Then God spake unto the fish; and from the shuddering cold and\nblackness of the sea, the whale came breeching up towards the warm and pleasant\nsun, and all the delights of air and earth; and ‘vomited out Jonah upon the dry\nland;’ when the word of the Lord came a second time; and Jonah, bruised and\nbeaten—his ears, like two sea-shells, still multitudinously murmuring of the\nocean—Jonah did the Almighty’s bidding. And what was that, shipmates? To preach\nthe Truth to the face of Falsehood! That was it!\n\n“This, shipmates, this is that other lesson; and woe to that pilot of the living\nGod who slights it. Woe to him whom this world charms from Gospel duty! Woe to\nhim who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when God has brewed them into a gale!\nWoe to him who seeks to please rather than to appal! Woe to him whose good name\nis more to him than goodness! Woe to him who, in this world, courts not\ndishonor! Woe to him who would not be true, even though to be false were\nsalvation! Yea, woe to him who, as the great Pilot Paul has it, while preaching\nto others is himself a castaway!”\n\nHe dropped and fell away from himself for a moment; then lifting his face to\nthem again, showed a deep joy in his eyes, as he cried out with a heavenly\nenthusiasm,—“But oh! shipmates! on the starboard hand of every woe, there is a\nsure delight; and higher the top of that delight, than the bottom of the woe is\ndeep. Is not the main-truck higher than the kelson is low? Delight is to him—a\nfar, far upward, and inward delight—who against the proud gods and commodores of\nthis earth, ever stands forth his own inexorable self. Delight is to him whose\nstrong arms yet support him, when the ship of this base treacherous world has\ngone down beneath him. Delight is to him, who gives no quarter in the truth, and\nkills, burns, and destroys all sin though he pluck it out from under the robes\nof Senators and Judges. Delight,—top-gallant delight is to him, who acknowledges\nno law or lord, but the Lord his God, and is only a patriot to heaven. Delight\nis to him, whom all the waves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob\ncan never shake from this sure Keel of the Ages. And eternal delight and\ndeliciousness will be his, who coming to lay him down, can say with his final\nbreath—O Father!—chiefly known to me by Thy rod—mortal or immortal, here I die.\nI have striven to be Thine, more than to be this world’s, or mine own. Yet this\nis nothing: I leave eternity to Thee; for what is man that he should live out\nthe lifetime of his God?”\n\nHe said no more, but slowly waving a benediction, covered his face with his\nhands, and so remained kneeling, till all the people had departed, and he was\nleft alone in the place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10. A BOSOM FRIEND.\n\nReturning to the Spouter-Inn from the Chapel, I found Queequeg there quite\nalone; he having left the Chapel before the benediction some time. He was\nsitting on a bench before the fire, with his feet on the stove hearth, and in\none hand was holding close up to his face that little negro idol of his; peering\nhard into its face, and with a jack-knife gently whittling away at its nose,\nmeanwhile humming to himself in his heathenish way.\n\nBut being now interrupted, he put up the image; and pretty soon, going to the\ntable, took up a large book there, and placing it on his lap began counting the\npages with deliberate regularity; at every fiftieth page—as I fancied—stopping a\nmoment, looking vacantly around him, and giving utterance to a long-drawn\ngurgling whistle of astonishment. He would then begin again at the next fifty;\nseeming to commence at number one each time, as though he could not count more\nthan fifty, and it was only by such a large number of fifties being found\ntogether, that his astonishment at the multitude of pages was excited.\n\nWith much interest I sat watching him. Savage though he was, and hideously\nmarred about the face—at least to my taste—his countenance yet had a something\nin it which was by no means disagreeable. You cannot hide the soul. Through all\nhis unearthly tattooings, I thought I saw the traces of a simple honest heart;\nand in his large, deep eyes, fiery black and bold, there seemed tokens of a\nspirit that would dare a thousand devils. And besides all this, there was a\ncertain lofty bearing about the Pagan, which even his uncouthness could not\naltogether maim. He looked like a man who had never cringed and never had had a\ncreditor. Whether it was, too, that his head being shaved, his forehead was\ndrawn out in freer and brighter relief, and looked more expansive than it\notherwise would, this I will not venture to decide; but certain it was his head\nwas phrenologically an excellent one. It may seem ridiculous, but it reminded me\nof General Washington’s head, as seen in the popular busts of him. It had the\nsame long regularly graded retreating slope from above the brows, which were\nlikewise very projecting, like two long promontories thickly wooded on top.\nQueequeg was George Washington cannibalistically developed.\n\nWhilst I was thus closely scanning him, half-pretending meanwhile to be looking\nout at the storm from the casement, he never heeded my presence, never troubled\nhimself with so much as a single glance; but appeared wholly occupied with\ncounting the pages of the marvellous book. Considering how sociably we had been\nsleeping together the night previous, and especially considering the\naffectionate arm I had found thrown over me upon waking in the morning, I\nthought this indifference of his very strange. But savages are strange beings;\nat times you do not know exactly how to take them. At first they are overawing;\ntheir calm self-collectedness of simplicity seems a Socratic wisdom. I had\nnoticed also that Queequeg never consorted at all, or but very little, with the\nother seamen in the inn. He made no advances whatever; appeared to have no\ndesire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances. All this struck me as mighty\nsingular; yet, upon second thoughts, there was something almost sublime in it.\nHere was a man some twenty thousand miles from home, by the way of Cape Horn,\nthat is—which was the only way he could get there—thrown among people as strange\nto him as though he were in the planet Jupiter; and yet he seemed entirely at\nhis ease; preserving the utmost serenity; content with his own companionship;\nalways equal to himself. Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy; though no\ndoubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that. But, perhaps, to be\ntrue philosophers, we mortals should not be conscious of so living or so\nstriving. So soon as I hear that such or such a man gives himself out for a\nphilosopher, I conclude that, like the dyspeptic old woman, he must have “broken\nhis digester.”\n\nAs I sat there in that now lonely room; the fire burning low, in that mild stage\nwhen, after its first intensity has warmed the air, it then only glows to be\nlooked at; the evening shades and phantoms gathering round the casements, and\npeering in upon us silent, solitary twain; the storm booming without in solemn\nswells; I began to be sensible of strange feelings. I felt a melting in me. No\nmore my splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish\nworld. This soothing savage had redeemed it. There he sat, his very indifference\nspeaking a nature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland\ndeceits. Wild he was; a very sight of sights to see; yet I began to feel myself\nmysteriously drawn towards him. And those same things that would have repelled\nmost others, they were the very magnets that thus drew me. I’ll try a pagan\nfriend, thought I, since Christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy. I\ndrew my bench near him, and made some friendly signs and hints, doing my best to\ntalk with him meanwhile. At first he little noticed these advances; but\npresently, upon my referring to his last night’s hospitalities, he made out to\nask me whether we were again to be bedfellows. I told him yes; whereat I thought\nhe looked pleased, perhaps a little complimented.\n\nWe then turned over the book together, and I endeavored to explain to him the\npurpose of the printing, and the meaning of the few pictures that were in it.\nThus I soon engaged his interest; and from that we went to jabbering the best we\ncould about the various outer sights to be seen in this famous town. Soon I\nproposed a social smoke; and, producing his pouch and tomahawk, he quietly\noffered me a puff. And then we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his,\nand keeping it regularly passing between us.\n\nIf there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the Pagan’s breast,\nthis pleasant, genial smoke we had, soon thawed it out, and left us cronies. He\nseemed to take to me quite as naturally and unbiddenly as I to him; and when our\nsmoke was over, he pressed his forehead against mine, clasped me round the\nwaist, and said that henceforth we were married; meaning, in his country’s\nphrase, that we were bosom friends; he would gladly die for me, if need should\nbe. In a countryman, this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too\npremature, a thing to be much distrusted; but in this simple savage those old\nrules would not apply.\n\nAfter supper, and another social chat and smoke, we went to our room together.\nHe made me a present of his embalmed head; took out his enormous tobacco wallet,\nand groping under the tobacco, drew out some thirty dollars in silver; then\nspreading them on the table, and mechanically dividing them into two equal\nportions, pushed one of them towards me, and said it was mine. I was going to\nremonstrate; but he silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers’ pockets. I let\nthem stay. He then went about his evening prayers, took out his idol, and\nremoved the paper fireboard. By certain signs and symptoms, I thought he seemed\nanxious for me to join him; but well knowing what was to follow, I deliberated a\nmoment whether, in case he invited me, I would comply or otherwise.\n\nI was a good Christian; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible\nPresbyterian Church. How then could I unite with this wild idolator in\nworshipping his piece of wood? But what is worship? thought I. Do you suppose\nnow, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of heaven and earth—pagans and all\nincluded—can possibly be jealous of an insignificant bit of black wood?\nImpossible! But what is worship?—to do the will of God—that is worship. And what\nis the will of God?—to do to my fellow man what I would have my fellow man to do\nto me—that is the will of God. Now, Queequeg is my fellow man. And what do I\nwish that this Queequeg would do to me? Why, unite with me in my particular\nPresbyterian form of worship. Consequently, I must then unite with him in his;\nergo, I must turn idolator. So I kindled the shavings; helped prop up the\ninnocent little idol; offered him burnt biscuit with Queequeg; salamed before\nhim twice or thrice; kissed his nose; and that done, we undressed and went to\nbed, at peace with our own consciences and all the world. But we did not go to\nsleep without some little chat.\n\nHow it is I know not; but there is no place like a bed for confidential\ndisclosures between friends. Man and wife, they say, there open the very bottom\nof their souls to each other; and some old couples often lie and chat over old\ntimes till nearly morning. Thus, then, in our hearts’ honeymoon, lay I and\nQueequeg—a cosy, loving pair.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 11. NIGHTGOWN.\n\nWe had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short intervals, and Queequeg\nnow and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs over mine, and then\ndrawing them back; so entirely sociable and free and easy were we; when, at\nlast, by reason of our confabulations, what little nappishness remained in us\naltogether departed, and we felt like getting up again, though day-break was yet\nsome way down the future.\n\nYes, we became very wakeful; so much so that our recumbent position began to\ngrow wearisome, and by little and little we found ourselves sitting up; the\nclothes well tucked around us, leaning against the head-board with our four\nknees drawn up close together, and our two noses bending over them, as if our\nkneepans were warming-pans. We felt very nice and snug, the more so since it was\nso chilly out of doors; indeed out of bed-clothes too, seeing that there was no\nfire in the room. The more so, I say, because truly to enjoy bodily warmth, some\nsmall part of you must be cold, for there is no quality in this world that is\nnot what it is merely by contrast. Nothing exists in itself. If you flatter\nyourself that you are all over comfortable, and have been so a long time, then\nyou cannot be said to be comfortable any more. But if, like Queequeg and me in\nthe bed, the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly chilled, why\nthen, indeed, in the general consciousness you feel most delightfully and\nunmistakably warm. For this reason a sleeping apartment should never be\nfurnished with a fire, which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich.\nFor the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket\nbetween you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air. Then there you lie\nlike the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal.\n\nWe had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time, when all at once I\nthought I would open my eyes; for when between sheets, whether by day or by\nnight, and whether asleep or awake, I have a way of always keeping my eyes shut,\nin order the more to concentrate the snugness of being in bed. Because no man\ncan ever feel his own identity aright except his eyes be closed; as if darkness\nwere indeed the proper element of our essences, though light be more congenial\nto our clayey part. Upon opening my eyes then, and coming out of my own pleasant\nand self-created darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the\nunilluminated twelve-o’clock-at-night, I experienced a disagreeable revulsion.\nNor did I at all object to the hint from Queequeg that perhaps it were best to\nstrike a light, seeing that we were so wide awake; and besides he felt a strong\ndesire to have a few quiet puffs from his Tomahawk. Be it said, that though I\nhad felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed the night before,\nyet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them.\nFor now I liked nothing better than to have Queequeg smoking by me, even in bed,\nbecause he seemed to be full of such serene household joy then. I no more felt\nunduly concerned for the landlord’s policy of insurance. I was only alive to the\ncondensed confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a\nreal friend. With our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders, we now passed\nthe Tomahawk from one to the other, till slowly there grew over us a blue\nhanging tester of smoke, illuminated by the flame of the new-lit lamp.\n\nWhether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to far distant\nscenes, I know not, but he now spoke of his native island; and, eager to hear\nhis history, I begged him to go on and tell it. He gladly complied. Though at\nthe time I but ill comprehended not a few of his words, yet subsequent\ndisclosures, when I had become more familiar with his broken phraseology, now\nenable me to present the whole story such as it may prove in the mere skeleton I\ngive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12. BIOGRAPHICAL.\n\nQueequeg was a native of Rokovoko, an island far away to the West and South. It\nis not down in any map; true places never are.\n\nWhen a new-hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in a grass\nclout, followed by the nibbling goats, as if he were a green sapling; even then,\nin Queequeg’s ambitious soul, lurked a strong desire to see something more of\nChristendom than a specimen whaler or two. His father was a High Chief, a King;\nhis uncle a High Priest; and on the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the\nwives of unconquerable warriors. There was excellent blood in his veins—royal\nstuff; though sadly vitiated, I fear, by the cannibal propensity he nourished in\nhis untutored youth.\n\nA Sag Harbor ship visited his father’s bay, and Queequeg sought a passage to\nChristian lands. But the ship, having her full complement of seamen, spurned his\nsuit; and not all the King his father’s influence could prevail. But Queequeg\nvowed a vow. Alone in his canoe, he paddled off to a distant strait, which he\nknew the ship must pass through when she quitted the island. On one side was a\ncoral reef; on the other a low tongue of land, covered with mangrove thickets\nthat grew out into the water. Hiding his canoe, still afloat, among these\nthickets, with its prow seaward, he sat down in the stern, paddle low in hand;\nand when the ship was gliding by, like a flash he darted out; gained her side;\nwith one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe; climbed up the\nchains; and throwing himself at full length upon the deck, grappled a ring-bolt\nthere, and swore not to let it go, though hacked in pieces.\n\nIn vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard; suspended a cutlass over\nhis naked wrists; Queequeg was the son of a King, and Queequeg budged not.\nStruck by his desperate dauntlessness, and his wild desire to visit Christendom,\nthe captain at last relented, and told him he might make himself at home. But\nthis fine young savage—this sea Prince of Wales, never saw the Captain’s cabin.\nThey put him down among the sailors, and made a whaleman of him. But like Czar\nPeter content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities, Queequeg disdained no\nseeming ignominy, if thereby he might happily gain the power of enlightening his\nuntutored countrymen. For at bottom—so he told me—he was actuated by a profound\ndesire to learn among the Christians, the arts whereby to make his people still\nhappier than they were; and more than that, still better than they were. But,\nalas! the practices of whalemen soon convinced him that even Christians could be\nboth miserable and wicked; infinitely more so, than all his father’s heathens.\nArrived at last in old Sag Harbor; and seeing what the sailors did there; and\nthen going on to Nantucket, and seeing how they spent their wages in that place\nalso, poor Queequeg gave it up for lost. Thought he, it’s a wicked world in all\nmeridians; I’ll die a pagan.\n\nAnd thus an old idolator at heart, he yet lived among these Christians, wore\ntheir clothes, and tried to talk their gibberish. Hence the queer ways about\nhim, though now some time from home.\n\nBy hints, I asked him whether he did not propose going back, and having a\ncoronation; since he might now consider his father dead and gone, he being very\nold and feeble at the last accounts. He answered no, not yet; and added that he\nwas fearful Christianity, or rather Christians, had unfitted him for ascending\nthe pure and undefiled throne of thirty pagan Kings before him. But by and by,\nhe said, he would return,—as soon as he felt himself baptized again. For the\nnonce, however, he proposed to sail about, and sow his wild oats in all four\noceans. They had made a harpooneer of him, and that barbed iron was in lieu of a\nsceptre now.\n\nI asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching his future movements.\nHe answered, to go to sea again, in his old vocation. Upon this, I told him that\nwhaling was my own design, and informed him of my intention to sail out of\nNantucket, as being the most promising port for an adventurous whaleman to\nembark from. He at once resolved to accompany me to that island, ship aboard the\nsame vessel, get into the same watch, the same boat, the same mess with me, in\nshort to share my every hap; with both my hands in his, boldly dip into the\nPotluck of both worlds. To all this I joyously assented; for besides the\naffection I now felt for Queequeg, he was an experienced harpooneer, and as\nsuch, could not fail to be of great usefulness to one, who, like me, was wholly\nignorant of the mysteries of whaling, though well acquainted with the sea, as\nknown to merchant seamen.\n\nHis story being ended with his pipe’s last dying puff, Queequeg embraced me,\npressed his forehead against mine, and blowing out the light, we rolled over\nfrom each other, this way and that, and very soon were sleeping.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 13. WHEELBARROW.\n\nNext morning, Monday, after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber, for a\nblock, I settled my own and comrade’s bill; using, however, my comrade’s money.\nThe grinning landlord, as well as the boarders, seemed amazingly tickled at the\nsudden friendship which had sprung up between me and Queequeg—especially as\nPeter Coffin’s cock and bull stories about him had previously so much alarmed me\nconcerning the very person whom I now companied with.\n\nWe borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our things, including my own poor\ncarpet-bag, and Queequeg’s canvas sack and hammock, away we went down to “the\nMoss,” the little Nantucket packet schooner moored at the wharf. As we were\ngoing along the people stared; not at Queequeg so much—for they were used to\nseeing cannibals like him in their streets,—but at seeing him and me upon such\nconfidential terms. But we heeded them not, going along wheeling the barrow by\nturns, and Queequeg now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon\nbarbs. I asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore, and\nwhether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons. To this, in\nsubstance, he replied, that though what I hinted was true enough, yet he had a\nparticular affection for his own harpoon, because it was of assured stuff, well\ntried in many a mortal combat, and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales. In\nshort, like many inland reapers and mowers, who go into the farmers’ meadows\narmed with their own scythes—though in no wise obliged to furnish them—even so,\nQueequeg, for his own private reasons, preferred his own harpoon.\n\nShifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny story about the\nfirst wheelbarrow he had ever seen. It was in Sag Harbor. The owners of his\nship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to carry his heavy chest to his\nboarding house. Not to seem ignorant about the thing—though in truth he was\nentirely so, concerning the precise way in which to manage the barrow—Queequeg\nputs his chest upon it; lashes it fast; and then shoulders the barrow and\nmarches up the wharf. “Why,” said I, “Queequeg, you might have known better than\nthat, one would think. Didn’t the people laugh?”\n\nUpon this, he told me another story. The people of his island of Rokovoko, it\nseems, at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water of young cocoanuts\ninto a large stained calabash like a punchbowl; and this punchbowl always forms\nthe great central ornament on the braided mat where the feast is held. Now a\ncertain grand merchant ship once touched at Rokovoko, and its commander—from all\naccounts, a very stately punctilious gentleman, at least for a sea captain—this\ncommander was invited to the wedding feast of Queequeg’s sister, a pretty young\nprincess just turned of ten. Well; when all the wedding guests were assembled at\nthe bride’s bamboo cottage, this Captain marches in, and being assigned the post\nof honor, placed himself over against the punchbowl, and between the High Priest\nand his majesty the King, Queequeg’s father. Grace being said,—for those people\nhave their grace as well as we—though Queequeg told me that unlike us, who at\nsuch times look downwards to our platters, they, on the contrary, copying the\nducks, glance upwards to the great Giver of all feasts—Grace, I say, being said,\nthe High Priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the island; that\nis, dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers into the bowl before the\nblessed beverage circulates. Seeing himself placed next the Priest, and noting\nthe ceremony, and thinking himself—being Captain of a ship—as having plain\nprecedence over a mere island King, especially in the King’s own house—the\nCaptain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the punchbowl;—taking it I suppose\nfor a huge finger-glass. “Now,” said Queequeg, “what you tink now?—Didn’t our\npeople laugh?”\n\nAt last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board the schooner.\nHoisting sail, it glided down the Acushnet river. On one side, New Bedford rose\nin terraces of streets, their ice-covered trees all glittering in the clear,\ncold air. Huge hills and mountains of casks on casks were piled upon her\nwharves, and side by side the world-wandering whale ships lay silent and safely\nmoored at last; while from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers, with\nblended noises of fires and forges to melt the pitch, all betokening that new\ncruises were on the start; that one most perilous and long voyage ended, only\nbegins a second; and a second ended, only begins a third, and so on, for ever\nand for aye. Such is the endlessness, yea, the intolerableness of all earthly\neffort.\n\nGaining the more open water, the bracing breeze waxed fresh; the little Moss\ntossed the quick foam from her bows, as a young colt his snortings. How I\nsnuffed that Tartar air!—how I spurned that turnpike earth!—that common highway\nall over dented with the marks of slavish heels and hoofs; and turned me to\nadmire the magnanimity of the sea which will permit no records.\n\nAt the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me. His dusky\nnostrils swelled apart; he showed his filed and pointed teeth. On, on we flew;\nand our offing gained, the Moss did homage to the blast; ducked and dived her\nbows as a slave before the Sultan. Sideways leaning, we sideways darted; every\nropeyarn tingling like a wire; the two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in\nland tornadoes. So full of this reeling scene were we, as we stood by the\nplunging bowsprit, that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of\nthe passengers, a lubber-like assembly, who marvelled that two fellow beings\nshould be so companionable; as though a white man were anything more dignified\nthan a whitewashed negro. But there were some boobies and bumpkins there, who,\nby their intense greenness, must have come from the heart and centre of all\nverdure. Queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind his\nback. I thought the bumpkin’s hour of doom was come. Dropping his harpoon, the\nbrawny savage caught him in his arms, and by an almost miraculous dexterity and\nstrength, sent him high up bodily into the air; then slightly tapping his stern\nin mid-somerset, the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet, while\nQueequeg, turning his back upon him, lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to\nme for a puff.\n\n“Capting! Capting!” yelled the bumpkin, running towards that officer; “Capting,\nCapting, here’s the devil.”\n\n“Hallo, you sir,” cried the Captain, a gaunt rib of the sea, stalking up to\nQueequeg, “what in thunder do you mean by that? Don’t you know you might have\nkilled that chap?”\n\n“What him say?” said Queequeg, as he mildly turned to me.\n\n“He say,” said I, “that you came near kill-e that man there,” pointing to the\nstill shivering greenhorn.\n\n“Kill-e,” cried Queequeg, twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly\nexpression of disdain, “ah! him bevy small-e fish-e; Queequeg no kill-e so\nsmall-e fish-e; Queequeg kill-e big whale!”\n\n“Look you,” roared the Captain, “I’ll kill-e you, you cannibal, if you try any\nmore of your tricks aboard here; so mind your eye.”\n\nBut it so happened just then, that it was high time for the Captain to mind his\nown eye. The prodigious strain upon the main-sail had parted the weather-sheet,\nand the tremendous boom was now flying from side to side, completely sweeping\nthe entire after part of the deck. The poor fellow whom Queequeg had handled so\nroughly, was swept overboard; all hands were in a panic; and to attempt\nsnatching at the boom to stay it, seemed madness. It flew from right to left,\nand back again, almost in one ticking of a watch, and every instant seemed on\nthe point of snapping into splinters. Nothing was done, and nothing seemed\ncapable of being done; those on deck rushed towards the bows, and stood eyeing\nthe boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale. In the midst of\nthis consternation, Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and crawling under the\npath of the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured one end to the bulwarks, and\nthen flinging the other like a lasso, caught it round the boom as it swept over\nhis head, and at the next jerk, the spar was that way trapped, and all was safe.\nThe schooner was run into the wind, and while the hands were clearing away the\nstern boat, Queequeg, stripped to the waist, darted from the side with a long\nliving arc of a leap. For three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog,\nthrowing his long arms straight out before him, and by turns revealing his\nbrawny shoulders through the freezing foam. I looked at the grand and glorious\nfellow, but saw no one to be saved. The greenhorn had gone down. Shooting\nhimself perpendicularly from the water, Queequeg, now took an instant’s glance\naround him, and seeming to see just how matters were, dived down and\ndisappeared. A few minutes more, and he rose again, one arm still striking out,\nand with the other dragging a lifeless form. The boat soon picked them up. The\npoor bumpkin was restored. All hands voted Queequeg a noble trump; the captain\nbegged his pardon. From that hour I clove to Queequeg like a barnacle; yea, till\npoor Queequeg took his last long dive.\n\nWas there ever such unconsciousness? He did not seem to think that he at all\ndeserved a medal from the Humane and Magnanimous Societies. He only asked for\nwater—fresh water—something to wipe the brine off; that done, he put on dry\nclothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning against the bulwarks, and mildly eyeing\nthose around him, seemed to be saying to himself—“It’s a mutual, joint-stock\nworld, in all meridians. We cannibals must help these Christians.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 14. NANTUCKET.\n\nNothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning; so, after a fine\nrun, we safely arrived in Nantucket.\n\nNantucket! Take out your map and look at it. See what a real corner of the world\nit occupies; how it stands there, away off shore, more lonely than the Eddystone\nlighthouse. Look at it—a mere hillock, and elbow of sand; all beach, without a\nbackground. There is more sand there than you would use in twenty years as a\nsubstitute for blotting paper. Some gamesome wights will tell you that they have\nto plant weeds there, they don’t grow naturally; that they import Canada\nthistles; that they have to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an\noil cask; that pieces of wood in Nantucket are carried about like bits of the\ntrue cross in Rome; that people there plant toadstools before their houses, to\nget under the shade in summer time; that one blade of grass makes an oasis,\nthree blades in a day’s walk a prairie; that they wear quicksand shoes,\nsomething like Laplander snow-shoes; that they are so shut up, belted about,\nevery way inclosed, surrounded, and made an utter island of by the ocean, that\nto their very chairs and tables small clams will sometimes be found adhering, as\nto the backs of sea turtles. But these extravaganzas only show that Nantucket is\nno Illinois.\n\nLook now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was settled by the\nred-men. Thus goes the legend. In olden times an eagle swooped down upon the New\nEngland coast, and carried off an infant Indian in his talons. With loud lament\nthe parents saw their child borne out of sight over the wide waters. They\nresolved to follow in the same direction. Setting out in their canoes, after a\nperilous passage they discovered the island, and there they found an empty ivory\ncasket,—the poor little Indian’s skeleton.\n\nWhat wonder, then, that these Nantucketers, born on a beach, should take to the\nsea for a livelihood! They first caught crabs and quohogs in the sand; grown\nbolder, they waded out with nets for mackerel; more experienced, they pushed off\nin boats and captured cod; and at last, launching a navy of great ships on the\nsea, explored this watery world; put an incessant belt of circumnavigations\nround it; peeped in at Behring’s Straits; and in all seasons and all oceans\ndeclared everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the\nflood; most monstrous and most mountainous! That Himmalehan, salt-sea Mastodon,\nclothed with such portentousness of unconscious power, that his very panics are\nmore to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious assaults!\n\nAnd thus have these naked Nantucketers, these sea hermits, issuing from their\nant-hill in the sea, overrun and conquered the watery world like so many\nAlexanders; parcelling out among them the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans,\nas the three pirate powers did Poland. Let America add Mexico to Texas, and pile\nCuba upon Canada; let the English overswarm all India, and hang out their\nblazing banner from the sun; two thirds of this terraqueous globe are the\nNantucketer’s. For the sea is his; he owns it, as Emperors own empires; other\nseamen having but a right of way through it. Merchant ships are but extension\nbridges; armed ones but floating forts; even pirates and privateers, though\nfollowing the sea as highwaymen the road, they but plunder other ships, other\nfragments of the land like themselves, without seeking to draw their living from\nthe bottomless deep itself. The Nantucketer, he alone resides and riots on the\nsea; he alone, in Bible language, goes down to it in ships; to and fro ploughing\nit as his own special plantation. There is his home; there lies his business,\nwhich a Noah’s flood would not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the millions\nin China. He lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie; he hides among\nthe waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the Alps. For years he knows\nnot the land; so that when he comes to it at last, it smells like another world,\nmore strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman. With the landless gull, that\nat sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows; so at\nnightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight of land, furls his sails, and lays him\nto his rest, while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 15. CHOWDER.\n\nIt was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to anchor, and\nQueequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no business that day, at least\nnone but a supper and a bed. The landlord of the Spouter-Inn had recommended us\nto his cousin Hosea Hussey of the Try Pots, whom he asserted to be the\nproprietor of one of the best kept hotels in all Nantucket, and moreover he had\nassured us that Cousin Hosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders. In\nshort, he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck\nat the Try Pots. But the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow\nwarehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard,\nand then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to\nthe starboard, and that done, then ask the first man we met where the place was:\nthese crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first, especially as, at\nthe outset, Queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse—our first point of\ndeparture—must be left on the larboard hand, whereas I had understood Peter\nCoffin to say it was on the starboard. However, by dint of beating about a\nlittle in the dark, and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to\ninquire the way, we at last came to something which there was no mistaking.\n\nTwo enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses’ ears, swung from\nthe cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an old doorway. The\nhorns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other side, so that this old\ntop-mast looked not a little like a gallows. Perhaps I was over sensitive to\nsuch impressions at the time, but I could not help staring at this gallows with\na vague misgiving. A sort of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two\nremaining horns; yes, two of them, one for Queequeg, and one for me. It’s\nominous, thinks I. A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port;\ntombstones staring at me in the whalemen’s chapel; and here a gallows! and a\npair of prodigious black pots too! Are these last throwing out oblique hints\ntouching Tophet?\n\nI was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with yellow\nhair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn, under a dull red lamp\nswinging there, that looked much like an injured eye, and carrying on a brisk\nscolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt.\n\n“Get along with ye,” said she to the man, “or I’ll be combing ye!”\n\n“Come on, Queequeg,” said I, “all right. There’s Mrs. Hussey.”\n\nAnd so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving Mrs. Hussey\nentirely competent to attend to all his affairs. Upon making known our desires\nfor a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey, postponing further scolding for the\npresent, ushered us into a little room, and seating us at a table spread with\nthe relics of a recently concluded repast, turned round to us and said—“Clam or\nCod?”\n\n“What’s that about Cods, ma’am?” said I, with much politeness.\n\n“Clam or Cod?” she repeated.\n\n“A clam for supper? a cold clam; is that what you mean, Mrs. Hussey?” says I,\n“but that’s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter time, ain’t it,\nMrs. Hussey?”\n\nBut being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple Shirt, who\nwas waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear nothing but the word\n“clam,” Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the kitchen, and\nbawling out “clam for two,” disappeared.\n\n“Queequeg,” said I, “do you think that we can make out a supper for us both on\none clam?”\n\nHowever, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the apparently\ncheerless prospect before us. But when that smoking chowder came in, the mystery\nwas delightfully explained. Oh, sweet friends! hearken to me. It was made of\nsmall juicy clams, scarcely bigger than hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship\nbiscuit, and salted pork cut up into little flakes; the whole enriched with\nbutter, and plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt. Our appetites being\nsharpened by the frosty voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing his favourite\nfishing food before him, and the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we\ndespatched it with great expedition: when leaning back a moment and bethinking\nme of Mrs. Hussey’s clam and cod announcement, I thought I would try a little\nexperiment. Stepping to the kitchen door, I uttered the word “cod” with great\nemphasis, and resumed my seat. In a few moments the savoury steam came forth\nagain, but with a different flavor, and in good time a fine cod-chowder was\nplaced before us.\n\nWe resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks I to\nmyself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head? What’s that\nstultifying saying about chowder-headed people? “But look, Queequeg, ain’t that\na live eel in your bowl? Where’s your harpoon?”\n\nFishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved its name; for\nthe pots there were always boiling chowders. Chowder for breakfast, and chowder\nfor dinner, and chowder for supper, till you began to look for fish-bones coming\nthrough your clothes. The area before the house was paved with clam-shells. Mrs.\nHussey wore a polished necklace of codfish vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his\naccount books bound in superior old shark-skin. There was a fishy flavor to the\nmilk, too, which I could not at all account for, till one morning happening to\ntake a stroll along the beach among some fishermen’s boats, I saw Hosea’s\nbrindled cow feeding on fish remnants, and marching along the sand with each\nfoot in a cod’s decapitated head, looking very slip-shod, I assure ye.\n\nSupper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs. Hussey concerning\nthe nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about to precede me up the stairs,\nthe lady reached forth her arm, and demanded his harpoon; she allowed no harpoon\nin her chambers. “Why not?” said I; “every true whaleman sleeps with his\nharpoon—but why not?” “Because it’s dangerous,” says she. “Ever since young\nStiggs coming from that unfort’nt v’y’ge of his, when he was gone four years and\na half, with only three barrels of ile, was found dead in my first floor back,\nwith his harpoon in his side; ever since then I allow no boarders to take sich\ndangerous weepons in their rooms at night. So, Mr. Queequeg” (for she had\nlearned his name), “I will just take this here iron, and keep it for you till\nmorning. But the chowder; clam or cod to-morrow for breakfast, men?”\n\n“Both,” says I; “and let’s have a couple of smoked herring by way of variety.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 16. THE SHIP.\n\nIn bed we concocted our plans for the morrow. But to my surprise and no small\nconcern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been diligently\nconsulting Yojo—the name of his black little god—and Yojo had told him two or\nthree times over, and strongly insisted upon it everyway, that instead of our\ngoing together among the whaling-fleet in harbor, and in concert selecting our\ncraft; instead of this, I say, Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the\nship should rest wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us; and,\nin order to do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself,\nI, Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though it had\nturned out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship myself, for the\npresent irrespective of Queequeg.\n\nI have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great\nconfidence in the excellence of Yojo’s judgment and surprising forecast of\nthings; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather good sort of\ngod, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in all cases did not\nsucceed in his benevolent designs.\n\nNow, this plan of Queequeg’s, or rather Yojo’s, touching the selection of our\ncraft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little relied upon\nQueequeg’s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and our\nfortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg,\nI was obliged to acquiesce; and accordingly prepared to set about this business\nwith a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly settle\nthat trifling little affair. Next morning early, leaving Queequeg shut up with\nYojo in our little bedroom—for it seemed that it was some sort of Lent or\nRamadan, or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that\nday; how it was I never could find out, for, though I applied myself to it\nseveral times, I never could master his liturgies and XXXIX Articles—leaving\nQueequeg, then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his\nsacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among the shipping. After much\nprolonged sauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt that there were three\nships up for three-years’ voyages—The Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the Pequod.\nDevil-Dam, I do not know the origin of; Tit-bit is obvious; Pequod, you will no\ndoubt remember, was the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts Indians; now\nextinct as the ancient Medes. I peered and pryed about the Devil-dam; from her,\nhopped over to the Tit-bit; and finally, going on board the Pequod, looked\naround her for a moment, and then decided that this was the very ship for us.\n\nYou may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I know;—square-toed\nluggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box galliots, and what not; but take\nmy word for it, you never saw such a rare old craft as this same rare old\nPequod. She was a ship of the old school, rather small if anything; with an\nold-fashioned claw-footed look about her. Long seasoned and weather-stained in\nthe typhoons and calms of all four oceans, her old hull’s complexion was\ndarkened like a French grenadier’s, who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia.\nHer venerable bows looked bearded. Her masts—cut somewhere on the coast of\nJapan, where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale—her masts stood\nstiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne. Her ancient decks\nwere worn and wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in Canterbury\nCathedral where Becket bled. But to all these her old antiquities, were added\nnew and marvellous features, pertaining to the wild business that for more than\nhalf a century she had followed. Old Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate,\nbefore he commanded another vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one\nof the principal owners of the Pequod,—this old Peleg, during the term of his\nchief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and inlaid it, all\nover, with a quaintness both of material and device, unmatched by anything\nexcept it be Thorkill-Hake’s carved buckler or bedstead. She was apparelled like\nany barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory.\nShe was a thing of trophies. A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in\nthe chased bones of her enemies. All round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were\ngarnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale,\ninserted there for pins, to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to. Those\nthews ran not through base blocks of land wood, but deftly travelled over\nsheaves of sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm, she\nsported there a tiller; and that tiller was in one mass, curiously carved from\nthe long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe. The helmsman who steered by\nthat tiller in a tempest, felt like the Tartar, when he holds back his fiery\nsteed by clutching its jaw. A noble craft, but somehow a most melancholy! All\nnoble things are touched with that.\n\nNow when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having authority, in\norder to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at first I saw nobody;\nbut I could not well overlook a strange sort of tent, or rather wigwam, pitched\na little behind the main-mast. It seemed only a temporary erection used in port.\nIt was of a conical shape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge\nslabs of limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of\nthe right-whale. Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle of these\nslabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each other, and at the apex united\nin a tufted point, where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the\ntop-knot on some old Pottowottamie Sachem’s head. A triangular opening faced\ntowards the bows of the ship, so that the insider commanded a complete view\nforward.\n\nAnd half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who by his\naspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and the ship’s work\nsuspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of command. He was seated on\nan old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all over with curious carving; and the\nbottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of\nwhich the wigwam was constructed.\n\nThere was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of the\nelderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen, and heavily\nrolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style; only there was a fine\nand almost microscopic net-work of the minutest wrinkles interlacing round his\neyes, which must have arisen from his continual sailings in many hard gales, and\nalways looking to windward;—for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become\npursed together. Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.\n\n“Is this the Captain of the Pequod?” said I, advancing to the door of the tent.\n\n“Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of him?” he\ndemanded.\n\n“I was thinking of shipping.”\n\n“Thou wast, wast thou? I see thou art no Nantucketer—ever been in a stove boat?”\n\n“No, Sir, I never have.”\n\n“Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say—eh?\n\n“Nothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn. I’ve been several voyages\nin the merchant service, and I think that—”\n\n“Merchant service be damned. Talk not that lingo to me. Dost see that leg?—I’ll\ntake that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou talkest of the marchant service\nto me again. Marchant service indeed! I suppose now ye feel considerable proud\nof having served in those marchant ships. But flukes! man, what makes thee want\nto go a whaling, eh?—it looks a little suspicious, don’t it, eh?—Hast not been a\npirate, hast thou?—Didst not rob thy last Captain, didst thou?—Dost not think of\nmurdering the officers when thou gettest to sea?”\n\nI protested my innocence of these things. I saw that under the mask of these\nhalf humorous innuendoes, this old seaman, as an insulated Quakerish\nNantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices, and rather distrustful of all\naliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the Vineyard.\n\n“But what takes thee a-whaling? I want to know that before I think of shipping\nye.”\n\n“Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is. I want to see the world.”\n\n“Want to see what whaling is, eh? Have ye clapped eye on Captain Ahab?”\n\n“Who is Captain Ahab, sir?”\n\n“Aye, aye, I thought so. Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship.”\n\n“I am mistaken then. I thought I was speaking to the Captain himself.”\n\n“Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg—that’s who ye are speaking to, young man. It\nbelongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted out for the voyage,\nand supplied with all her needs, including crew. We are part owners and agents.\nBut as I was going to say, if thou wantest to know what whaling is, as thou\ntellest ye do, I can put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself\nto it, past backing out. Clap eye on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt find\nthat he has only one leg.”\n\n“What do you mean, sir? Was the other one lost by a whale?”\n\n“Lost by a whale! Young man, come nearer to me: it was devoured, chewed up,\ncrunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a boat!—ah, ah!”\n\nI was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched at the\nhearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but said as calmly as I could, “What\nyou say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could I know there was any\npeculiar ferocity in that particular whale, though indeed I might have inferred\nas much from the simple fact of the accident.”\n\n“Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d’ye see; thou dost not\ntalk shark a bit. Sure, ye’ve been to sea before now; sure of that?”\n\n“Sir,” said I, “I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in the\nmerchant—”\n\n“Hard down out of that! Mind what I said about the marchant service—don’t\naggravate me—I won’t have it. But let us understand each other. I have given\nthee a hint about what whaling is; do ye yet feel inclined for it?”\n\n“I do, sir.”\n\n“Very good. Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale’s throat,\nand then jump after it? Answer, quick!”\n\n“I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to be got rid\nof, that is; which I don’t take to be the fact.”\n\n“Good again. Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to find out by\nexperience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in order to see the world?\nWas not that what ye said? I thought so. Well then, just step forward there, and\ntake a peep over the weather-bow, and then back to me and tell me what ye see\nthere.”\n\nFor a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not knowing\nexactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest. But concentrating all\nhis crow’s feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg started me on the errand.\n\nGoing forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the ship\nswinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely pointing towards\nthe open ocean. The prospect was unlimited, but exceedingly monotonous and\nforbidding; not the slightest variety that I could see.\n\n“Well, what’s the report?” said Peleg when I came back; “what did ye see?”\n\n“Not much,” I replied—“nothing but water; considerable horizon though, and\nthere’s a squall coming up, I think.”\n\n“Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world? Do ye wish to go round\nCape Horn to see any more of it, eh? Can’t ye see the world where you stand?”\n\nI was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and the Pequod\nwas as good a ship as any—I thought the best—and all this I now repeated to\nPeleg. Seeing me so determined, he expressed his willingness to ship me.\n\n“And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,” he added—“come along with\nye.” And so saying, he led the way below deck into the cabin.\n\nSeated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and surprising\nfigure. It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along with Captain Peleg was one\nof the largest owners of the vessel; the other shares, as is sometimes the case\nin these ports, being held by a crowd of old annuitants; widows, fatherless\nchildren, and chancery wards; each owning about the value of a timber head, or a\nfoot of plank, or a nail or two in the ship. People in Nantucket invest their\nmoney in whaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in approved state\nstocks bringing in good interest.\n\nNow, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a Quaker, the\nisland having been originally settled by that sect; and to this day its\ninhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities of the\nQuaker, only variously and anomalously modified by things altogether alien and\nheterogeneous. For some of these same Quakers are the most sanguinary of all\nsailors and whale-hunters. They are fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a\nvengeance.\n\nSo that there are instances among them of men, who, named with Scripture names—a\nsingularly common fashion on the island—and in childhood naturally imbibing the\nstately dramatic thee and thou of the Quaker idiom; still, from the audacious,\ndaring, and boundless adventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with\nthese unoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not\nunworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And when these\nthings unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a globular brain\nand a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and seclusion of many long\nnight-watches in the remotest waters, and beneath constellations never seen here\nat the north, been led to think untraditionally and independently; receiving all\nnature’s sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and\nconfiding breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help from accidental\nadvantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty language—that man makes one in a\nwhole nation’s census—a mighty pageant creature, formed for noble tragedies. Nor\nwill it at all detract from him, dramatically regarded, if either by birth or\nother circumstances, he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness at\nthe bottom of his nature. For all men tragically great are made so through a\ncertain morbidness. Be sure of this, O young ambition, all mortal greatness is\nbut disease. But, as yet we have not to do with such an one, but with quite\nanother; and still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only results again from\nanother phase of the Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.\n\nLike Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman. But\nunlike Captain Peleg—who cared not a rush for what are called serious things,\nand indeed deemed those self-same serious things the veriest of all\ntrifles—Captain Bildad had not only been originally educated according to the\nstrictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but all his subsequent ocean life, and\nthe sight of many unclad, lovely island creatures, round the Horn—all that had\nnot moved this native born Quaker one single jot, had not so much as altered one\nangle of his vest. Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of\ncommon consistency about worthy Captain Bildad. Though refusing, from\nconscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself had\nillimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe to human\nbloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns upon tuns of\nleviathan gore. How now in the contemplative evening of his days, the pious\nBildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do not know; but it did\nnot seem to concern him much, and very probably he had long since come to the\nsage and sensible conclusion that a man’s religion is one thing, and this\npractical world quite another. This world pays dividends. Rising from a little\ncabin-boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad\nshad-bellied waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header, chief-mate, and captain,\nand finally a ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded his\nadventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of\nsixty, and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his\nwell-earned income.\n\nNow, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an incorrigible old\nhunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard task-master. They told me in\nNantucket, though it certainly seems a curious story, that when he sailed the\nold Categut whaleman, his crew, upon arriving home, were mostly all carried\nashore to the hospital, sore exhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especially\nfor a Quaker, he was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the least. He never\nused to swear, though, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an inordinate\nquantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. When Bildad was a\nchief-mate, to have his drab-coloured eye intently looking at you, made you feel\ncompletely nervous, till you could clutch something—a hammer or a marling-spike,\nand go to work like mad, at something or other, never mind what. Indolence and\nidleness perished before him. His own person was the exact embodiment of his\nutilitarian character. On his long, gaunt body, he carried no spare flesh, no\nsuperfluous beard, his chin having a soft, economical nap to it, like the worn\nnap of his broad-brimmed hat.\n\nSuch, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I followed\nCaptain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the decks was small; and\nthere, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always sat so, and never leaned, and\nthis to save his coat tails. His broad-brim was placed beside him; his legs were\nstiffly crossed; his drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on\nnose, he seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume.\n\n“Bildad,” cried Captain Peleg, “at it again, Bildad, eh? Ye have been studying\nthose Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my certain knowledge. How\nfar ye got, Bildad?”\n\nAs if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate, Bildad,\nwithout noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up, and seeing me,\nglanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.\n\n“He says he’s our man, Bildad,” said Peleg, “he wants to ship.”\n\n“Dost thee?” said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.\n\n“I dost,” said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.\n\n“What do ye think of him, Bildad?” said Peleg.\n\n“He’ll do,” said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at his book\nin a mumbling tone quite audible.\n\nI thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg, his\nfriend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer. But I said nothing, only\nlooking round me sharply. Peleg now threw open a chest, and drawing forth the\nship’s articles, placed pen and ink before him, and seated himself at a little\ntable. I began to think it was high time to settle with myself at what terms I\nwould be willing to engage for the voyage. I was already aware that in the\nwhaling business they paid no wages; but all hands, including the captain,\nreceived certain shares of the profits called lays, and that these lays were\nproportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of\nthe ship’s company. I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my own\nlay would not be very large; but considering that I was used to the sea, could\nsteer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that from all I had\nheard I should be offered at least the 275th lay—that is, the 275th part of the\nclear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever that might eventually amount to. And\nthough the 275th lay was what they call a rather long lay, yet it was better\nthan nothing; and if we had a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the\nclothing I would wear out on it, not to speak of my three years’ beef and board,\nfor which I would not have to pay one stiver.\n\nIt might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely\nfortune—and so it was, a very poor way indeed. But I am one of those that never\ntake on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the world is ready to\nboard and lodge me, while I am putting up at this grim sign of the Thunder\nCloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair\nthing, but would not have been surprised had I been offered the 200th,\nconsidering I was of a broad-shouldered make.\n\nBut one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about receiving a\ngenerous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had heard something of both\nCaptain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad; how that they being the\nprincipal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore the other and more inconsiderable\nand scattered owners, left nearly the whole management of the ship’s affairs to\nthese two. And I did not know but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty\ndeal to say about shipping hands, especially as I now found him on board the\nPequod, quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his own\nfireside. Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his jack-knife,\nold Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he was such an interested\nparty in these proceedings; Bildad never heeded us, but went on mumbling to\nhimself out of his book, “Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where\nmoth—”\n\n“Well, Captain Bildad,” interrupted Peleg, “what d’ye say, what lay shall we\ngive this young man?”\n\n“Thou knowest best,” was the sepulchral reply, “the seven hundred and\nseventy-seventh wouldn’t be too much, would it?—‘where moth and rust do corrupt,\nbut lay—’”\n\nLay, indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and seventy-seventh!\nWell, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for one, shall not lay up many lays\nhere below, where moth and rust do corrupt. It was an exceedingly long lay that,\nindeed; and though from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a\nlandsman, yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred\nand seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you come to make a teenth\nof it, you will then see, I say, that the seven hundred and seventy-seventh part\nof a farthing is a good deal less than seven hundred and seventy-seven gold\ndoubloons; and so I thought at the time.\n\n“Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,” cried Peleg, “thou dost not want to swindle this\nyoung man! he must have more than that.”\n\n“Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,” again said Bildad, without lifting his\neyes; and then went on mumbling—“for where your treasure is, there will your\nheart be also.”\n\n“I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,” said Peleg, “do ye hear\nthat, Bildad! The three hundredth lay, I say.”\n\nBildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said, “Captain\nPeleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider the duty thou owest to\nthe other owners of this ship—widows and orphans, many of them—and that if we\ntoo abundantly reward the labors of this young man, we may be taking the bread\nfrom those widows and those orphans. The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay,\nCaptain Peleg.”\n\n“Thou Bildad!” roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the cabin. “Blast\nye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in these matters, I would afore\nnow had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy enough to founder the\nlargest ship that ever sailed round Cape Horn.”\n\n“Captain Peleg,” said Bildad steadily, “thy conscience may be drawing ten inches\nof water, or ten fathoms, I can’t tell; but as thou art still an impenitent man,\nCaptain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one; and will\nin the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.”\n\n“Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing, ye insult\nme. It’s an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that he’s bound to\nhell. Flukes and flames! Bildad, say that again to me, and start my soul-bolts,\nbut I’ll—I’ll—yes, I’ll swallow a live goat with all his hair and horns on. Out\nof the cabin, ye canting, drab-coloured son of a wooden gun—a straight wake with\nye!”\n\nAs he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a marvellous\noblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him.\n\nAlarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and responsible\nowners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up all idea of sailing in a\nvessel so questionably owned and temporarily commanded, I stepped aside from the\ndoor to give egress to Bildad, who, I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish\nfrom before the awakened wrath of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat down\nagain on the transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest\nintention of withdrawing. He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways.\nAs for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more left in\nhim, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a little as if still\nnervously agitated. “Whew!” he whistled at last—“the squall’s gone off to\nleeward, I think. Bildad, thou used to be good at sharpening a lance, mend that\npen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs the grindstone. That’s he; thank ye,\nBildad. Now then, my young man, Ishmael’s thy name, didn’t ye say? Well then,\ndown ye go here, Ishmael, for the three hundredth lay.”\n\n“Captain Peleg,” said I, “I have a friend with me who wants to ship too—shall I\nbring him down to-morrow?”\n\n“To be sure,” said Peleg. “Fetch him along, and we’ll look at him.”\n\n“What lay does he want?” groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book in which he\nhad again been burying himself.\n\n“Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad,” said Peleg. “Has he ever whaled it\nany?” turning to me.\n\n“Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.”\n\n“Well, bring him along then.”\n\nAnd, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that I had done\na good morning’s work, and that the Pequod was the identical ship that Yojo had\nprovided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape.\n\nBut I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the Captain with\nwhom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though, indeed, in many cases, a\nwhale-ship will be completely fitted out, and receive all her crew on board, ere\nthe captain makes himself visible by arriving to take command; for sometimes\nthese voyages are so prolonged, and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly\nbrief, that if the captain have a family, or any absorbing concernment of that\nsort, he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port, but leaves her to\nthe owners till all is ready for sea. However, it is always as well to have a\nlook at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands. Turning back\nI accosted Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found.\n\n“And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab? It’s all right enough; thou art\nshipped.”\n\n“Yes, but I should like to see him.”\n\n“But I don’t think thou wilt be able to at present. I don’t know exactly what’s\nthe matter with him; but he keeps close inside the house; a sort of sick, and\nyet he don’t look so. In fact, he ain’t sick; but no, he isn’t well either. Any\nhow, young man, he won’t always see me, so I don’t suppose he will thee. He’s a\nqueer man, Captain Ahab—so some think—but a good one. Oh, thou’lt like him well\nenough; no fear, no fear. He’s a grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab;\ndoesn’t speak much; but, when he does speak, then you may well listen. Mark ye,\nbe forewarned; Ahab’s above the common; Ahab’s been in colleges, as well as\n’mong the cannibals; been used to deeper wonders than the waves; fixed his fiery\nlance in mightier, stranger foes than whales. His lance! aye, the keenest and\nthe surest that out of all our isle! Oh! he ain’t Captain Bildad; no, and he\nain’t Captain Peleg; he’s Ahab, boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest, was a\ncrowned king!”\n\n“And a very vile one. When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did they not\nlick his blood?”\n\n“Come hither to me—hither, hither,” said Peleg, with a significance in his eye\nthat almost startled me. “Look ye, lad; never say that on board the Pequod.\nNever say it anywhere. Captain Ahab did not name himself. ’Twas a foolish,\nignorant whim of his crazy, widowed mother, who died when he was only a\ntwelvemonth old. And yet the old squaw Tistig, at Gayhead, said that the name\nwould somehow prove prophetic. And, perhaps, other fools like her may tell thee\nthe same. I wish to warn thee. It’s a lie. I know Captain Ahab well; I’ve sailed\nwith him as mate years ago; I know what he is—a good man—not a pious, good man,\nlike Bildad, but a swearing good man—something like me—only there’s a good deal\nmore of him. Aye, aye, I know that he was never very jolly; and I know that on\nthe passage home, he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but it was the\nsharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that about, as any one\nmight see. I know, too, that ever since he lost his leg last voyage by that\naccursed whale, he’s been a kind of moody—desperate moody, and savage sometimes;\nbut that will all pass off. And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee,\nyoung man, it’s better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad\none. So good-bye to thee—and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he happens to have\na wicked name. Besides, my boy, he has a wife—not three voyages wedded—a sweet,\nresigned girl. Think of that; by that sweet girl that old man has a child: hold\nye then there can be any utter, hopeless harm in Ahab? No, no, my lad; stricken,\nblasted, if he be, Ahab has his humanities!”\n\nAs I walked away, I was full of thoughtfulness; what had been incidentally\nrevealed to me of Captain Ahab, filled me with a certain wild vagueness of\npainfulness concerning him. And somehow, at the time, I felt a sympathy and a\nsorrow for him, but for I don’t know what, unless it was the cruel loss of his\nleg. And yet I also felt a strange awe of him; but that sort of awe, which I\ncannot at all describe, was not exactly awe; I do not know what it was. But I\nfelt it; and it did not disincline me towards him; though I felt impatience at\nwhat seemed like mystery in him, so imperfectly as he was known to me then.\nHowever, my thoughts were at length carried in other directions, so that for the\npresent dark Ahab slipped my mind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 17. THE RAMADAN.\n\nAs Queequeg’s Ramadan, or Fasting and Humiliation, was to continue all day, I\ndid not choose to disturb him till towards night-fall; for I cherish the\ngreatest respect towards everybody’s religious obligations, never mind how\ncomical, and could not find it in my heart to undervalue even a congregation of\nants worshipping a toad-stool; or those other creatures in certain parts of our\nearth, who with a degree of footmanism quite unprecedented in other planets, bow\ndown before the torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the\ninordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his name.\n\nI say, we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in these things, and\nnot fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals, pagans and what not,\nbecause of their half-crazy conceits on these subjects. There was Queequeg, now,\ncertainly entertaining the most absurd notions about Yojo and his Ramadan;—but\nwhat of that? Queequeg thought he knew what he was about, I suppose; he seemed\nto be content; and there let him rest. All our arguing with him would not avail;\nlet him be, I say: and Heaven have mercy on us all—Presbyterians and Pagans\nalike—for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head, and sadly need\nmending.\n\nTowards evening, when I felt assured that all his performances and rituals must\nbe over, I went up to his room and knocked at the door; but no answer. I tried\nto open it, but it was fastened inside. “Queequeg,” said I softly through the\nkey-hole:—all silent. “I say, Queequeg! why don’t you speak? It’s I—Ishmael.”\nBut all remained still as before. I began to grow alarmed. I had allowed him\nsuch abundant time; I thought he might have had an apoplectic fit. I looked\nthrough the key-hole; but the door opening into an odd corner of the room, the\nkey-hole prospect was but a crooked and sinister one. I could only see part of\nthe foot-board of the bed and a line of the wall, but nothing more. I was\nsurprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden shaft of Queequeg’s\nharpoon, which the landlady the evening previous had taken from him, before our\nmounting to the chamber. That’s strange, thought I; but at any rate, since the\nharpoon stands yonder, and he seldom or never goes abroad without it, therefore\nhe must be inside here, and no possible mistake.\n\n“Queequeg!—Queequeg!”—all still. Something must have happened. Apoplexy! I tried\nto burst open the door; but it stubbornly resisted. Running down stairs, I\nquickly stated my suspicions to the first person I met—the chamber-maid. “La!\nla!” she cried, “I thought something must be the matter. I went to make the bed\nafter breakfast, and the door was locked; and not a mouse to be heard; and it’s\nbeen just so silent ever since. But I thought, may be, you had both gone off and\nlocked your baggage in for safe keeping. La! la, ma’am!—Mistress! murder! Mrs.\nHussey! apoplexy!”—and with these cries, she ran towards the kitchen, I\nfollowing.\n\nMrs. Hussey soon appeared, with a mustard-pot in one hand and a vinegar-cruet in\nthe other, having just broken away from the occupation of attending to the\ncastors, and scolding her little black boy meantime.\n\n“Wood-house!” cried I, “which way to it? Run for God’s sake, and fetch something\nto pry open the door—the axe!—the axe! he’s had a stroke; depend upon it!”—and\nso saying I was unmethodically rushing up stairs again empty-handed, when Mrs.\nHussey interposed the mustard-pot and vinegar-cruet, and the entire castor of\nher countenance.\n\n“What’s the matter with you, young man?”\n\n“Get the axe! For God’s sake, run for the doctor, some one, while I pry it\nopen!”\n\n“Look here,” said the landlady, quickly putting down the vinegar-cruet, so as to\nhave one hand free; “look here; are you talking about prying open any of my\ndoors?”—and with that she seized my arm. “What’s the matter with you? What’s the\nmatter with you, shipmate?”\n\nIn as calm, but rapid a manner as possible, I gave her to understand the whole\ncase. Unconsciously clapping the vinegar-cruet to one side of her nose, she\nruminated for an instant; then exclaimed—“No! I haven’t seen it since I put it\nthere.” Running to a little closet under the landing of the stairs, she glanced\nin, and returning, told me that Queequeg’s harpoon was missing. “He’s killed\nhimself,” she cried. “It’s unfort’nate Stiggs done over again—there goes another\ncounterpane—God pity his poor mother!—it will be the ruin of my house. Has the\npoor lad a sister? Where’s that girl?—there, Betty, go to Snarles the Painter,\nand tell him to paint me a sign, with—“no suicides permitted here, and no\nsmoking in the parlor;”—might as well kill both birds at once. Kill? The Lord be\nmerciful to his ghost! What’s that noise there? You, young man, avast there!”\n\nAnd running up after me, she caught me as I was again trying to force open the\ndoor.\n\n“I don’t allow it; I won’t have my premises spoiled. Go for the locksmith,\nthere’s one about a mile from here. But avast!” putting her hand in her\nside-pocket, “here’s a key that’ll fit, I guess; let’s see.” And with that, she\nturned it in the lock; but, alas! Queequeg’s supplemental bolt remained\nunwithdrawn within.\n\n“Have to burst it open,” said I, and was running down the entry a little, for a\ngood start, when the landlady caught at me, again vowing I should not break down\nher premises; but I tore from her, and with a sudden bodily rush dashed myself\nfull against the mark.\n\nWith a prodigious noise the door flew open, and the knob slamming against the\nwall, sent the plaster to the ceiling; and there, good heavens! there sat\nQueequeg, altogether cool and self-collected; right in the middle of the room;\nsquatting on his hams, and holding Yojo on top of his head. He looked neither\none way nor the other way, but sat like a carved image with scarce a sign of\nactive life.\n\n“Queequeg,” said I, going up to him, “Queequeg, what’s the matter with you?”\n\n“He hain’t been a sittin’ so all day, has he?” said the landlady.\n\nBut all we said, not a word could we drag out of him; I almost felt like pushing\nhim over, so as to change his position, for it was almost intolerable, it seemed\nso painfully and unnaturally constrained; especially, as in all probability he\nhad been sitting so for upwards of eight or ten hours, going too without his\nregular meals.\n\n“Mrs. Hussey,” said I, “he’s alive at all events; so leave us, if you please,\nand I will see to this strange affair myself.”\n\nClosing the door upon the landlady, I endeavored to prevail upon Queequeg to\ntake a chair; but in vain. There he sat; and all he could do—for all my polite\narts and blandishments—he would not move a peg, nor say a single word, nor even\nlook at me, nor notice my presence in the slightest way.\n\nI wonder, thought I, if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan; do they fast\non their hams that way in his native island. It must be so; yes, it’s part of\nhis creed, I suppose; well, then, let him rest; he’ll get up sooner or later, no\ndoubt. It can’t last for ever, thank God, and his Ramadan only comes once a\nyear; and I don’t believe it’s very punctual then.\n\nI went down to supper. After sitting a long time listening to the long stories\nof some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding voyage, as they called it\n(that is, a short whaling-voyage in a schooner or brig, confined to the north of\nthe line, in the Atlantic Ocean only); after listening to these plum-puddingers\ntill nearly eleven o’clock, I went up stairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure by\nthis time Queequeg must certainly have brought his Ramadan to a termination. But\nno; there he was just where I had left him; he had not stirred an inch. I began\nto grow vexed with him; it seemed so downright senseless and insane to be\nsitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room, holding a\npiece of wood on his head.\n\n“For heaven’s sake, Queequeg, get up and shake yourself; get up and have some\nsupper. You’ll starve; you’ll kill yourself, Queequeg.” But not a word did he\nreply.\n\nDespairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep; and no\ndoubt, before a great while, he would follow me. But previous to turning in, I\ntook my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over him, as it promised to be a\nvery cold night; and he had nothing but his ordinary round jacket on. For some\ntime, do all I would, I could not get into the faintest doze. I had blown out\nthe candle; and the mere thought of Queequeg—not four feet off—sitting there in\nthat uneasy position, stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me really\nwretched. Think of it; sleeping all night in the same room with a wide awake\npagan on his hams in this dreary, unaccountable Ramadan!\n\nBut somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break of day;\nwhen, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as if he had been\nscrewed down to the floor. But as soon as the first glimpse of sun entered the\nwindow, up he got, with stiff and grating joints, but with a cheerful look;\nlimped towards me where I lay; pressed his forehead again against mine; and said\nhis Ramadan was over.\n\nNow, as I before hinted, I have no objection to any person’s religion, be it\nwhat it may, so long as that person does not kill or insult any other person,\nbecause that other person don’t believe it also. But when a man’s religion\nbecomes really frantic; when it is a positive torment to him; and, in fine,\nmakes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to lodge in; then I think it high\ntime to take that individual aside and argue the point with him.\n\nAnd just so I now did with Queequeg. “Queequeg,” said I, “get into bed now, and\nlie and listen to me.” I then went on, beginning with the rise and progress of\nthe primitive religions, and coming down to the various religions of the present\ntime, during which time I labored to show Queequeg that all these Lents,\nRamadans, and prolonged ham-squattings in cold, cheerless rooms were stark\nnonsense; bad for the health; useless for the soul; opposed, in short, to the\nobvious laws of Hygiene and common sense. I told him, too, that he being in\nother things such an extremely sensible and sagacious savage, it pained me, very\nbadly pained me, to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous\nRamadan of his. Besides, argued I, fasting makes the body cave in; hence the\nspirit caves in; and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be\nhalf-starved. This is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish such\nmelancholy notions about their hereafters. In one word, Queequeg, said I, rather\ndigressively; hell is an idea first born on an undigested apple-dumpling; and\nsince then perpetuated through the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans.\n\nI then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with dyspepsia;\nexpressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it in. He said no; only\nupon one memorable occasion. It was after a great feast given by his father the\nking, on the gaining of a great battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been\nkilled by about two o’clock in the afternoon, and all cooked and eaten that very\nevening.\n\n“No more, Queequeg,” said I, shuddering; “that will do;” for I knew the\ninferences without his further hinting them. I had seen a sailor who had visited\nthat very island, and he told me that it was the custom, when a great battle had\nbeen gained there, to barbecue all the slain in the yard or garden of the\nvictor; and then, one by one, they were placed in great wooden trenchers, and\ngarnished round like a pilau, with breadfruit and cocoanuts; and with some\nparsley in their mouths, were sent round with the victor’s compliments to all\nhis friends, just as though these presents were so many Christmas turkeys.\n\nAfter all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much impression\nupon Queequeg. Because, in the first place, he somehow seemed dull of hearing on\nthat important subject, unless considered from his own point of view; and, in\nthe second place, he did not more than one third understand me, couch my ideas\nsimply as I would; and, finally, he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more\nabout the true religion than I did. He looked at me with a sort of condescending\nconcern and compassion, as though he thought it a great pity that such a\nsensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety.\n\nAt last we rose and dressed; and Queequeg, taking a prodigiously hearty\nbreakfast of chowders of all sorts, so that the landlady should not make much\nprofit by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied out to board the Pequod, sauntering\nalong, and picking our teeth with halibut bones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 18. HIS MARK.\n\nAs we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship, Queequeg carrying\nhis harpoon, Captain Peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us from his wigwam,\nsaying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal, and furthermore announcing\nthat he let no cannibals on board that craft, unless they previously produced\ntheir papers.\n\n“What do you mean by that, Captain Peleg?” said I, now jumping on the bulwarks,\nand leaving my comrade standing on the wharf.\n\n“I mean,” he replied, “he must show his papers.”\n\n“Yes,” said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice, sticking his head from behind\nPeleg’s, out of the wigwam. “He must show that he’s converted. Son of darkness,”\nhe added, turning to Queequeg, “art thou at present in communion with any\nChristian church?”\n\n“Why,” said I, “he’s a member of the first Congregational Church.” Here be it\nsaid, that many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucket ships at last come to be\nconverted into the churches.\n\n“First Congregational Church,” cried Bildad, “what! that worships in Deacon\nDeuteronomy Coleman’s meeting-house?” and so saying, taking out his spectacles,\nhe rubbed them with his great yellow bandana handkerchief, and putting them on\nvery carefully, came out of the wigwam, and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks,\ntook a good long look at Queequeg.\n\n“How long hath he been a member?” he then said, turning to me; “not very long, I\nrather guess, young man.”\n\n“No,” said Peleg, “and he hasn’t been baptized right either, or it would have\nwashed some of that devil’s blue off his face.”\n\n“Do tell, now,” cried Bildad, “is this Philistine a regular member of Deacon\nDeuteronomy’s meeting? I never saw him going there, and I pass it every Lord’s\nday.”\n\n“I don’t know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting,” said I; “all I\nknow is, that Queequeg here is a born member of the First Congregational Church.\nHe is a deacon himself, Queequeg is.”\n\n“Young man,” said Bildad sternly, “thou art skylarking with me—explain thyself,\nthou young Hittite. What church dost thee mean? answer me.”\n\nFinding myself thus hard pushed, I replied. “I mean, sir, the same ancient\nCatholic Church to which you and I, and Captain Peleg there, and Queequeg here,\nand all of us, and every mother’s son and soul of us belong; the great and\neverlasting First Congregation of this whole worshipping world; we all belong to\nthat; only some of us cherish some queer crotchets no ways touching the grand\nbelief; in that we all join hands.”\n\n“Splice, thou mean’st splice hands,” cried Peleg, drawing nearer. “Young man,\nyou’d better ship for a missionary, instead of a fore-mast hand; I never heard a\nbetter sermon. Deacon Deuteronomy—why Father Mapple himself couldn’t beat it,\nand he’s reckoned something. Come aboard, come aboard; never mind about the\npapers. I say, tell Quohog there—what’s that you call him? tell Quohog to step\nalong. By the great anchor, what a harpoon he’s got there! looks like good stuff\nthat; and he handles it about right. I say, Quohog, or whatever your name is,\ndid you ever stand in the head of a whale-boat? did you ever strike a fish?”\n\nWithout saying a word, Queequeg, in his wild sort of way, jumped upon the\nbulwarks, from thence into the bows of one of the whale-boats hanging to the\nside; and then bracing his left knee, and poising his harpoon, cried out in some\nsuch way as this:—\n\n“Cap’ain, you see him small drop tar on water dere? You see him? well, spose him\none whale eye, well, den!” and taking sharp aim at it, he darted the iron right\nover old Bildad’s broad brim, clean across the ship’s decks, and struck the\nglistening tar spot out of sight.\n\n“Now,” said Queequeg, quietly hauling in the line, “spos-ee him whale-e eye;\nwhy, dad whale dead.”\n\n“Quick, Bildad,” said Peleg, his partner, who, aghast at the close vicinity of\nthe flying harpoon, had retreated towards the cabin gangway. “Quick, I say, you\nBildad, and get the ship’s papers. We must have Hedgehog there, I mean Quohog,\nin one of our boats. Look ye, Quohog, we’ll give ye the ninetieth lay, and\nthat’s more than ever was given a harpooneer yet out of Nantucket.”\n\nSo down we went into the cabin, and to my great joy Queequeg was soon enrolled\namong the same ship’s company to which I myself belonged.\n\nWhen all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got everything ready for signing,\nhe turned to me and said, “I guess, Quohog there don’t know how to write, does\nhe? I say, Quohog, blast ye! dost thou sign thy name or make thy mark?”\n\nBut at this question, Queequeg, who had twice or thrice before taken part in\nsimilar ceremonies, looked no ways abashed; but taking the offered pen, copied\nupon the paper, in the proper place, an exact counterpart of a queer round\nfigure which was tattooed upon his arm; so that through Captain Peleg’s\nobstinate mistake touching his appellative, it stood something like this:—\n\nQuohog. his X mark.\n\nMeanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing Queequeg, and at\nlast rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his broad-skirted drab\ncoat, took out a bundle of tracts, and selecting one entitled “The Latter Day\nComing; or No Time to Lose,” placed it in Queequeg’s hands, and then grasping\nthem and the book with both his, looked earnestly into his eyes, and said, “Son\nof darkness, I must do my duty by thee; I am part owner of this ship, and feel\nconcerned for the souls of all its crew; if thou still clingest to thy Pagan\nways, which I sadly fear, I beseech thee, remain not for aye a Belial bondsman.\nSpurn the idol Bell, and the hideous dragon; turn from the wrath to come; mind\nthine eye, I say; oh! goodness gracious! steer clear of the fiery pit!”\n\nSomething of the salt sea yet lingered in old Bildad’s language, heterogeneously\nmixed with Scriptural and domestic phrases.\n\n“Avast there, avast there, Bildad, avast now spoiling our harpooneer,” cried\nPeleg. “Pious harpooneers never make good voyagers—it takes the shark out of\n’em; no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint pretty sharkish. There was young\nNat Swaine, once the bravest boat-header out of all Nantucket and the Vineyard;\nhe joined the meeting, and never came to good. He got so frightened about his\nplaguy soul, that he shrinked and sheered away from whales, for fear of\nafter-claps, in case he got stove and went to Davy Jones.”\n\n“Peleg! Peleg!” said Bildad, lifting his eyes and hands, “thou thyself, as I\nmyself, hast seen many a perilous time; thou knowest, Peleg, what it is to have\nthe fear of death; how, then, can’st thou prate in this ungodly guise. Thou\nbeliest thine own heart, Peleg. Tell me, when this same Pequod here had her\nthree masts overboard in that typhoon on Japan, that same voyage when thou went\nmate with Captain Ahab, did’st thou not think of Death and the Judgment then?”\n\n“Hear him, hear him now,” cried Peleg, marching across the cabin, and thrusting\nhis hands far down into his pockets,—“hear him, all of ye. Think of that! When\nevery moment we thought the ship would sink! Death and the Judgment then? What?\nWith all three masts making such an everlasting thundering against the side; and\nevery sea breaking over us, fore and aft. Think of Death and the Judgment then?\nNo! no time to think about Death then. Life was what Captain Ahab and I was\nthinking of; and how to save all hands—how to rig jury-masts—how to get into the\nnearest port; that was what I was thinking of.”\n\nBildad said no more, but buttoning up his coat, stalked on deck, where we\nfollowed him. There he stood, very quietly overlooking some sailmakers who were\nmending a top-sail in the waist. Now and then he stooped to pick up a patch, or\nsave an end of tarred twine, which otherwise might have been wasted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 19. THE PROPHET.\n\n“Shipmates, have ye shipped in that ship?”\n\nQueequeg and I had just left the Pequod, and were sauntering away from the\nwater, for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts, when the above words\nwere put to us by a stranger, who, pausing before us, levelled his massive\nforefinger at the vessel in question. He was but shabbily apparelled in faded\njacket and patched trowsers; a rag of a black handkerchief investing his neck. A\nconfluent small-pox had in all directions flowed over his face, and left it like\nthe complicated ribbed bed of a torrent, when the rushing waters have been dried\nup.\n\n“Have ye shipped in her?” he repeated.\n\n“You mean the ship Pequod, I suppose,” said I, trying to gain a little more time\nfor an uninterrupted look at him.\n\n“Aye, the Pequod—that ship there,” he said, drawing back his whole arm, and then\nrapidly shoving it straight out from him, with the fixed bayonet of his pointed\nfinger darted full at the object.\n\n“Yes,” said I, “we have just signed the articles.”\n\n“Anything down there about your souls?”\n\n“About what?”\n\n“Oh, perhaps you hav’n’t got any,” he said quickly. “No matter though, I know\nmany chaps that hav’n’t got any,—good luck to ’em; and they are all the better\noff for it. A soul’s a sort of a fifth wheel to a wagon.”\n\n“What are you jabbering about, shipmate?” said I.\n\n“He’s got enough, though, to make up for all deficiencies of that sort in other\nchaps,” abruptly said the stranger, placing a nervous emphasis upon the word he.\n\n“Queequeg,” said I, “let’s go; this fellow has broken loose from somewhere; he’s\ntalking about something and somebody we don’t know.”\n\n“Stop!” cried the stranger. “Ye said true—ye hav’n’t seen Old Thunder yet, have\nye?”\n\n“Who’s Old Thunder?” said I, again riveted with the insane earnestness of his\nmanner.\n\n“Captain Ahab.”\n\n“What! the captain of our ship, the Pequod?”\n\n“Aye, among some of us old sailor chaps, he goes by that name. Ye hav’n’t seen\nhim yet, have ye?”\n\n“No, we hav’n’t. He’s sick they say, but is getting better, and will be all\nright again before long.”\n\n“All right again before long!” laughed the stranger, with a solemnly derisive\nsort of laugh. “Look ye; when Captain Ahab is all right, then this left arm of\nmine will be all right; not before.”\n\n“What do you know about him?”\n\n“What did they tell you about him? Say that!”\n\n“They didn’t tell much of anything about him; only I’ve heard that he’s a good\nwhale-hunter, and a good captain to his crew.”\n\n“That’s true, that’s true—yes, both true enough. But you must jump when he gives\nan order. Step and growl; growl and go—that’s the word with Captain Ahab. But\nnothing about that thing that happened to him off Cape Horn, long ago, when he\nlay like dead for three days and nights; nothing about that deadly skrimmage\nwith the Spaniard afore the altar in Santa?—heard nothing about that, eh?\nNothing about the silver calabash he spat into? And nothing about his losing his\nleg last voyage, according to the prophecy. Didn’t ye hear a word about them\nmatters and something more, eh? No, I don’t think ye did; how could ye? Who\nknows it? Not all Nantucket, I guess. But hows’ever, mayhap, ye’ve heard tell\nabout the leg, and how he lost it; aye, ye have heard of that, I dare say. Oh\nyes, that every one knows a’most—I mean they know he’s only one leg; and that a\nparmacetti took the other off.”\n\n“My friend,” said I, “what all this gibberish of yours is about, I don’t know,\nand I don’t much care; for it seems to me that you must be a little damaged in\nthe head. But if you are speaking of Captain Ahab, of that ship there, the\nPequod, then let me tell you, that I know all about the loss of his leg.”\n\n“All about it, eh—sure you do?—all?”\n\n“Pretty sure.”\n\nWith finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod, the beggar-like stranger\nstood a moment, as if in a troubled reverie; then starting a little, turned and\nsaid:—“Ye’ve shipped, have ye? Names down on the papers? Well, well, what’s\nsigned, is signed; and what’s to be, will be; and then again, perhaps it won’t\nbe, after all. Anyhow, it’s all fixed and arranged a’ready; and some sailors or\nother must go with him, I suppose; as well these as any other men, God pity ’em!\nMorning to ye, shipmates, morning; the ineffable heavens bless ye; I’m sorry I\nstopped ye.”\n\n“Look here, friend,” said I, “if you have anything important to tell us, out\nwith it; but if you are only trying to bamboozle us, you are mistaken in your\ngame; that’s all I have to say.”\n\n“And it’s said very well, and I like to hear a chap talk up that way; you are\njust the man for him—the likes of ye. Morning to ye, shipmates, morning! Oh!\nwhen ye get there, tell ’em I’ve concluded not to make one of ’em.”\n\n“Ah, my dear fellow, you can’t fool us that way—you can’t fool us. It is the\neasiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a great secret in\nhim.”\n\n“Morning to ye, shipmates, morning.”\n\n“Morning it is,” said I. “Come along, Queequeg, let’s leave this crazy man. But\nstop, tell me your name, will you?”\n\n“Elijah.”\n\nElijah! thought I, and we walked away, both commenting, after each other’s\nfashion, upon this ragged old sailor; and agreed that he was nothing but a\nhumbug, trying to be a bugbear. But we had not gone perhaps above a hundred\nyards, when chancing to turn a corner, and looking back as I did so, who should\nbe seen but Elijah following us, though at a distance. Somehow, the sight of him\nstruck me so, that I said nothing to Queequeg of his being behind, but passed on\nwith my comrade, anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner\nthat we did. He did; and then it seemed to me that he was dogging us, but with\nwhat intent I could not for the life of me imagine. This circumstance, coupled\nwith his ambiguous, half-hinting, half-revealing, shrouded sort of talk, now\nbegat in me all kinds of vague wonderments and half-apprehensions, and all\nconnected with the Pequod; and Captain Ahab; and the leg he had lost; and the\nCape Horn fit; and the silver calabash; and what Captain Peleg had said of him,\nwhen I left the ship the day previous; and the prediction of the squaw Tistig;\nand the voyage we had bound ourselves to sail; and a hundred other shadowy\nthings.\n\nI was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah was really dogging\nus or not, and with that intent crossed the way with Queequeg, and on that side\nof it retraced our steps. But Elijah passed on, without seeming to notice us.\nThis relieved me; and once more, and finally as it seemed to me, I pronounced\nhim in my heart, a humbug.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 20. ALL ASTIR.\n\nA day or two passed, and there was great activity aboard the Pequod. Not only\nwere the old sails being mended, but new sails were coming on board, and bolts\nof canvas, and coils of rigging; in short, everything betokened that the ship’s\npreparations were hurrying to a close. Captain Peleg seldom or never went\nashore, but sat in his wigwam keeping a sharp look-out upon the hands: Bildad\ndid all the purchasing and providing at the stores; and the men employed in the\nhold and on the rigging were working till long after night-fall.\n\nOn the day following Queequeg’s signing the articles, word was given at all the\ninns where the ship’s company were stopping, that their chests must be on board\nbefore night, for there was no telling how soon the vessel might be sailing. So\nQueequeg and I got down our traps, resolving, however, to sleep ashore till the\nlast. But it seems they always give very long notice in these cases, and the\nship did not sail for several days. But no wonder; there was a good deal to be\ndone, and there is no telling how many things to be thought of, before the\nPequod was fully equipped.\n\nEvery one knows what a multitude of things—beds, sauce-pans, knives and forks,\nshovels and tongs, napkins, nut-crackers, and what not, are indispensable to the\nbusiness of housekeeping. Just so with whaling, which necessitates a\nthree-years’ housekeeping upon the wide ocean, far from all grocers,\ncostermongers, doctors, bakers, and bankers. And though this also holds true of\nmerchant vessels, yet not by any means to the same extent as with whalemen. For\nbesides the great length of the whaling voyage, the numerous articles peculiar\nto the prosecution of the fishery, and the impossibility of replacing them at\nthe remote harbors usually frequented, it must be remembered, that of all ships,\nwhaling vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all kinds, and especially\nto the destruction and loss of the very things upon which the success of the\nvoyage most depends. Hence, the spare boats, spare spars, and spare lines and\nharpoons, and spare everythings, almost, but a spare Captain and duplicate ship.\n\nAt the period of our arrival at the Island, the heaviest storage of the Pequod\nhad been almost completed; comprising her beef, bread, water, fuel, and iron\nhoops and staves. But, as before hinted, for some time there was a continual\nfetching and carrying on board of divers odds and ends of things, both large and\nsmall.\n\nChief among those who did this fetching and carrying was Captain Bildad’s\nsister, a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable spirit, but\nwithal very kindhearted, who seemed resolved that, if she could help it, nothing\nshould be found wanting in the Pequod, after once fairly getting to sea. At one\ntime she would come on board with a jar of pickles for the steward’s pantry;\nanother time with a bunch of quills for the chief mate’s desk, where he kept his\nlog; a third time with a roll of flannel for the small of some one’s rheumatic\nback. Never did any woman better deserve her name, which was Charity—Aunt\nCharity, as everybody called her. And like a sister of charity did this\ncharitable Aunt Charity bustle about hither and thither, ready to turn her hand\nand heart to anything that promised to yield safety, comfort, and consolation to\nall on board a ship in which her beloved brother Bildad was concerned, and in\nwhich she herself owned a score or two of well-saved dollars.\n\nBut it was startling to see this excellent hearted Quakeress coming on board, as\nshe did the last day, with a long oil-ladle in one hand, and a still longer\nwhaling lance in the other. Nor was Bildad himself nor Captain Peleg at all\nbackward. As for Bildad, he carried about with him a long list of the articles\nneeded, and at every fresh arrival, down went his mark opposite that article\nupon the paper. Every once in a while Peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone\nden, roaring at the men down the hatchways, roaring up to the riggers at the\nmast-head, and then concluded by roaring back into his wigwam.\n\nDuring these days of preparation, Queequeg and I often visited the craft, and as\noften I asked about Captain Ahab, and how he was, and when he was going to come\non board his ship. To these questions they would answer, that he was getting\nbetter and better, and was expected aboard every day; meantime, the two\ncaptains, Peleg and Bildad, could attend to everything necessary to fit the\nvessel for the voyage. If I had been downright honest with myself, I would have\nseen very plainly in my heart that I did but half fancy being committed this way\nto so long a voyage, without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the\nabsolute dictator of it, so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open sea. But\nwhen a man suspects any wrong, it sometimes happens that if he be already\ninvolved in the matter, he insensibly strives to cover up his suspicions even\nfrom himself. And much this way it was with me. I said nothing, and tried to\nthink nothing.\n\nAt last it was given out that some time next day the ship would certainly sail.\nSo next morning, Queequeg and I took a very early start.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 21. GOING ABOARD.\n\nIt was nearly six o’clock, but only grey imperfect misty dawn, when we drew nigh\nthe wharf.\n\n“There are some sailors running ahead there, if I see right,” said I to\nQueequeg, “it can’t be shadows; she’s off by sunrise, I guess; come on!”\n\n“Avast!” cried a voice, whose owner at the same time coming close behind us,\nlaid a hand upon both our shoulders, and then insinuating himself between us,\nstood stooping forward a little, in the uncertain twilight, strangely peering\nfrom Queequeg to me. It was Elijah.\n\n“Going aboard?”\n\n“Hands off, will you,” said I.\n\n“Lookee here,” said Queequeg, shaking himself, “go ’way!”\n\n“Ain’t going aboard, then?”\n\n“Yes, we are,” said I, “but what business is that of yours? Do you know, Mr.\nElijah, that I consider you a little impertinent?”\n\n“No, no, no; I wasn’t aware of that,” said Elijah, slowly and wonderingly\nlooking from me to Queequeg, with the most unaccountable glances.\n\n“Elijah,” said I, “you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing. We are going\nto the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and would prefer not to be detained.”\n\n“Ye be, be ye? Coming back afore breakfast?”\n\n“He’s cracked, Queequeg,” said I, “come on.”\n\n“Holloa!” cried stationary Elijah, hailing us when we had removed a few paces.\n\n“Never mind him,” said I, “Queequeg, come on.”\n\nBut he stole up to us again, and suddenly clapping his hand on my shoulder,\nsaid—“Did ye see anything looking like men going towards that ship a while ago?”\n\nStruck by this plain matter-of-fact question, I answered, saying, “Yes, I\nthought I did see four or five men; but it was too dim to be sure.”\n\n“Very dim, very dim,” said Elijah. “Morning to ye.”\n\nOnce more we quitted him; but once more he came softly after us; and touching my\nshoulder again, said, “See if you can find ’em now, will ye?\n\n“Find who?”\n\n“Morning to ye! morning to ye!” he rejoined, again moving off. “Oh! I was going\nto warn ye against—but never mind, never mind—it’s all one, all in the family\ntoo;—sharp frost this morning, ain’t it? Good-bye to ye. Shan’t see ye again\nvery soon, I guess; unless it’s before the Grand Jury.” And with these cracked\nwords he finally departed, leaving me, for the moment, in no small wonderment at\nhis frantic impudence.\n\nAt last, stepping on board the Pequod, we found everything in profound quiet,\nnot a soul moving. The cabin entrance was locked within; the hatches were all\non, and lumbered with coils of rigging. Going forward to the forecastle, we\nfound the slide of the scuttle open. Seeing a light, we went down, and found\nonly an old rigger there, wrapped in a tattered pea-jacket. He was thrown at\nwhole length upon two chests, his face downwards and inclosed in his folded\narms. The profoundest slumber slept upon him.\n\n“Those sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to?” said I, looking\ndubiously at the sleeper. But it seemed that, when on the wharf, Queequeg had\nnot at all noticed what I now alluded to; hence I would have thought myself to\nhave been optically deceived in that matter, were it not for Elijah’s otherwise\ninexplicable question. But I beat the thing down; and again marking the sleeper,\njocularly hinted to Queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body;\ntelling him to establish himself accordingly. He put his hand upon the sleeper’s\nrear, as though feeling if it was soft enough; and then, without more ado, sat\nquietly down there.\n\n“Gracious! Queequeg, don’t sit there,” said I.\n\n“Oh! perry dood seat,” said Queequeg, “my country way; won’t hurt him face.”\n\n“Face!” said I, “call that his face? very benevolent countenance then; but how\nhard he breathes, he’s heaving himself; get off, Queequeg, you are heavy, it’s\ngrinding the face of the poor. Get off, Queequeg! Look, he’ll twitch you off\nsoon. I wonder he don’t wake.”\n\nQueequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper, and lighted his\ntomahawk pipe. I sat at the feet. We kept the pipe passing over the sleeper,\nfrom one to the other. Meanwhile, upon questioning him in his broken fashion,\nQueequeg gave me to understand that, in his land, owing to the absence of\nsettees and sofas of all sorts, the king, chiefs, and great people generally,\nwere in the custom of fattening some of the lower orders for ottomans; and to\nfurnish a house comfortably in that respect, you had only to buy up eight or ten\nlazy fellows, and lay them round in the piers and alcoves. Besides, it was very\nconvenient on an excursion; much better than those garden-chairs which are\nconvertible into walking-sticks; upon occasion, a chief calling his attendant,\nand desiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree, perhaps in\nsome damp marshy place.\n\nWhile narrating these things, every time Queequeg received the tomahawk from me,\nhe flourished the hatchet-side of it over the sleeper’s head.\n\n“What’s that for, Queequeg?”\n\n“Perry easy, kill-e; oh! perry easy!”\n\nHe was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk-pipe, which, it\nseemed, had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed his soul, when we\nwere directly attracted to the sleeping rigger. The strong vapor now completely\nfilling the contracted hole, it began to tell upon him. He breathed with a sort\nof muffledness; then seemed troubled in the nose; then revolved over once or\ntwice; then sat up and rubbed his eyes.\n\n“Holloa!” he breathed at last, “who be ye smokers?”\n\n“Shipped men,” answered I, “when does she sail?”\n\n“Aye, aye, ye are going in her, be ye? She sails to-day. The Captain came aboard\nlast night.”\n\n“What Captain?—Ahab?”\n\n“Who but him indeed?”\n\nI was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab, when we heard a\nnoise on deck.\n\n“Holloa! Starbuck’s astir,” said the rigger. “He’s a lively chief mate, that;\ngood man, and a pious; but all alive now, I must turn to.” And so saying he went\non deck, and we followed.\n\nIt was now clear sunrise. Soon the crew came on board in twos and threes; the\nriggers bestirred themselves; the mates were actively engaged; and several of\nthe shore people were busy in bringing various last things on board. Meanwhile\nCaptain Ahab remained invisibly enshrined within his cabin.\n\n"},{"title":"Test Section Title","content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 109. AHAB AND STARBUCK IN THE CABIN.\n\nAccording to usage they were pumping the ship next morning; and lo! no\ninconsiderable oil came up with the water; the casks below must have sprung a\nbad leak. Much concern was shown; and Starbuck went down into the cabin to\nreport this unfavourable affair.*\n\n*In Sperm-whalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board, it is a\nregular semi-weekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold, and drench the casks\nwith sea-water; which afterwards, at varying intervals, is removed by the ship’s\npumps. Hereby the casks are sought to be kept damply tight; while by the changed\ncharacter of the withdrawn water, the mariners readily detect any serious\nleakage in the precious cargo.\n\nNow, from the South and West the Pequod was drawing nigh to Formosa and the\nBashee Isles, between which lies one of the tropical outlets from the China\nwaters into the Pacific. And so Starbuck found Ahab with a general chart of the\noriental archipelagoes spread before him; and another separate one representing\nthe long eastern coasts of the Japanese islands—Niphon, Matsmai, and Sikoke.\nWith his snow-white new ivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his table,\nand with a long pruning-hook of a jack-knife in his hand, the wondrous old man,\nwith his back to the gangway door, was wrinkling his brow, and tracing his old\ncourses again.\n\n“Who’s there?” hearing the footstep at the door, but not turning round to it.\n“On deck! Begone!”\n\n“Captain Ahab mistakes; it is I. The oil in the hold is leaking, sir. We must up\nBurtons and break out.”\n\n“Up Burtons and break out? Now that we are nearing Japan; heave-to here for a\nweek to tinker a parcel of old hoops?”\n\n“Either do that, sir, or waste in one day more oil than we may make good in a\nyear. What we come twenty thousand miles to get is worth saving, sir.”\n\n“So it is, so it is; if we get it.”\n\n“I was speaking of the oil in the hold, sir.”\n\n“And I was not speaking or thinking of that at all. Begone! Let it leak! I’m all\naleak myself. Aye! leaks in leaks! not only full of leaky casks, but those leaky\ncasks are in a leaky ship; and that’s a far worse plight than the Pequod’s, man.\nYet I don’t stop to plug my leak; for who can find it in the deep-loaded hull;\nor how hope to plug it, even if found, in this life’s howling gale? Starbuck!\nI’ll not have the Burtons hoisted.”\n\n“What will the owners say, sir?”\n\n“Let the owners stand on Nantucket beach and outyell the Typhoons. What cares\nAhab? Owners, owners? Thou art always prating to me, Starbuck, about those\nmiserly owners, as if the owners were my conscience. But look ye, the only real\nowner of anything is its commander; and hark ye, my conscience is in this ship’s\nkeel.—On deck!”\n\n“Captain Ahab,” said the reddening mate, moving further into the cabin, with a\ndaring so strangely respectful and cautious that it almost seemed not only every\nway seeking to avoid the slightest outward manifestation of itself, but within\nalso seemed more than half distrustful of itself; “A better man than I might\nwell pass over in thee what he would quickly enough resent in a younger man;\naye, and in a happier, Captain Ahab.”\n\n“Devils! Dost thou then so much as dare to critically think of me?—On deck!”\n\n“Nay, sir, not yet; I do entreat. And I do dare, sir—to be forbearing! Shall we\nnot understand each other better than hitherto, Captain Ahab?”\n\nAhab seized a loaded musket from the rack (forming part of most South-Sea-men’s\ncabin furniture), and pointing it towards Starbuck, exclaimed: “There is one God\nthat is Lord over the earth, and one Captain that is lord over the Pequod.—On\ndeck!”\n\nFor an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate, and his fiery cheeks, you would\nhave almost thought that he had really received the blaze of the levelled tube.\nBut, mastering his emotion, he half calmly rose, and as he quitted the cabin,\npaused for an instant and said: “Thou hast outraged, not insulted me, sir; but\nfor that I ask thee not to beware of Starbuck; thou wouldst but laugh; but let\nAhab beware of Ahab; beware of thyself, old man.”\n\n“He waxes brave, but nevertheless obeys; most careful bravery that!” murmured\nAhab, as Starbuck disappeared. “What’s that he said—Ahab beware of Ahab—there’s\nsomething there!” Then unconsciously using the musket for a staff, with an iron\nbrow he paced to and fro in the little cabin; but presently the thick plaits of\nhis forehead relaxed, and returning the gun to the rack, he went to the deck.\n\n“Thou art but too good a fellow, Starbuck,” he said lowly to the mate; then\nraising his voice to the crew: “Furl the t’gallant-sails, and close-reef the\ntop-sails, fore and aft; back the main-yard; up Burton, and break out in the\nmain-hold.”\n\nIt were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was, that as respecting Starbuck,\nAhab thus acted. It may have been a flash of honesty in him; or mere prudential\npolicy which, under the circumstance, imperiously forbade the slightest symptom\nof open disaffection, however transient, in the important chief officer of his\nship. However it was, his orders were executed; and the Burtons were hoisted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 110. QUEEQUEG IN HIS COFFIN.\n\nUpon searching, it was found that the casks last struck into the hold were\nperfectly sound, and that the leak must be further off. So, it being calm\nweather, they broke out deeper and deeper, disturbing the slumbers of the huge\nground-tier butts; and from that black midnight sending those gigantic moles\ninto the daylight above. So deep did they go; and so ancient, and corroded, and\nweedy the aspect of the lowermost puncheons, that you almost looked next for\nsome mouldy corner-stone cask containing coins of Captain Noah, with copies of\nthe posted placards, vainly warning the infatuated old world from the flood.\nTierce after tierce, too, of water, and bread, and beef, and shooks of staves,\nand iron bundles of hoops, were hoisted out, till at last the piled decks were\nhard to get about; and the hollow hull echoed under foot, as if you were\ntreading over empty catacombs, and reeled and rolled in the sea like an\nair-freighted demijohn. Top-heavy was the ship as a dinnerless student with all\nAristotle in his head. Well was it that the Typhoons did not visit them then.\n\nNow, at this time it was that my poor pagan companion, and fast bosom-friend,\nQueequeg, was seized with a fever, which brought him nigh to his endless end.\n\nBe it said, that in this vocation of whaling, sinecures are unknown; dignity and\ndanger go hand in hand; till you get to be Captain, the higher you rise the\nharder you toil. So with poor Queequeg, who, as harpooneer, must not only face\nall the rage of the living whale, but—as we have elsewhere seen—mount his dead\nback in a rolling sea; and finally descend into the gloom of the hold, and\nbitterly sweating all day in that subterraneous confinement, resolutely\nmanhandle the clumsiest casks and see to their stowage. To be short, among\nwhalemen, the harpooneers are the holders, so called.\n\nPoor Queequeg! when the ship was about half disembowelled, you should have\nstooped over the hatchway, and peered down upon him there; where, stripped to\nhis woollen drawers, the tattooed savage was crawling about amid that dampness\nand slime, like a green spotted lizard at the bottom of a well. And a well, or\nan ice-house, it somehow proved to him, poor pagan; where, strange to say, for\nall the heat of his sweatings, he caught a terrible chill which lapsed into a\nfever; and at last, after some days’ suffering, laid him in his hammock, close\nto the very sill of the door of death. How he wasted and wasted away in those\nfew long-lingering days, till there seemed but little left of him but his frame\nand tattooing. But as all else in him thinned, and his cheek-bones grew sharper,\nhis eyes, nevertheless, seemed growing fuller and fuller; they became of a\nstrange softness of lustre; and mildly but deeply looked out at you there from\nhis sickness, a wondrous testimony to that immortal health in him which could\nnot die, or be weakened. And like circles on the water, which, as they grow\nfainter, expand; so his eyes seemed rounding and rounding, like the rings of\nEternity. An awe that cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the\nside of this waning savage, and saw as strange things in his face, as any beheld\nwho were bystanders when Zoroaster died. For whatever is truly wondrous and\nfearful in man, never yet was put into words or books. And the drawing near of\nDeath, which alike levels all, alike impresses all with a last revelation, which\nonly an author from the dead could adequately tell. So that—let us say it\nagain—no dying Chaldee or Greek had higher and holier thoughts than those, whose\nmysterious shades you saw creeping over the face of poor Queequeg, as he quietly\nlay in his swaying hammock, and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to his\nfinal rest, and the ocean’s invisible flood-tide lifted him higher and higher\ntowards his destined heaven.\n\nNot a man of the crew but gave him up; and, as for Queequeg himself, what he\nthought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour he asked. He called\none to him in the grey morning watch, when the day was just breaking, and taking\nhis hand, said that while in Nantucket he had chanced to see certain little\ncanoes of dark wood, like the rich war-wood of his native isle; and upon\ninquiry, he had learned that all whalemen who died in Nantucket, were laid in\nthose same dark canoes, and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased\nhim; for it was not unlike the custom of his own race, who, after embalming a\ndead warrior, stretched him out in his canoe, and so left him to be floated away\nto the starry archipelagoes; for not only do they believe that the stars are\nisles, but that far beyond all visible horizons, their own mild, uncontinented\nseas, interflow with the blue heavens; and so form the white breakers of the\nmilky way. He added, that he shuddered at the thought of being buried in his\nhammock, according to the usual sea-custom, tossed like something vile to the\ndeath-devouring sharks. No: he desired a canoe like those of Nantucket, all the\nmore congenial to him, being a whaleman, that like a whale-boat these\ncoffin-canoes were without a keel; though that involved but uncertain steering,\nand much lee-way adown the dim ages.\n\nNow, when this strange circumstance was made known aft, the carpenter was at\nonce commanded to do Queequeg’s bidding, whatever it might include. There was\nsome heathenish, coffin-coloured old lumber aboard, which, upon a long previous\nvoyage, had been cut from the aboriginal groves of the Lackaday islands, and\nfrom these dark planks the coffin was recommended to be made. No sooner was the\ncarpenter apprised of the order, than taking his rule, he forthwith with all the\nindifferent promptitude of his character, proceeded into the forecastle and took\nQueequeg’s measure with great accuracy, regularly chalking Queequeg’s person as\nhe shifted the rule.\n\n“Ah! poor fellow! he’ll have to die now,” ejaculated the Long Island sailor.\n\nGoing to his vice-bench, the carpenter for convenience sake and general\nreference, now transferringly measured on it the exact length the coffin was to\nbe, and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two notches at its\nextremities. This done, he marshalled the planks and his tools, and to work.\n\nWhen the last nail was driven, and the lid duly planed and fitted, he lightly\nshouldered the coffin and went forward with it, inquiring whether they were\nready for it yet in that direction.\n\nOverhearing the indignant but half-humorous cries with which the people on deck\nbegan to drive the coffin away, Queequeg, to every one’s consternation,\ncommanded that the thing should be instantly brought to him, nor was there any\ndenying him; seeing that, of all mortals, some dying men are the most\ntyrannical; and certainly, since they will shortly trouble us so little for\nevermore, the poor fellows ought to be indulged.\n\nLeaning over in his hammock, Queequeg long regarded the coffin with an attentive\neye. He then called for his harpoon, had the wooden stock drawn from it, and\nthen had the iron part placed in the coffin along with one of the paddles of his\nboat. All by his own request, also, biscuits were then ranged round the sides\nwithin: a flask of fresh water was placed at the head, and a small bag of woody\nearth scraped up in the hold at the foot; and a piece of sail-cloth being rolled\nup for a pillow, Queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed, that he\nmight make trial of its comforts, if any it had. He lay without moving a few\nminutes, then told one to go to his bag and bring out his little god, Yojo. Then\ncrossing his arms on his breast with Yojo between, he called for the coffin lid\n(hatch he called it) to be placed over him. The head part turned over with a\nleather hinge, and there lay Queequeg in his coffin with little but his composed\ncountenance in view. “Rarmai” (it will do; it is easy), he murmured at last, and\nsigned to be replaced in his hammock.\n\nBut ere this was done, Pip, who had been slily hovering near by all this while,\ndrew nigh to him where he lay, and with soft sobbings, took him by the hand; in\nthe other, holding his tambourine.\n\n“Poor rover! will ye never have done with all this weary roving? where go ye\nnow? But if the currents carry ye to those sweet Antilles where the beaches are\nonly beat with water-lilies, will ye do one little errand for me? Seek out one\nPip, who’s now been missing long: I think he’s in those far Antilles. If ye find\nhim, then comfort him; for he must be very sad; for look! he’s left his\ntambourine behind;—I found it. Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! Now, Queequeg, die; and I’ll\nbeat ye your dying march.”\n\n“I have heard,” murmured Starbuck, gazing down the scuttle, “that in violent\nfevers, men, all ignorance, have talked in ancient tongues; and that when the\nmystery is probed, it turns out always that in their wholly forgotten childhood\nthose ancient tongues had been really spoken in their hearing by some lofty\nscholars. So, to my fond faith, poor Pip, in this strange sweetness of his\nlunacy, brings heavenly vouchers of all our heavenly homes. Where learned he\nthat, but there?—Hark! he speaks again: but more wildly now.”\n\n“Form two and two! Let’s make a General of him! Ho, where’s his harpoon? Lay it\nacross here.—Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! huzza! Oh for a game cock now to sit upon his\nhead and crow! Queequeg dies game!—mind ye that; Queequeg dies game!—take ye\ngood heed of that; Queequeg dies game! I say; game, game, game! but base little\nPip, he died a coward; died all a’shiver;—out upon Pip! Hark ye; if ye find Pip,\ntell all the Antilles he’s a runaway; a coward, a coward, a coward! Tell them he\njumped from a whale-boat! I’d never beat my tambourine over base Pip, and hail\nhim General, if he were once more dying here. No, no! shame upon all\ncowards—shame upon them! Let ’em go drown like Pip, that jumped from a\nwhale-boat. Shame! shame!”\n\nDuring all this, Queequeg lay with closed eyes, as if in a dream. Pip was led\naway, and the sick man was replaced in his hammock.\n\nBut now that he had apparently made every preparation for death; now that his\ncoffin was proved a good fit, Queequeg suddenly rallied; soon there seemed no\nneed of the carpenter’s box: and thereupon, when some expressed their delighted\nsurprise, he, in substance, said, that the cause of his sudden convalescence was\nthis;—at a critical moment, he had just recalled a little duty ashore, which he\nwas leaving undone; and therefore had changed his mind about dying: he could not\ndie yet, he averred. They asked him, then, whether to live or die was a matter\nof his own sovereign will and pleasure. He answered, certainly. In a word, it\nwas Queequeg’s conceit, that if a man made up his mind to live, mere sickness\ncould not kill him: nothing but a whale, or a gale, or some violent,\nungovernable, unintelligent destroyer of that sort.\n\nNow, there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized; that\nwhile a sick, civilized man may be six months convalescing, generally speaking,\na sick savage is almost half-well again in a day. So, in good time my Queequeg\ngained strength; and at length after sitting on the windlass for a few indolent\ndays (but eating with a vigorous appetite) he suddenly leaped to his feet, threw\nout his arms and legs, gave himself a good stretching, yawned a little bit, and\nthen springing into the head of his hoisted boat, and poising a harpoon,\npronounced himself fit for a fight.\n\nWith a wild whimsiness, he now used his coffin for a sea-chest; and emptying\ninto it his canvas bag of clothes, set them in order there. Many spare hours he\nspent, in carving the lid with all manner of grotesque figures and drawings; and\nit seemed that hereby he was striving, in his rude way, to copy parts of the\ntwisted tattooing on his body. And this tattooing had been the work of a\ndeparted prophet and seer of his island, who, by those hieroglyphic marks, had\nwritten out on his body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth, and a\nmystical treatise on the art of attaining truth; so that Queequeg in his own\nproper person was a riddle to unfold; a wondrous work in one volume; but whose\nmysteries not even himself could read, though his own live heart beat against\nthem; and these mysteries were therefore destined in the end to moulder away\nwith the living parchment whereon they were inscribed, and so be unsolved to the\nlast. And this thought it must have been which suggested to Ahab that wild\nexclamation of his, when one morning turning away from surveying poor\nQueequeg—“Oh, devilish tantalization of the gods!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 111. THE PACIFIC.\n\nWhen gliding by the Bashee isles we emerged at last upon the great South Sea;\nwere it not for other things, I could have greeted my dear Pacific with\nuncounted thanks, for now the long supplication of my youth was answered; that\nserene ocean rolled eastwards from me a thousand leagues of blue.\n\nThere is, one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea, whose gently awful\nstirrings seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath; like those fabled\nundulations of the Ephesian sod over the buried Evangelist St. John. And meet it\nis, that over these sea-pastures, wide-rolling watery prairies and Potters’\nFields of all four continents, the waves should rise and fall, and ebb and flow\nunceasingly; for here, millions of mixed shades and shadows, drowned dreams,\nsomnambulisms, reveries; all that we call lives and souls, lie dreaming,\ndreaming, still; tossing like slumberers in their beds; the ever-rolling waves\nbut made so by their restlessness.\n\nTo any meditative Magian rover, this serene Pacific, once beheld, must ever\nafter be the sea of his adoption. It rolls the midmost waters of the world, the\nIndian ocean and Atlantic being but its arms. The same waves wash the moles of\nthe new-built Californian towns, but yesterday planted by the recentest race of\nmen, and lave the faded but still gorgeous skirts of Asiatic lands, older than\nAbraham; while all between float milky-ways of coral isles, and low-lying,\nendless, unknown Archipelagoes, and impenetrable Japans. Thus this mysterious,\ndivine Pacific zones the world’s whole bulk about; makes all coasts one bay to\nit; seems the tide-beating heart of earth. Lifted by those eternal swells, you\nneeds must own the seductive god, bowing your head to Pan.\n\nBut few thoughts of Pan stirred Ahab’s brain, as standing like an iron statue at\nhis accustomed place beside the mizen rigging, with one nostril he unthinkingly\nsnuffed the sugary musk from the Bashee isles (in whose sweet woods mild lovers\nmust be walking), and with the other consciously inhaled the salt breath of the\nnew found sea; that sea in which the hated White Whale must even then be\nswimming. Launched at length upon these almost final waters, and gliding towards\nthe Japanese cruising-ground, the old man’s purpose intensified itself. His firm\nlips met like the lips of a vice; the Delta of his forehead’s veins swelled like\noverladen brooks; in his very sleep, his ringing cry ran through the vaulted\nhull, “Stern all! the White Whale spouts thick blood!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 112. THE BLACKSMITH.\n\nAvailing himself of the mild, summer-cool weather that now reigned in these\nlatitudes, and in preparation for the peculiarly active pursuits shortly to be\nanticipated, Perth, the begrimed, blistered old blacksmith, had not removed his\nportable forge to the hold again, after concluding his contributory work for\nAhab’s leg, but still retained it on deck, fast lashed to ringbolts by the\nforemast; being now almost incessantly invoked by the headsmen, and harpooneers,\nand bowsmen to do some little job for them; altering, or repairing, or new\nshaping their various weapons and boat furniture. Often he would be surrounded\nby an eager circle, all waiting to be served; holding boat-spades, pike-heads,\nharpoons, and lances, and jealously watching his every sooty movement, as he\ntoiled. Nevertheless, this old man’s was a patient hammer wielded by a patient\narm. No murmur, no impatience, no petulance did come from him. Silent, slow, and\nsolemn; bowing over still further his chronically broken back, he toiled away,\nas if toil were life itself, and the heavy beating of his hammer the heavy\nbeating of his heart. And so it was.—Most miserable!\n\nA peculiar walk in this old man, a certain slight but painful appearing yawing\nin his gait, had at an early period of the voyage excited the curiosity of the\nmariners. And to the importunity of their persisted questionings he had finally\ngiven in; and so it came to pass that every one now knew the shameful story of\nhis wretched fate.\n\nBelated, and not innocently, one bitter winter’s midnight, on the road running\nbetween two country towns, the blacksmith half-stupidly felt the deadly numbness\nstealing over him, and sought refuge in a leaning, dilapidated barn. The issue\nwas, the loss of the extremities of both feet. Out of this revelation, part by\npart, at last came out the four acts of the gladness, and the one long, and as\nyet uncatastrophied fifth act of the grief of his life’s drama.\n\nHe was an old man, who, at the age of nearly sixty, had postponedly encountered\nthat thing in sorrow’s technicals called ruin. He had been an artisan of famed\nexcellence, and with plenty to do; owned a house and garden; embraced a\nyouthful, daughter-like, loving wife, and three blithe, ruddy children; every\nSunday went to a cheerful-looking church, planted in a grove. But one night,\nunder cover of darkness, and further concealed in a most cunning disguisement, a\ndesperate burglar slid into his happy home, and robbed them all of everything.\nAnd darker yet to tell, the blacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this\nburglar into his family’s heart. It was the Bottle Conjuror! Upon the opening of\nthat fatal cork, forth flew the fiend, and shrivelled up his home. Now, for\nprudent, most wise, and economic reasons, the blacksmith’s shop was in the\nbasement of his dwelling, but with a separate entrance to it; so that always had\nthe young and loving healthy wife listened with no unhappy nervousness, but with\nvigorous pleasure, to the stout ringing of her young-armed old husband’s hammer;\nwhose reverberations, muffled by passing through the floors and walls, came up\nto her, not unsweetly, in her nursery; and so, to stout Labor’s iron lullaby,\nthe blacksmith’s infants were rocked to slumber.\n\nOh, woe on woe! Oh, Death, why canst thou not sometimes be timely? Hadst thou\ntaken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin came upon him, then had\nthe young widow had a delicious grief, and her orphans a truly venerable,\nlegendary sire to dream of in their after years; and all of them a care-killing\ncompetency. But Death plucked down some virtuous elder brother, on whose\nwhistling daily toil solely hung the responsibilities of some other family, and\nleft the worse than useless old man standing, till the hideous rot of life\nshould make him easier to harvest.\n\nWhy tell the whole? The blows of the basement hammer every day grew more and\nmore between; and each blow every day grew fainter than the last; the wife sat\nfrozen at the window, with tearless eyes, glitteringly gazing into the weeping\nfaces of her children; the bellows fell; the forge choked up with cinders; the\nhouse was sold; the mother dived down into the long church-yard grass; her\nchildren twice followed her thither; and the houseless, familyless old man\nstaggered off a vagabond in crape; his every woe unreverenced; his grey head a\nscorn to flaxen curls!\n\nDeath seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this; but Death is only\na launching into the region of the strange Untried; it is but the first\nsalutation to the possibilities of the immense Remote, the Wild, the Watery, the\nUnshored; therefore, to the death-longing eyes of such men, who still have left\nin them some interior compunctions against suicide, does the all-contributed and\nall-receptive ocean alluringly spread forth his whole plain of unimaginable,\ntaking terrors, and wonderful, new-life adventures; and from the hearts of\ninfinite Pacifics, the thousand mermaids sing to them—“Come hither,\nbroken-hearted; here is another life without the guilt of intermediate death;\nhere are wonders supernatural, without dying for them. Come hither! bury thyself\nin a life which, to your now equally abhorred and abhorring, landed world, is\nmore oblivious than death. Come hither! put up thy gravestone, too, within the\nchurchyard, and come hither, till we marry thee!”\n\nHearkening to these voices, East and West, by early sunrise, and by fall of eve,\nthe blacksmith’s soul responded, Aye, I come! And so Perth went a-whaling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 113. THE FORGE.\n\nWith matted beard, and swathed in a bristling shark-skin apron, about mid-day,\nPerth was standing between his forge and anvil, the latter placed upon an\niron-wood log, with one hand holding a pike-head in the coals, and with the\nother at his forge’s lungs, when Captain Ahab came along, carrying in his hand a\nsmall rusty-looking leathern bag. While yet a little distance from the forge,\nmoody Ahab paused; till at last, Perth, withdrawing his iron from the fire,\nbegan hammering it upon the anvil—the red mass sending off the sparks in thick\nhovering flights, some of which flew close to Ahab.\n\n“Are these thy Mother Carey’s chickens, Perth? they are always flying in thy\nwake; birds of good omen, too, but not to all;—look here, they burn; but\nthou—thou liv’st among them without a scorch.”\n\n“Because I am scorched all over, Captain Ahab,” answered Perth, resting for a\nmoment on his hammer; “I am past scorching; not easily can’st thou scorch a\nscar.”\n\n“Well, well; no more. Thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly, sanely woeful to me.\nIn no Paradise myself, I am impatient of all misery in others that is not mad.\nThou should’st go mad, blacksmith; say, why dost thou not go mad? How can’st\nthou endure without being mad? Do the heavens yet hate thee, that thou can’st\nnot go mad?—What wert thou making there?”\n\n“Welding an old pike-head, sir; there were seams and dents in it.”\n\n“And can’st thou make it all smooth again, blacksmith, after such hard usage as\nit had?”\n\n“I think so, sir.”\n\n“And I suppose thou can’st smoothe almost any seams and dents; never mind how\nhard the metal, blacksmith?”\n\n“Aye, sir, I think I can; all seams and dents but one.”\n\n“Look ye here, then,” cried Ahab, passionately advancing, and leaning with both\nhands on Perth’s shoulders; “look ye here—here—can ye smoothe out a seam like\nthis, blacksmith,” sweeping one hand across his ribbed brow; “if thou could’st,\nblacksmith, glad enough would I lay my head upon thy anvil, and feel thy\nheaviest hammer between my eyes. Answer! Can’st thou smoothe this seam?”\n\n“Oh! that is the one, sir! Said I not all seams and dents but one?”\n\n“Aye, blacksmith, it is the one; aye, man, it is unsmoothable; for though thou\nonly see’st it here in my flesh, it has worked down into the bone of my\nskull—that is all wrinkles! But, away with child’s play; no more gaffs and pikes\nto-day. Look ye here!” jingling the leathern bag, as if it were full of gold\ncoins. “I, too, want a harpoon made; one that a thousand yoke of fiends could\nnot part, Perth; something that will stick in a whale like his own fin-bone.\nThere’s the stuff,” flinging the pouch upon the anvil. “Look ye, blacksmith,\nthese are the gathered nail-stubbs of the steel shoes of racing horses.”\n\n“Horse-shoe stubbs, sir? Why, Captain Ahab, thou hast here, then, the best and\nstubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever work.”\n\n“I know it, old man; these stubbs will weld together like glue from the melted\nbones of murderers. Quick! forge me the harpoon. And forge me first, twelve rods\nfor its shank; then wind, and twist, and hammer these twelve together like the\nyarns and strands of a tow-line. Quick! I’ll blow the fire.”\n\nWhen at last the twelve rods were made, Ahab tried them, one by one, by\nspiralling them, with his own hand, round a long, heavy iron bolt. “A flaw!”\nrejecting the last one. “Work that over again, Perth.”\n\nThis done, Perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one, when Ahab\nstayed his hand, and said he would weld his own iron. As, then, with regular,\ngasping hems, he hammered on the anvil, Perth passing to him the glowing rods,\none after the other, and the hard pressed forge shooting up its intense straight\nflame, the Parsee passed silently, and bowing over his head towards the fire,\nseemed invoking some curse or some blessing on the toil. But, as Ahab looked up,\nhe slid aside.\n\n“What’s that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for?” muttered Stubb, looking\non from the forecastle. “That Parsee smells fire like a fusee; and smells of it\nhimself, like a hot musket’s powder-pan.”\n\nAt last the shank, in one complete rod, received its final heat; and as Perth,\nto temper it, plunged it all hissing into the cask of water near by, the\nscalding steam shot up into Ahab’s bent face.\n\n“Would’st thou brand me, Perth?” wincing for a moment with the pain; “have I\nbeen but forging my own branding-iron, then?”\n\n“Pray God, not that; yet I fear something, Captain Ahab. Is not this harpoon for\nthe White Whale?”\n\n“For the white fiend! But now for the barbs; thou must make them thyself, man.\nHere are my razors—the best of steel; here, and make the barbs sharp as the\nneedle-sleet of the Icy Sea.”\n\nFor a moment, the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would fain not use\nthem.\n\n“Take them, man, I have no need for them; for I now neither shave, sup, nor pray\ntill—but here—to work!”\n\nFashioned at last into an arrowy shape, and welded by Perth to the shank, the\nsteel soon pointed the end of the iron; and as the blacksmith was about giving\nthe barbs their final heat, prior to tempering them, he cried to Ahab to place\nthe water-cask near.\n\n“No, no—no water for that; I want it of the true death-temper. Ahoy, there!\nTashtego, Queequeg, Daggoo! What say ye, pagans! Will ye give me as much blood\nas will cover this barb?” holding it high up. A cluster of dark nods replied,\nYes. Three punctures were made in the heathen flesh, and the White Whale’s barbs\nwere then tempered.\n\n“Ego non baptizo te in nomine patris, sed in nomine diaboli!” deliriously howled\nAhab, as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured the baptismal blood.\n\nNow, mustering the spare poles from below, and selecting one of hickory, with\nthe bark still investing it, Ahab fitted the end to the socket of the iron. A\ncoil of new tow-line was then unwound, and some fathoms of it taken to the\nwindlass, and stretched to a great tension. Pressing his foot upon it, till the\nrope hummed like a harp-string, then eagerly bending over it, and seeing no\nstrandings, Ahab exclaimed, “Good! and now for the seizings.”\n\nAt one extremity the rope was unstranded, and the separate spread yarns were all\nbraided and woven round the socket of the harpoon; the pole was then driven hard\nup into the socket; from the lower end the rope was traced half-way along the\npole’s length, and firmly secured so, with intertwistings of twine. This done,\npole, iron, and rope—like the Three Fates—remained inseparable, and Ahab moodily\nstalked away with the weapon; the sound of his ivory leg, and the sound of the\nhickory pole, both hollowly ringing along every plank. But ere he entered his\ncabin, light, unnatural, half-bantering, yet most piteous sound was heard. Oh,\nPip! thy wretched laugh, thy idle but unresting eye; all thy strange mummeries\nnot unmeaningly blended with the black tragedy of the melancholy ship, and\nmocked it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 114. THE GILDER.\n\nPenetrating further and further into the heart of the Japanese cruising ground,\nthe Pequod was soon all astir in the fishery. Often, in mild, pleasant weather,\nfor twelve, fifteen, eighteen, and twenty hours on the stretch, they were\nengaged in the boats, steadily pulling, or sailing, or paddling after the\nwhales, or for an interlude of sixty or seventy minutes calmly awaiting their\nuprising; though with but small success for their pains.\n\nAt such times, under an abated sun; afloat all day upon smooth, slow heaving\nswells; seated in his boat, light as a birch canoe; and so sociably mixing with\nthe soft waves themselves, that like hearth-stone cats they purr against the\ngunwale; these are the times of dreamy quietude, when beholding the tranquil\nbeauty and brilliancy of the ocean’s skin, one forgets the tiger heart that\npants beneath it; and would not willingly remember, that this velvet paw but\nconceals a remorseless fang.\n\nThese are the times, when in his whale-boat the rover softly feels a certain\nfilial, confident, land-like feeling towards the sea; that he regards it as so\nmuch flowery earth; and the distant ship revealing only the tops of her masts,\nseems struggling forward, not through high rolling waves, but through the tall\ngrass of a rolling prairie: as when the western emigrants’ horses only show\ntheir erected ears, while their hidden bodies widely wade through the amazing\nverdure.\n\nThe long-drawn virgin vales; the mild blue hill-sides; as over these there\nsteals the hush, the hum; you almost swear that play-wearied children lie\nsleeping in these solitudes, in some glad May-time, when the flowers of the\nwoods are plucked. And all this mixes with your most mystic mood; so that fact\nand fancy, half-way meeting, interpenetrate, and form one seamless whole.\n\nNor did such soothing scenes, however temporary, fail of at least as temporary\nan effect on Ahab. But if these secret golden keys did seem to open in him his\nown secret golden treasuries, yet did his breath upon them prove but tarnishing.\n\nOh, grassy glades! oh, ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul; in ye,—though\nlong parched by the dead drought of the earthy life,—in ye, men yet may roll,\nlike young horses in new morning clover; and for some few fleeting moments, feel\nthe cool dew of the life immortal on them. Would to God these blessed calms\nwould last. But the mingled, mingling threads of life are woven by warp and\nwoof: calms crossed by storms, a storm for every calm. There is no steady\nunretracing progress in this life; we do not advance through fixed gradations,\nand at the last one pause:—through infancy’s unconscious spell, boyhood’s\nthoughtless faith, adolescence’ doubt (the common doom), then scepticism, then\ndisbelief, resting at last in manhood’s pondering repose of If. But once gone\nthrough, we trace the round again; and are infants, boys, and men, and Ifs\neternally. Where lies the final harbor, whence we unmoor no more? In what rapt\nether sails the world, of which the weariest will never weary? Where is the\nfoundling’s father hidden? Our souls are like those orphans whose unwedded\nmothers die in bearing them: the secret of our paternity lies in their grave,\nand we must there to learn it.\n\nAnd that same day, too, gazing far down from his boat’s side into that same\ngolden sea, Starbuck lowly murmured:—\n\n“Loveliness unfathomable, as ever lover saw in his young bride’s eye!—Tell me\nnot of thy teeth-tiered sharks, and thy kidnapping cannibal ways. Let faith oust\nfact; let fancy oust memory; I look deep down and do believe.”\n\nAnd Stubb, fish-like, with sparkling scales, leaped up in that same golden\nlight:—\n\n“I am Stubb, and Stubb has his history; but here Stubb takes oaths that he has\nalways been jolly!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 115. THE PEQUOD MEETS THE BACHELOR.\n\nAnd jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing down before\nthe wind, some few weeks after Ahab’s harpoon had been welded.\n\nIt was a Nantucket ship, the Bachelor, which had just wedged in her last cask of\noil, and bolted down her bursting hatches; and now, in glad holiday apparel, was\njoyously, though somewhat vain-gloriously, sailing round among the\nwidely-separated ships on the ground, previous to pointing her prow for home.\n\nThe three men at her mast-head wore long streamers of narrow red bunting at\ntheir hats; from the stern, a whale-boat was suspended, bottom down; and hanging\ncaptive from the bowsprit was seen the long lower jaw of the last whale they had\nslain. Signals, ensigns, and jacks of all colours were flying from her rigging,\non every side. Sideways lashed in each of her three basketed tops were two\nbarrels of sperm; above which, in her top-mast cross-trees, you saw slender\nbreakers of the same precious fluid; and nailed to her main truck was a brazen\nlamp.\n\nAs was afterwards learned, the Bachelor had met with the most surprising\nsuccess; all the more wonderful, for that while cruising in the same seas\nnumerous other vessels had gone entire months without securing a single fish.\nNot only had barrels of beef and bread been given away to make room for the far\nmore valuable sperm, but additional supplemental casks had been bartered for,\nfrom the ships she had met; and these were stowed along the deck, and in the\ncaptain’s and officers’ state-rooms. Even the cabin table itself had been\nknocked into kindling-wood; and the cabin mess dined off the broad head of an\noil-butt, lashed down to the floor for a centrepiece. In the forecastle, the\nsailors had actually caulked and pitched their chests, and filled them; it was\nhumorously added, that the cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler, and\nfilled it; that the steward had plugged his spare coffee-pot and filled it; that\nthe harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons and filled them; that\nindeed everything was filled with sperm, except the captain’s pantaloons\npockets, and those he reserved to thrust his hands into, in self-complacent\ntestimony of his entire satisfaction.\n\nAs this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody Pequod, the barbarian\nsound of enormous drums came from her forecastle; and drawing still nearer, a\ncrowd of her men were seen standing round her huge try-pots, which, covered with\nthe parchment-like poke or stomach skin of the black fish, gave forth a loud\nroar to every stroke of the clenched hands of the crew. On the quarter-deck, the\nmates and harpooneers were dancing with the olive-hued girls who had eloped with\nthem from the Polynesian Isles; while suspended in an ornamented boat, firmly\nsecured aloft between the foremast and mainmast, three Long Island negroes, with\nglittering fiddle-bows of whale ivory, were presiding over the hilarious jig.\nMeanwhile, others of the ship’s company were tumultuously busy at the masonry of\nthe try-works, from which the huge pots had been removed. You would have almost\nthought they were pulling down the cursed Bastille, such wild cries they raised,\nas the now useless brick and mortar were being hurled into the sea.\n\nLord and master over all this scene, the captain stood erect on the ship’s\nelevated quarter-deck, so that the whole rejoicing drama was full before him,\nand seemed merely contrived for his own individual diversion.\n\nAnd Ahab, he too was standing on his quarter-deck, shaggy and black, with a\nstubborn gloom; and as the two ships crossed each other’s wakes—one all\njubilations for things passed, the other all forebodings as to things to\ncome—their two captains in themselves impersonated the whole striking contrast\nof the scene.\n\n“Come aboard, come aboard!” cried the gay Bachelor’s commander, lifting a glass\nand a bottle in the air.\n\n“Hast seen the White Whale?” gritted Ahab in reply.\n\n“No; only heard of him; but don’t believe in him at all,” said the other\ngood-humoredly. “Come aboard!”\n\n“Thou art too damned jolly. Sail on. Hast lost any men?”\n\n“Not enough to speak of—two islanders, that’s all;—but come aboard, old hearty,\ncome along. I’ll soon take that black from your brow. Come along, will ye\n(merry’s the play); a full ship and homeward-bound.”\n\n“How wondrous familiar is a fool!” muttered Ahab; then aloud, “Thou art a full\nship and homeward bound, thou sayst; well, then, call me an empty ship, and\noutward-bound. So go thy ways, and I will mine. Forward there! Set all sail, and\nkeep her to the wind!”\n\nAnd thus, while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze, the other\nstubbornly fought against it; and so the two vessels parted; the crew of the\nPequod looking with grave, lingering glances towards the receding Bachelor; but\nthe Bachelor’s men never heeding their gaze for the lively revelry they were in.\nAnd as Ahab, leaning over the taffrail, eyed the homeward-bound craft, he took\nfrom his pocket a small vial of sand, and then looking from the ship to the\nvial, seemed thereby bringing two remote associations together, for that vial\nwas filled with Nantucket soundings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 116. THE DYING WHALE.\n\nNot seldom in this life, when, on the right side, fortune’s favourites sail\nclose by us, we, though all adroop before, catch somewhat of the rushing breeze,\nand joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out. So seemed it with the Pequod. For\nnext day after encountering the gay Bachelor, whales were seen and four were\nslain; and one of them by Ahab.\n\nIt was far down the afternoon; and when all the spearings of the crimson fight\nwere done: and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky, sun and whale both\nstilly died together; then, such a sweetness and such plaintiveness, such\ninwreathing orisons curled up in that rosy air, that it almost seemed as if far\nover from the deep green convent valleys of the Manilla isles, the Spanish\nland-breeze, wantonly turned sailor, had gone to sea, freighted with these\nvesper hymns.\n\nSoothed again, but only soothed to deeper gloom, Ahab, who had sterned off from\nthe whale, sat intently watching his final wanings from the now tranquil boat.\nFor that strange spectacle observable in all sperm whales dying—the turning\nsunwards of the head, and so expiring—that strange spectacle, beheld of such a\nplacid evening, somehow to Ahab conveyed a wondrousness unknown before.\n\n“He turns and turns him to it,—how slowly, but how steadfastly, his\nhomage-rendering and invoking brow, with his last dying motions. He too worships\nfire; most faithful, broad, baronial vassal of the sun!—Oh that these\ntoo-favouring eyes should see these too-favouring sights. Look! here, far\nwater-locked; beyond all hum of human weal or woe; in these most candid and\nimpartial seas; where to traditions no rocks furnish tablets; where for long\nChinese ages, the billows have still rolled on speechless and unspoken to, as\nstars that shine upon the Niger’s unknown source; here, too, life dies sunwards\nfull of faith; but see! no sooner dead, than death whirls round the corpse, and\nit heads some other way.\n\n“Oh, thou dark Hindoo half of nature, who of drowned bones hast builded thy\nseparate throne somewhere in the heart of these unverdured seas; thou art an\ninfidel, thou queen, and too truly speakest to me in the wide-slaughtering\nTyphoon, and the hushed burial of its after calm. Nor has this thy whale\nsunwards turned his dying head, and then gone round again, without a lesson to\nme.\n\n“Oh, trebly hooped and welded hip of power! Oh, high aspiring, rainbowed\njet!—that one strivest, this one jettest all in vain! In vain, oh whale, dost\nthou seek intercedings with yon all-quickening sun, that only calls forth life,\nbut gives it not again. Yet dost thou, darker half, rock me with a prouder, if a\ndarker faith. All thy unnamable imminglings float beneath me here; I am buoyed\nby breaths of once living things, exhaled as air, but water now.\n\n“Then hail, for ever hail, O sea, in whose eternal tossings the wild fowl finds\nhis only rest. Born of earth, yet suckled by the sea; though hill and valley\nmothered me, ye billows are my foster-brothers!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 117. THE WHALE WATCH.\n\nThe four whales slain that evening had died wide apart; one, far to windward;\none, less distant, to leeward; one ahead; one astern. These last three were\nbrought alongside ere nightfall; but the windward one could not be reached till\nmorning; and the boat that had killed it lay by its side all night; and that\nboat was Ahab’s.\n\nThe waif-pole was thrust upright into the dead whale’s spout-hole; and the\nlantern hanging from its top, cast a troubled flickering glare upon the black,\nglossy back, and far out upon the midnight waves, which gently chafed the\nwhale’s broad flank, like soft surf upon a beach.\n\nAhab and all his boat’s crew seemed asleep but the Parsee; who crouching in the\nbow, sat watching the sharks, that spectrally played round the whale, and tapped\nthe light cedar planks with their tails. A sound like the moaning in squadrons\nover Asphaltites of unforgiven ghosts of Gomorrah, ran shuddering through the\nair.\n\nStarted from his slumbers, Ahab, face to face, saw the Parsee; and hooped round\nby the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a flooded world. “I have\ndreamed it again,” said he.\n\n“Of the hearses? Have I not said, old man, that neither hearse nor coffin can be\nthine?”\n\n“And who are hearsed that die on the sea?”\n\n“But I said, old man, that ere thou couldst die on this voyage, two hearses must\nverily be seen by thee on the sea; the first not made by mortal hands; and the\nvisible wood of the last one must be grown in America.”\n\n“Aye, aye! a strange sight that, Parsee:—a hearse and its plumes floating over\nthe ocean with the waves for the pall-bearers. Ha! Such a sight we shall not\nsoon see.”\n\n“Believe it or not, thou canst not die till it be seen, old man.”\n\n“And what was that saying about thyself?”\n\n“Though it come to the last, I shall still go before thee thy pilot.”\n\n“And when thou art so gone before—if that ever befall—then ere I can follow,\nthou must still appear to me, to pilot me still?—Was it not so? Well, then, did\nI believe all ye say, oh my pilot! I have here two pledges that I shall yet slay\nMoby Dick and survive it.”\n\n“Take another pledge, old man,” said the Parsee, as his eyes lighted up like\nfire-flies in the gloom—“Hemp only can kill thee.”\n\n“The gallows, ye mean.—I am immortal then, on land and on sea,” cried Ahab, with\na laugh of derision;—“Immortal on land and on sea!”\n\nBoth were silent again, as one man. The grey dawn came on, and the slumbering\ncrew arose from the boat’s bottom, and ere noon the dead whale was brought to\nthe ship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 118. THE QUADRANT.\n\nThe season for the Line at length drew near; and every day when Ahab, coming\nfrom his cabin, cast his eyes aloft, the vigilant helmsman would ostentatiously\nhandle his spokes, and the eager mariners quickly run to the braces, and would\nstand there with all their eyes centrally fixed on the nailed doubloon;\nimpatient for the order to point the ship’s prow for the equator. In good time\nthe order came. It was hard upon high noon; and Ahab, seated in the bows of his\nhigh-hoisted boat, was about taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to\ndetermine his latitude.\n\nNow, in that Japanese sea, the days in summer are as freshets of effulgences.\nThat unblinkingly vivid Japanese sun seems the blazing focus of the glassy\nocean’s immeasurable burning-glass. The sky looks lacquered; clouds there are\nnone; the horizon floats; and this nakedness of unrelieved radiance is as the\ninsufferable splendors of God’s throne. Well that Ahab’s quadrant was furnished\nwith coloured glasses, through which to take sight of that solar fire. So,\nswinging his seated form to the roll of the ship, and with his\nastrological-looking instrument placed to his eye, he remained in that posture\nfor some moments to catch the precise instant when the sun should gain its\nprecise meridian. Meantime while his whole attention was absorbed, the Parsee\nwas kneeling beneath him on the ship’s deck, and with face thrown up like\nAhab’s, was eyeing the same sun with him; only the lids of his eyes half hooded\ntheir orbs, and his wild face was subdued to an earthly passionlessness. At\nlength the desired observation was taken; and with his pencil upon his ivory\nleg, Ahab soon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise instant.\nThen falling into a moment’s revery, he again looked up towards the sun and\nmurmured to himself: “Thou sea-mark! thou high and mighty Pilot! thou tellest me\ntruly where I am—but canst thou cast the least hint where I shall be? Or canst\nthou tell where some other thing besides me is this moment living? Where is Moby\nDick? This instant thou must be eyeing him. These eyes of mine look into the\nvery eye that is even now beholding him; aye, and into the eye that is even now\nequally beholding the objects on the unknown, thither side of thee, thou sun!”\n\nThen gazing at his quadrant, and handling, one after the other, its numerous\ncabalistical contrivances, he pondered again, and muttered: “Foolish toy!\nbabies’ plaything of haughty Admirals, and Commodores, and Captains; the world\nbrags of thee, of thy cunning and might; but what after all canst thou do, but\ntell the poor, pitiful point, where thou thyself happenest to be on this wide\nplanet, and the hand that holds thee: no! not one jot more! Thou canst not tell\nwhere one drop of water or one grain of sand will be to-morrow noon; and yet\nwith thy impotence thou insultest the sun! Science! Curse thee, thou vain toy;\nand cursed be all the things that cast man’s eyes aloft to that heaven, whose\nlive vividness but scorches him, as these old eyes are even now scorched with\nthy light, O sun! Level by nature to this earth’s horizon are the glances of\nman’s eyes; not shot from the crown of his head, as if God had meant him to gaze\non his firmament. Curse thee, thou quadrant!” dashing it to the deck, “no longer\nwill I guide my earthly way by thee; the level ship’s compass, and the level\ndead-reckoning, by log and by line; these shall conduct me, and show me my place\non the sea. Aye,” lighting from the boat to the deck, “thus I trample on thee,\nthou paltry thing that feebly pointest on high; thus I split and destroy thee!”\n\nAs the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live and dead feet,\na sneering triumph that seemed meant for Ahab, and a fatalistic despair that\nseemed meant for himself—these passed over the mute, motionless Parsee’s face.\nUnobserved he rose and glided away; while, awestruck by the aspect of their\ncommander, the seamen clustered together on the forecastle, till Ahab,\ntroubledly pacing the deck, shouted out—“To the braces! Up helm!—square in!”\n\nIn an instant the yards swung round; and as the ship half-wheeled upon her heel,\nher three firm-seated graceful masts erectly poised upon her long, ribbed hull,\nseemed as the three Horatii pirouetting on one sufficient steed.\n\nStanding between the knight-heads, Starbuck watched the Pequod’s tumultuous way,\nand Ahab’s also, as he went lurching along the deck.\n\n“I have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow, full of its\ntormented flaming life; and I have seen it wane at last, down, down, to dumbest\ndust. Old man of oceans! of all this fiery life of thine, what will at length\nremain but one little heap of ashes!”\n\n“Aye,” cried Stubb, “but sea-coal ashes—mind ye that, Mr. Starbuck—sea-coal, not\nyour common charcoal. Well, well; I heard Ahab mutter, ‘Here some one thrusts\nthese cards into these old hands of mine; swears that I must play them, and no\nothers.’ And damn me, Ahab, but thou actest right; live in the game, and die in\nit!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 119. THE CANDLES.\n\nWarmest climes but nurse the cruellest fangs: the tiger of Bengal crouches in\nspiced groves of ceaseless verdure. Skies the most effulgent but basket the\ndeadliest thunders: gorgeous Cuba knows tornadoes that never swept tame northern\nlands. So, too, it is, that in these resplendent Japanese seas the mariner\nencounters the direst of all storms, the Typhoon. It will sometimes burst from\nout that cloudless sky, like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town.\n\nTowards evening of that day, the Pequod was torn of her canvas, and bare-poled\nwas left to fight a Typhoon which had struck her directly ahead. When darkness\ncame on, sky and sea roared and split with the thunder, and blazed with the\nlightning, that showed the disabled masts fluttering here and there with the\nrags which the first fury of the tempest had left for its after sport.\n\nHolding by a shroud, Starbuck was standing on the quarter-deck; at every flash\nof the lightning glancing aloft, to see what additional disaster might have\nbefallen the intricate hamper there; while Stubb and Flask were directing the\nmen in the higher hoisting and firmer lashing of the boats. But all their pains\nseemed naught. Though lifted to the very top of the cranes, the windward quarter\nboat (Ahab’s) did not escape. A great rolling sea, dashing high up against the\nreeling ship’s high teetering side, stove in the boat’s bottom at the stern, and\nleft it again, all dripping through like a sieve.\n\n“Bad work, bad work! Mr. Starbuck,” said Stubb, regarding the wreck, “but the\nsea will have its way. Stubb, for one, can’t fight it. You see, Mr. Starbuck, a\nwave has such a great long start before it leaps, all round the world it runs,\nand then comes the spring! But as for me, all the start I have to meet it, is\njust across the deck here. But never mind; it’s all in fun: so the old song\nsays;”—(sings.)\n\n  Oh! jolly is the gale,\n  And a joker is the whale,\n  A’ flourishin’ his tail,—\n  Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!\n\n  The scud all a flyin’,\n  That’s his flip only foamin’;\n  When he stirs in the spicin’,—\n  Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!\n\n  Thunder splits the ships,\n  But he only smacks his lips,\n  A tastin’ of this flip,—\n  Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!\n\n\n“Avast Stubb,” cried Starbuck, “let the Typhoon sing, and strike his harp here\nin our rigging; but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold thy peace.”\n\n“But I am not a brave man; never said I was a brave man; I am a coward; and I\nsing to keep up my spirits. And I tell you what it is, Mr. Starbuck, there’s no\nway to stop my singing in this world but to cut my throat. And when that’s done,\nten to one I sing ye the doxology for a wind-up.”\n\n“Madman! look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own.”\n\n“What! how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else, never mind how\nfoolish?”\n\n“Here!” cried Starbuck, seizing Stubb by the shoulder, and pointing his hand\ntowards the weather bow, “markest thou not that the gale comes from the\neastward, the very course Ahab is to run for Moby Dick? the very course he swung\nto this day noon? now mark his boat there; where is that stove? In the\nstern-sheets, man; where he is wont to stand—his stand-point is stove, man! Now\njump overboard, and sing away, if thou must!\n\n“I don’t half understand ye: what’s in the wind?”\n\n“Yes, yes, round the Cape of Good Hope is the shortest way to Nantucket,”\nsoliloquized Starbuck suddenly, heedless of Stubb’s question. “The gale that now\nhammers at us to stave us, we can turn it into a fair wind that will drive us\ntowards home. Yonder, to windward, all is blackness of doom; but to leeward,\nhomeward—I see it lightens up there; but not with the lightning.”\n\nAt that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness, following the\nflashes, a voice was heard at his side; and almost at the same instant a volley\nof thunder peals rolled overhead.\n\n“Who’s there?”\n\n“Old Thunder!” said Ahab, groping his way along the bulwarks to his pivot-hole;\nbut suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowed lances of fire.\n\nNow, as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off the\nperilous fluid into the soil; so the kindred rod which at sea some ships carry\nto each mast, is intended to conduct it into the water. But as this conductor\nmust descend to considerable depth, that its end may avoid all contact with the\nhull; and as moreover, if kept constantly towing there, it would be liable to\nmany mishaps, besides interfering not a little with some of the rigging, and\nmore or less impeding the vessel’s way in the water; because of all this, the\nlower parts of a ship’s lightning-rods are not always overboard; but are\ngenerally made in long slender links, so as to be the more readily hauled up\ninto the chains outside, or thrown down into the sea, as occasion may require.\n\n“The rods! the rods!” cried Starbuck to the crew, suddenly admonished to\nvigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting flambeaux, to light\nAhab to his post. “Are they overboard? drop them over, fore and aft. Quick!”\n\n“Avast!” cried Ahab; “let’s have fair play here, though we be the weaker side.\nYet I’ll contribute to raise rods on the Himmalehs and Andes, that all the world\nmay be secured; but out on privileges! Let them be, sir.”\n\n“Look aloft!” cried Starbuck. “The corpusants! the corpusants!”\n\nAll the yard-arms were tipped with a pallid fire; and touched at each\ntri-pointed lightning-rod-end with three tapering white flames, each of the\nthree tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air, like three\ngigantic wax tapers before an altar.\n\n“Blast the boat! let it go!” cried Stubb at this instant, as a swashing sea\nheaved up under his own little craft, so that its gunwale violently jammed his\nhand, as he was passing a lashing. “Blast it!”—but slipping backward on the\ndeck, his uplifted eyes caught the flames; and immediately shifting his tone he\ncried—“The corpusants have mercy on us all!”\n\nTo sailors, oaths are household words; they will swear in the trance of the\ncalm, and in the teeth of the tempest; they will imprecate curses from the\ntopsail-yard-arms, when most they teeter over to a seething sea; but in all my\nvoyagings, seldom have I heard a common oath when God’s burning finger has been\nlaid on the ship; when His “Mene, Mene, Tekel Upharsin” has been woven into the\nshrouds and the cordage.\n\nWhile this pallidness was burning aloft, few words were heard from the enchanted\ncrew; who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle, all their eyes gleaming\nin that pale phosphorescence, like a far away constellation of stars. Relieved\nagainst the ghostly light, the gigantic jet negro, Daggoo, loomed up to thrice\nhis real stature, and seemed the black cloud from which the thunder had come.\nThe parted mouth of Tashtego revealed his shark-white teeth, which strangely\ngleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants; while lit up by the\npreternatural light, Queequeg’s tattooing burned like Satanic blue flames on his\nbody.\n\nThe tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft; and once more the\nPequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall. A moment or two\npassed, when Starbuck, going forward, pushed against some one. It was Stubb.\n“What thinkest thou now, man; I heard thy cry; it was not the same in the song.”\n\n“No, no, it wasn’t; I said the corpusants have mercy on us all; and I hope they\nwill, still. But do they only have mercy on long faces?—have they no bowels for\na laugh? And look ye, Mr. Starbuck—but it’s too dark to look. Hear me, then: I\ntake that mast-head flame we saw for a sign of good luck; for those masts are\nrooted in a hold that is going to be chock a’ block with sperm-oil, d’ye see;\nand so, all that sperm will work up into the masts, like sap in a tree. Yes, our\nthree masts will yet be as three spermaceti candles—that’s the good promise we\nsaw.”\n\nAt that moment Starbuck caught sight of Stubb’s face slowly beginning to glimmer\ninto sight. Glancing upwards, he cried: “See! see!” and once more the high\ntapering flames were beheld with what seemed redoubled supernaturalness in their\npallor.\n\n“The corpusants have mercy on us all,” cried Stubb, again.\n\nAt the base of the mainmast, full beneath the doubloon and the flame, the Parsee\nwas kneeling in Ahab’s front, but with his head bowed away from him; while near\nby, from the arched and overhanging rigging, where they had just been engaged\nsecuring a spar, a number of the seamen, arrested by the glare, now cohered\ntogether, and hung pendulous, like a knot of numbed wasps from a drooping,\norchard twig. In various enchanted attitudes, like the standing, or stepping, or\nrunning skeletons in Herculaneum, others remained rooted to the deck; but all\ntheir eyes upcast.\n\n“Aye, aye, men!” cried Ahab. “Look up at it; mark it well; the white flame but\nlights the way to the White Whale! Hand me those mainmast links there; I would\nfain feel this pulse, and let mine beat against it; blood against fire! So.”\n\nThen turning—the last link held fast in his left hand, he put his foot upon the\nParsee; and with fixed upward eye, and high-flung right arm, he stood erect\nbefore the lofty tri-pointed trinity of flames.\n\n“Oh! thou clear spirit of clear fire, whom on these seas I as Persian once did\nworship, till in the sacramental act so burned by thee, that to this hour I bear\nthe scar; I now know thee, thou clear spirit, and I now know that thy right\nworship is defiance. To neither love nor reverence wilt thou be kind; and e’en\nfor hate thou canst but kill; and all are killed. No fearless fool now fronts\nthee. I own thy speechless, placeless power; but to the last gasp of my\nearthquake life will dispute its unconditional, unintegral mastery in me. In the\nmidst of the personified impersonal, a personality stands here. Though but a\npoint at best; whencesoe’er I came; wheresoe’er I go; yet while I earthly live,\nthe queenly personality lives in me, and feels her royal rights. But war is\npain, and hate is woe. Come in thy lowest form of love, and I will kneel and\nkiss thee; but at thy highest, come as mere supernal power; and though thou\nlaunchest navies of full-freighted worlds, there’s that in here that still\nremains indifferent. Oh, thou clear spirit, of thy fire thou madest me, and like\na true child of fire, I breathe it back to thee.”\n\n[Sudden, repeated flashes of lightning; the nine flames leap lengthwise to\nthrice their previous height; Ahab, with the rest, closes his eyes, his right\nhand pressed hard upon them.]\n\n“I own thy speechless, placeless power; said I not so? Nor was it wrung from me;\nnor do I now drop these links. Thou canst blind; but I can then grope. Thou\ncanst consume; but I can then be ashes. Take the homage of these poor eyes, and\nshutter-hands. I would not take it. The lightning flashes through my skull; mine\neye-balls ache and ache; my whole beaten brain seems as beheaded, and rolling on\nsome stunning ground. Oh, oh! Yet blindfold, yet will I talk to thee. Light\nthough thou be, thou leapest out of darkness; but I am darkness leaping out of\nlight, leaping out of thee! The javelins cease; open eyes; see, or not? There\nburn the flames! Oh, thou magnanimous! now I do glory in my genealogy. But thou\nart but my fiery father; my sweet mother, I know not. Oh, cruel! what hast thou\ndone with her? There lies my puzzle; but thine is greater. Thou knowest not how\ncame ye, hence callest thyself unbegotten; certainly knowest not thy beginning,\nhence callest thyself unbegun. I know that of me, which thou knowest not of\nthyself, oh, thou omnipotent. There is some unsuffusing thing beyond thee, thou\nclear spirit, to whom all thy eternity is but time, all thy creativeness\nmechanical. Through thee, thy flaming self, my scorched eyes do dimly see it.\nOh, thou foundling fire, thou hermit immemorial, thou too hast thy\nincommunicable riddle, thy unparticipated grief. Here again with haughty agony,\nI read my sire. Leap! leap up, and lick the sky! I leap with thee; I burn with\nthee; would fain be welded with thee; defyingly I worship thee!”\n\n“The boat! the boat!” cried Starbuck, “look at thy boat, old man!”\n\nAhab’s harpoon, the one forged at Perth’s fire, remained firmly lashed in its\nconspicuous crotch, so that it projected beyond his whale-boat’s bow; but the\nsea that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather sheath to drop off;\nand from the keen steel barb there now came a levelled flame of pale, forked\nfire. As the silent harpoon burned there like a serpent’s tongue, Starbuck\ngrasped Ahab by the arm—“God, God is against thee, old man; forbear! ’tis an ill\nvoyage! ill begun, ill continued; let me square the yards, while we may, old\nman, and make a fair wind of it homewards, to go on a better voyage than this.”\n\nOverhearing Starbuck, the panic-stricken crew instantly ran to the braces—though\nnot a sail was left aloft. For the moment all the aghast mate’s thoughts seemed\ntheirs; they raised a half mutinous cry. But dashing the rattling lightning\nlinks to the deck, and snatching the burning harpoon, Ahab waved it like a torch\namong them; swearing to transfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a\nrope’s end. Petrified by his aspect, and still more shrinking from the fiery\ndart that he held, the men fell back in dismay, and Ahab again spoke:—\n\n“All your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as binding as mine; and heart, soul,\nand body, lungs and life, old Ahab is bound. And that ye may know to what tune\nthis heart beats; look ye here; thus I blow out the last fear!” And with one\nblast of his breath he extinguished the flame.\n\nAs in the hurricane that sweeps the plain, men fly the neighborhood of some\nlone, gigantic elm, whose very height and strength but render it so much the\nmore unsafe, because so much the more a mark for thunderbolts; so at those last\nwords of Ahab’s many of the mariners did run from him in a terror of dismay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 120. THE DECK TOWARDS THE END OF THE FIRST NIGHT WATCH.\n\nAhab standing by the helm. Starbuck approaching him.\n\n“We must send down the main-top-sail yard, sir. The band is working loose and\nthe lee lift is half-stranded. Shall I strike it, sir?”\n\n“Strike nothing; lash it. If I had sky-sail poles, I’d sway them up now.”\n\n“Sir!—in God’s name!—sir?”\n\n“Well.”\n\n“The anchors are working, sir. Shall I get them inboard?”\n\n“Strike nothing, and stir nothing, but lash everything. The wind rises, but it\nhas not got up to my table-lands yet. Quick, and see to it.—By masts and keels!\nhe takes me for the hunch-backed skipper of some coasting smack. Send down my\nmain-top-sail yard! Ho, gluepots! Loftiest trucks were made for wildest winds,\nand this brain-truck of mine now sails amid the cloud-scud. Shall I strike that?\nOh, none but cowards send down their brain-trucks in tempest time. What a\nhooroosh aloft there! I would e’en take it for sublime, did I not know that the\ncolic is a noisy malady. Oh, take medicine, take medicine!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 121. MIDNIGHT.—THE FORECASTLE BULWARKS.\n\nStubb and Flask mounted on them, and passing additional lashings over the\nanchors there hanging.\n\n“No, Stubb; you may pound that knot there as much as you please, but you will\nnever pound into me what you were just now saying. And how long ago is it since\nyou said the very contrary? Didn’t you once say that whatever ship Ahab sails\nin, that ship should pay something extra on its insurance policy, just as though\nit were loaded with powder barrels aft and boxes of lucifers forward? Stop, now;\ndidn’t you say so?”\n\n“Well, suppose I did? What then? I’ve part changed my flesh since that time, why\nnot my mind? Besides, supposing we are loaded with powder barrels aft and\nlucifers forward; how the devil could the lucifers get afire in this drenching\nspray here? Why, my little man, you have pretty red hair, but you couldn’t get\nafire now. Shake yourself; you’re Aquarius, or the water-bearer, Flask; might\nfill pitchers at your coat collar. Don’t you see, then, that for these extra\nrisks the Marine Insurance companies have extra guarantees? Here are hydrants,\nFlask. But hark, again, and I’ll answer ye the other thing. First take your leg\noff from the crown of the anchor here, though, so I can pass the rope; now\nlisten. What’s the mighty difference between holding a mast’s lightning-rod in\nthe storm, and standing close by a mast that hasn’t got any lightning-rod at all\nin a storm? Don’t you see, you timber-head, that no harm can come to the holder\nof the rod, unless the mast is first struck? What are you talking about, then?\nNot one ship in a hundred carries rods, and Ahab,—aye, man, and all of us,—were\nin no more danger then, in my poor opinion, than all the crews in ten thousand\nships now sailing the seas. Why, you King-Post, you, I suppose you would have\nevery man in the world go about with a small lightning-rod running up the corner\nof his hat, like a militia officer’s skewered feather, and trailing behind like\nhis sash. Why don’t ye be sensible, Flask? it’s easy to be sensible; why don’t\nye, then? any man with half an eye can be sensible.”\n\n“I don’t know that, Stubb. You sometimes find it rather hard.”\n\n“Yes, when a fellow’s soaked through, it’s hard to be sensible, that’s a fact.\nAnd I am about drenched with this spray. Never mind; catch the turn there, and\npass it. Seems to me we are lashing down these anchors now as if they were never\ngoing to be used again. Tying these two anchors here, Flask, seems like tying a\nman’s hands behind him. And what big generous hands they are, to be sure. These\nare your iron fists, hey? What a hold they have, too! I wonder, Flask, whether\nthe world is anchored anywhere; if she is, she swings with an uncommon long\ncable, though. There, hammer that knot down, and we’ve done. So; next to\ntouching land, lighting on deck is the most satisfactory. I say, just wring out\nmy jacket skirts, will ye? Thank ye. They laugh at long-togs so, Flask; but\nseems to me, a long tailed coat ought always to be worn in all storms afloat.\nThe tails tapering down that way, serve to carry off the water, d’ye see. Same\nwith cocked hats; the cocks form gable-end eave-troughs, Flask. No more\nmonkey-jackets and tarpaulins for me; I must mount a swallow-tail, and drive\ndown a beaver; so. Halloa! whew! there goes my tarpaulin overboard; Lord, Lord,\nthat the winds that come from heaven should be so unmannerly! This is a nasty\nnight, lad.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 122. MIDNIGHT ALOFT.—THUNDER AND LIGHTNING.\n\nThe main-top-sail yard.—Tashtego passing new lashings around it.\n\n“Um, um, um. Stop that thunder! Plenty too much thunder up here. What’s the use\nof thunder? Um, um, um. We don’t want thunder; we want rum; give us a glass of\nrum. Um, um, um!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 123. THE MUSKET.\n\nDuring the most violent shocks of the Typhoon, the man at the Pequod’s jaw-bone\ntiller had several times been reelingly hurled to the deck by its spasmodic\nmotions, even though preventer tackles had been attached to it—for they were\nslack—because some play to the tiller was indispensable.\n\nIn a severe gale like this, while the ship is but a tossed shuttlecock to the\nblast, it is by no means uncommon to see the needles in the compasses, at\nintervals, go round and round. It was thus with the Pequod’s; at almost every\nshock the helmsman had not failed to notice the whirling velocity with which\nthey revolved upon the cards; it is a sight that hardly anyone can behold\nwithout some sort of unwonted emotion.\n\nSome hours after midnight, the Typhoon abated so much, that through the\nstrenuous exertions of Starbuck and Stubb—one engaged forward and the other\naft—the shivered remnants of the jib and fore and main-top-sails were cut adrift\nfrom the spars, and went eddying away to leeward, like the feathers of an\nalbatross, which sometimes are cast to the winds when that storm-tossed bird is\non the wing.\n\nThe three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed, and a storm-trysail\nwas set further aft; so that the ship soon went through the water with some\nprecision again; and the course—for the present, East-south-east—which he was to\nsteer, if practicable, was once more given to the helmsman. For during the\nviolence of the gale, he had only steered according to its vicissitudes. But as\nhe was now bringing the ship as near her course as possible, watching the\ncompass meanwhile, lo! a good sign! the wind seemed coming round astern; aye,\nthe foul breeze became fair!\n\nInstantly the yards were squared, to the lively song of “Ho! the fair wind!\noh-ye-ho, cheerly men!” the crew singing for joy, that so promising an event\nshould so soon have falsified the evil portents preceding it.\n\nIn compliance with the standing order of his commander—to report immediately,\nand at any one of the twenty-four hours, any decided change in the affairs of\nthe deck,—Starbuck had no sooner trimmed the yards to the breeze—however\nreluctantly and gloomily,—than he mechanically went below to apprise Captain\nAhab of the circumstance.\n\nEre knocking at his state-room, he involuntarily paused before it a moment. The\ncabin lamp—taking long swings this way and that—was burning fitfully, and\ncasting fitful shadows upon the old man’s bolted door,—a thin one, with fixed\nblinds inserted, in place of upper panels. The isolated subterraneousness of the\ncabin made a certain humming silence to reign there, though it was hooped round\nby all the roar of the elements. The loaded muskets in the rack were shiningly\nrevealed, as they stood upright against the forward bulkhead. Starbuck was an\nhonest, upright man; but out of Starbuck’s heart, at that instant when he saw\nthe muskets, there strangely evolved an evil thought; but so blent with its\nneutral or good accompaniments that for the instant he hardly knew it for\nitself.\n\n“He would have shot me once,” he murmured, “yes, there’s the very musket that he\npointed at me;—that one with the studded stock; let me touch it—lift it.\nStrange, that I, who have handled so many deadly lances, strange, that I should\nshake so now. Loaded? I must see. Aye, aye; and powder in the pan;—that’s not\ngood. Best spill it?—wait. I’ll cure myself of this. I’ll hold the musket boldly\nwhile I think.—I come to report a fair wind to him. But how fair? Fair for death\nand doom,—that’s fair for Moby Dick. It’s a fair wind that’s only fair for that\naccursed fish.—The very tube he pointed at me!—the very one; this one—I hold it\nhere; he would have killed me with the very thing I handle now.—Aye and he would\nfain kill all his crew. Does he not say he will not strike his spars to any\ngale? Has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant? and in these same perilous seas,\ngropes he not his way by mere dead reckoning of the error-abounding log? and in\nthis very Typhoon, did he not swear that he would have no lightning-rods? But\nshall this crazed old man be tamely suffered to drag a whole ship’s company down\nto doom with him?—Yes, it would make him the wilful murderer of thirty men and\nmore, if this ship come to any deadly harm; and come to deadly harm, my soul\nswears this ship will, if Ahab have his way. If, then, he were this instant—put\naside, that crime would not be his. Ha! is he muttering in his sleep? Yes, just\nthere,—in there, he’s sleeping. Sleeping? aye, but still alive, and soon awake\nagain. I can’t withstand thee, then, old man. Not reasoning; not remonstrance;\nnot entreaty wilt thou hearken to; all this thou scornest. Flat obedience to thy\nown flat commands, this is all thou breathest. Aye, and say’st the men have\nvow’d thy vow; say’st all of us are Ahabs. Great God forbid!—But is there no\nother way? no lawful way?—Make him a prisoner to be taken home? What! hope to\nwrest this old man’s living power from his own living hands? Only a fool would\ntry it. Say he were pinioned even; knotted all over with ropes and hawsers;\nchained down to ring-bolts on this cabin floor; he would be more hideous than a\ncaged tiger, then. I could not endure the sight; could not possibly fly his\nhowlings; all comfort, sleep itself, inestimable reason would leave me on the\nlong intolerable voyage. What, then, remains? The land is hundreds of leagues\naway, and locked Japan the nearest. I stand alone here upon an open sea, with\ntwo oceans and a whole continent between me and law.—Aye, aye, ’tis so.—Is\nheaven a murderer when its lightning strikes a would-be murderer in his bed,\ntindering sheets and skin together?—And would I be a murderer, then, if”—and\nslowly, stealthily, and half sideways looking, he placed the loaded musket’s end\nagainst the door.\n\n“On this level, Ahab’s hammock swings within; his head this way. A touch, and\nStarbuck may survive to hug his wife and child again.—Oh Mary! Mary!—boy! boy!\nboy!—But if I wake thee not to death, old man, who can tell to what unsounded\ndeeps Starbuck’s body this day week may sink, with all the crew! Great God,\nwhere art Thou? Shall I? shall I?—The wind has gone down and shifted, sir; the\nfore and main topsails are reefed and set; she heads her course.”\n\n“Stern all! Oh Moby Dick, I clutch thy heart at last!”\n\nSuch were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the old man’s tormented\nsleep, as if Starbuck’s voice had caused the long dumb dream to speak.\n\nThe yet levelled musket shook like a drunkard’s arm against the panel; Starbuck\nseemed wrestling with an angel; but turning from the door, he placed the\ndeath-tube in its rack, and left the place.\n\n“He’s too sound asleep, Mr. Stubb; go thou down, and wake him, and tell him. I\nmust see to the deck here. Thou know’st what to say.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 124. THE NEEDLE.\n\nNext morning the not-yet-subsided sea rolled in long slow billows of mighty\nbulk, and striving in the Pequod’s gurgling track, pushed her on like giants’\npalms outspread. The strong, unstaggering breeze abounded so, that sky and air\nseemed vast outbellying sails; the whole world boomed before the wind. Muffled\nin the full morning light, the invisible sun was only known by the spread\nintensity of his place; where his bayonet rays moved on in stacks. Emblazonings,\nas of crowned Babylonian kings and queens, reigned over everything. The sea was\nas a crucible of molten gold, that bubblingly leaps with light and heat.\n\nLong maintaining an enchanted silence, Ahab stood apart; and every time the\ntetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit, he turned to eye the bright\nsun’s rays produced ahead; and when she profoundly settled by the stern, he\nturned behind, and saw the sun’s rearward place, and how the same yellow rays\nwere blending with his undeviating wake.\n\n“Ha, ha, my ship! thou mightest well be taken now for the sea-chariot of the\nsun. Ho, ho! all ye nations before my prow, I bring the sun to ye! Yoke on the\nfurther billows; hallo! a tandem, I drive the sea!”\n\nBut suddenly reined back by some counter thought, he hurried towards the helm,\nhuskily demanding how the ship was heading.\n\n“East-sou-east, sir,” said the frightened steersman.\n\n“Thou liest!” smiting him with his clenched fist. “Heading East at this hour in\nthe morning, and the sun astern?”\n\nUpon this every soul was confounded; for the phenomenon just then observed by\nAhab had unaccountably escaped every one else; but its very blinding\npalpableness must have been the cause.\n\nThrusting his head half way into the binnacle, Ahab caught one glimpse of the\ncompasses; his uplifted arm slowly fell; for a moment he almost seemed to\nstagger. Standing behind him Starbuck looked, and lo! the two compasses pointed\nEast, and the Pequod was as infallibly going West.\n\nBut ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew, the old man\nwith a rigid laugh exclaimed, “I have it! It has happened before. Mr. Starbuck,\nlast night’s thunder turned our compasses—that’s all. Thou hast before now heard\nof such a thing, I take it.”\n\n“Aye; but never before has it happened to me, sir,” said the pale mate,\ngloomily.\n\nHere, it must needs be said, that accidents like this have in more than one case\noccurred to ships in violent storms. The magnetic energy, as developed in the\nmariner’s needle, is, as all know, essentially one with the electricity beheld\nin heaven; hence it is not to be much marvelled at, that such things should be.\nInstances where the lightning has actually struck the vessel, so as to smite\ndown some of the spars and rigging, the effect upon the needle has at times been\nstill more fatal; all its loadstone virtue being annihilated, so that the before\nmagnetic steel was of no more use than an old wife’s knitting needle. But in\neither case, the needle never again, of itself, recovers the original virtue\nthus marred or lost; and if the binnacle compasses be affected, the same fate\nreaches all the others that may be in the ship; even were the lowermost one\ninserted into the kelson.\n\nDeliberately standing before the binnacle, and eyeing the transpointed\ncompasses, the old man, with the sharp of his extended hand, now took the\nprecise bearing of the sun, and satisfied that the needles were exactly\ninverted, shouted out his orders for the ship’s course to be changed\naccordingly. The yards were hard up; and once more the Pequod thrust her\nundaunted bows into the opposing wind, for the supposed fair one had only been\njuggling her.\n\nMeanwhile, whatever were his own secret thoughts, Starbuck said nothing, but\nquietly he issued all requisite orders; while Stubb and Flask—who in some small\ndegree seemed then to be sharing his feelings—likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced.\nAs for the men, though some of them lowly rumbled, their fear of Ahab was\ngreater than their fear of Fate. But as ever before, the pagan harpooneers\nremained almost wholly unimpressed; or if impressed, it was only with a certain\nmagnetism shot into their congenial hearts from inflexible Ahab’s.\n\nFor a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries. But chancing to\nslip with his ivory heel, he saw the crushed copper sight-tubes of the quadrant\nhe had the day before dashed to the deck.\n\n“Thou poor, proud heaven-gazer and sun’s pilot! yesterday I wrecked thee, and\nto-day the compasses would fain have wrecked me. So, so. But Ahab is lord over\nthe level loadstone yet. Mr. Starbuck—a lance without a pole; a top-maul, and\nthe smallest of the sail-maker’s needles. Quick!”\n\nAccessory, perhaps, to the impulse dictating the thing he was now about to do,\nwere certain prudential motives, whose object might have been to revive the\nspirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill, in a matter so wondrous as\nthat of the inverted compasses. Besides, the old man well knew that to steer by\ntranspointed needles, though clumsily practicable, was not a thing to be passed\nover by superstitious sailors, without some shudderings and evil portents.\n\n“Men,” said he, steadily turning upon the crew, as the mate handed him the\nthings he had demanded, “my men, the thunder turned old Ahab’s needles; but out\nof this bit of steel Ahab can make one of his own, that will point as true as\nany.”\n\nAbashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors, as this was\nsaid; and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic might follow. But\nStarbuck looked away.\n\nWith a blow from the top-maul Ahab knocked off the steel head of the lance, and\nthen handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining, bade him hold it upright,\nwithout its touching the deck. Then, with the maul, after repeatedly smiting the\nupper end of this iron rod, he placed the blunted needle endwise on the top of\nit, and less strongly hammered that, several times, the mate still holding the\nrod as before. Then going through some small strange motions with it—whether\nindispensable to the magnetizing of the steel, or merely intended to augment the\nawe of the crew, is uncertain—he called for linen thread; and moving to the\nbinnacle, slipped out the two reversed needles there, and horizontally suspended\nthe sail-needle by its middle, over one of the compass-cards. At first, the\nsteel went round and round, quivering and vibrating at either end; but at last\nit settled to its place, when Ahab, who had been intently watching for this\nresult, stepped frankly back from the binnacle, and pointing his stretched arm\ntowards it, exclaimed,—“Look ye, for yourselves, if Ahab be not lord of the\nlevel loadstone! The sun is East, and that compass swears it!”\n\nOne after another they peered in, for nothing but their own eyes could persuade\nsuch ignorance as theirs, and one after another they slunk away.\n\nIn his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph, you then saw Ahab in all his fatal\npride.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 125. THE LOG AND LINE.\n\nWhile now the fated Pequod had been so long afloat this voyage, the log and line\nhad but very seldom been in use. Owing to a confident reliance upon other means\nof determining the vessel’s place, some merchantmen, and many whalemen,\nespecially when cruising, wholly neglect to heave the log; though at the same\ntime, and frequently more for form’s sake than anything else, regularly putting\ndown upon the customary slate the course steered by the ship, as well as the\npresumed average rate of progression every hour. It had been thus with the\nPequod. The wooden reel and angular log attached hung, long untouched, just\nbeneath the railing of the after bulwarks. Rains and spray had damped it; sun\nand wind had warped it; all the elements had combined to rot a thing that hung\nso idly. But heedless of all this, his mood seized Ahab, as he happened to\nglance upon the reel, not many hours after the magnet scene, and he remembered\nhow his quadrant was no more, and recalled his frantic oath about the level log\nand line. The ship was sailing plungingly; astern the billows rolled in riots.\n\n“Forward, there! Heave the log!”\n\nTwo seamen came. The golden-hued Tahitian and the grizzly Manxman. “Take the\nreel, one of ye, I’ll heave.”\n\nThey went towards the extreme stern, on the ship’s lee side, where the deck,\nwith the oblique energy of the wind, was now almost dipping into the creamy,\nsidelong-rushing sea.\n\nThe Manxman took the reel, and holding it high up, by the projecting handle-ends\nof the spindle, round which the spool of line revolved, so stood with the\nangular log hanging downwards, till Ahab advanced to him.\n\nAhab stood before him, and was lightly unwinding some thirty or forty turns to\nform a preliminary hand-coil to toss overboard, when the old Manxman, who was\nintently eyeing both him and the line, made bold to speak.\n\n“Sir, I mistrust it; this line looks far gone, long heat and wet have spoiled\nit.”\n\n“’Twill hold, old gentleman. Long heat and wet, have they spoiled thee? Thou\nseem’st to hold. Or, truer perhaps, life holds thee; not thou it.”\n\n“I hold the spool, sir. But just as my captain says. With these grey hairs of\nmine ’tis not worth while disputing, ’specially with a superior, who’ll ne’er\nconfess.”\n\n“What’s that? There now’s a patched professor in Queen Nature’s granite-founded\nCollege; but methinks he’s too subservient. Where wert thou born?”\n\n“In the little rocky Isle of Man, sir.”\n\n“Excellent! Thou’st hit the world by that.”\n\n“I know not, sir, but I was born there.”\n\n“In the Isle of Man, hey? Well, the other way, it’s good. Here’s a man from Man;\na man born in once independent Man, and now unmanned of Man; which is sucked\nin—by what? Up with the reel! The dead, blind wall butts all inquiring heads at\nlast. Up with it! So.”\n\nThe log was heaved. The loose coils rapidly straightened out in a long dragging\nline astern, and then, instantly, the reel began to whirl. In turn, jerkingly\nraised and lowered by the rolling billows, the towing resistance of the log\ncaused the old reelman to stagger strangely.\n\n“Hold hard!”\n\nSnap! the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon; the tugging log was\ngone.\n\n“I crush the quadrant, the thunder turns the needles, and now the mad sea parts\nthe log-line. But Ahab can mend all. Haul in here, Tahitian; reel up, Manxman.\nAnd look ye, let the carpenter make another log, and mend thou the line. See to\nit.”\n\n“There he goes now; to him nothing’s happened; but to me, the skewer seems\nloosening out of the middle of the world. Haul in, haul in, Tahitian! These\nlines run whole, and whirling out: come in broken, and dragging slow. Ha, Pip?\ncome to help; eh, Pip?”\n\n“Pip? whom call ye Pip? Pip jumped from the whale-boat. Pip’s missing. Let’s see\nnow if ye haven’t fished him up here, fisherman. It drags hard; I guess he’s\nholding on. Jerk him, Tahiti! Jerk him off; we haul in no cowards here. Ho!\nthere’s his arm just breaking water. A hatchet! a hatchet! cut it off—we haul in\nno cowards here. Captain Ahab! sir, sir! here’s Pip, trying to get on board\nagain.”\n\n“Peace, thou crazy loon,” cried the Manxman, seizing him by the arm. “Away from\nthe quarter-deck!”\n\n“The greater idiot ever scolds the lesser,” muttered Ahab, advancing. “Hands off\nfrom that holiness! Where sayest thou Pip was, boy?\n\n“Astern there, sir, astern! Lo! lo!”\n\n“And who art thou, boy? I see not my reflection in the vacant pupils of thy\neyes. Oh God! that man should be a thing for immortal souls to sieve through!\nWho art thou, boy?”\n\n“Bell-boy, sir; ship’s-crier; ding, dong, ding! Pip! Pip! Pip! One hundred\npounds of clay reward for Pip; five feet high—looks cowardly—quickest known by\nthat! Ding, dong, ding! Who’s seen Pip the coward?”\n\n“There can be no hearts above the snow-line. Oh, ye frozen heavens! look down\nhere. Ye did beget this luckless child, and have abandoned him, ye creative\nlibertines. Here, boy; Ahab’s cabin shall be Pip’s home henceforth, while Ahab\nlives. Thou touchest my inmost centre, boy; thou art tied to me by cords woven\nof my heart-strings. Come, let’s down.”\n\n“What’s this? here’s velvet shark-skin,” intently gazing at Ahab’s hand, and\nfeeling it. “Ah, now, had poor Pip but felt so kind a thing as this, perhaps he\nhad ne’er been lost! This seems to me, sir, as a man-rope; something that weak\nsouls may hold by. Oh, sir, let old Perth now come and rivet these two hands\ntogether; the black one with the white, for I will not let this go.”\n\n“Oh, boy, nor will I thee, unless I should thereby drag thee to worse horrors\nthan are here. Come, then, to my cabin. Lo! ye believers in gods all goodness,\nand in man all ill, lo you! see the omniscient gods oblivious of suffering man;\nand man, though idiotic, and knowing not what he does, yet full of the sweet\nthings of love and gratitude. Come! I feel prouder leading thee by thy black\nhand, than though I grasped an Emperor’s!”\n\n“There go two daft ones now,” muttered the old Manxman. “One daft with strength,\nthe other daft with weakness. But here’s the end of the rotten line—all\ndripping, too. Mend it, eh? I think we had best have a new line altogether. I’ll\nsee Mr. Stubb about it.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 126. THE LIFE-BUOY.\n\nSteering now south-eastward by Ahab’s levelled steel, and her progress solely\ndetermined by Ahab’s level log and line; the Pequod held on her path towards the\nEquator. Making so long a passage through such unfrequented waters, descrying no\nships, and ere long, sideways impelled by unvarying trade winds, over waves\nmonotonously mild; all these seemed the strange calm things preluding some\nriotous and desperate scene.\n\nAt last, when the ship drew near to the outskirts, as it were, of the Equatorial\nfishing-ground, and in the deep darkness that goes before the dawn, was sailing\nby a cluster of rocky islets; the watch—then headed by Flask—was startled by a\ncry so plaintively wild and unearthly—like half-articulated wailings of the\nghosts of all Herod’s murdered Innocents—that one and all, they started from\ntheir reveries, and for the space of some moments stood, or sat, or leaned all\ntransfixedly listening, like the carved Roman slave, while that wild cry\nremained within hearing. The Christian or civilized part of the crew said it was\nmermaids, and shuddered; but the pagan harpooneers remained unappalled. Yet the\ngrey Manxman—the oldest mariner of all—declared that the wild thrilling sounds\nthat were heard, were the voices of newly drowned men in the sea.\n\nBelow in his hammock, Ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn, when he came to\nthe deck; it was then recounted to him by Flask, not unaccompanied with hinted\ndark meanings. He hollowly laughed, and thus explained the wonder.\n\nThose rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great numbers of\nseals, and some young seals that had lost their dams, or some dams that had lost\ntheir cubs, must have risen nigh the ship and kept company with her, crying and\nsobbing with their human sort of wail. But this only the more affected some of\nthem, because most mariners cherish a very superstitious feeling about seals,\narising not only from their peculiar tones when in distress, but also from the\nhuman look of their round heads and semi-intelligent faces, seen peeringly\nuprising from the water alongside. In the sea, under certain circumstances,\nseals have more than once been mistaken for men.\n\nBut the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible\nconfirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning. At sun-rise this\nman went from his hammock to his mast-head at the fore; and whether it was that\nhe was not yet half waked from his sleep (for sailors sometimes go aloft in a\ntransition state), whether it was thus with the man, there is now no telling;\nbut, be that as it may, he had not been long at his perch, when a cry was\nheard—a cry and a rushing—and looking up, they saw a falling phantom in the air;\nand looking down, a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of the sea.\n\nThe life-buoy—a long slender cask—was dropped from the stern, where it always\nhung obedient to a cunning spring; but no hand rose to seize it, and the sun\nhaving long beat upon this cask it had shrunken, so that it slowly filled, and\nthat parched wood also filled at its every pore; and the studded iron-bound cask\nfollowed the sailor to the bottom, as if to yield him his pillow, though in\nsooth but a hard one.\n\nAnd thus the first man of the Pequod that mounted the mast to look out for the\nWhite Whale, on the White Whale’s own peculiar ground; that man was swallowed up\nin the deep. But few, perhaps, thought of that at the time. Indeed, in some\nsort, they were not grieved at this event, at least as a portent; for they\nregarded it, not as a foreshadowing of evil in the future, but as the fulfilment\nof an evil already presaged. They declared that now they knew the reason of\nthose wild shrieks they had heard the night before. But again the old Manxman\nsaid nay.\n\nThe lost life-buoy was now to be replaced; Starbuck was directed to see to it;\nbut as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found, and as in the feverish\neagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of the voyage, all hands were\nimpatient of any toil but what was directly connected with its final end,\nwhatever that might prove to be; therefore, they were going to leave the ship’s\nstern unprovided with a buoy, when by certain strange signs and inuendoes\nQueequeg hinted a hint concerning his coffin.\n\n“A life-buoy of a coffin!” cried Starbuck, starting.\n\n“Rather queer, that, I should say,” said Stubb.\n\n“It will make a good enough one,” said Flask, “the carpenter here can arrange it\neasily.”\n\n“Bring it up; there’s nothing else for it,” said Starbuck, after a melancholy\npause. “Rig it, carpenter; do not look at me so—the coffin, I mean. Dost thou\nhear me? Rig it.”\n\n“And shall I nail down the lid, sir?” moving his hand as with a hammer.\n\n“Aye.”\n\n“And shall I caulk the seams, sir?” moving his hand as with a caulking-iron.\n\n“Aye.”\n\n“And shall I then pay over the same with pitch, sir?” moving his hand as with a\npitch-pot.\n\n“Away! what possesses thee to this? Make a life-buoy of the coffin, and no\nmore.—Mr. Stubb, Mr. Flask, come forward with me.”\n\n“He goes off in a huff. The whole he can endure; at the parts he baulks. Now I\ndon’t like this. I make a leg for Captain Ahab, and he wears it like a\ngentleman; but I make a bandbox for Queequeg, and he won’t put his head into it.\nAre all my pains to go for nothing with that coffin? And now I’m ordered to make\na life-buoy of it. It’s like turning an old coat; going to bring the flesh on\nthe other side now. I don’t like this cobbling sort of business—I don’t like it\nat all; it’s undignified; it’s not my place. Let tinkers’ brats do tinkerings;\nwe are their betters. I like to take in hand none but clean, virgin,\nfair-and-square mathematical jobs, something that regularly begins at the\nbeginning, and is at the middle when midway, and comes to an end at the\nconclusion; not a cobbler’s job, that’s at an end in the middle, and at the\nbeginning at the end. It’s the old woman’s tricks to be giving cobbling jobs.\nLord! what an affection all old women have for tinkers. I know an old woman of\nsixty-five who ran away with a bald-headed young tinker once. And that’s the\nreason I never would work for lonely widow old women ashore, when I kept my\njob-shop in the Vineyard; they might have taken it into their lonely old heads\nto run off with me. But heigh-ho! there are no caps at sea but snow-caps. Let me\nsee. Nail down the lid; caulk the seams; pay over the same with pitch; batten\nthem down tight, and hang it with the snap-spring over the ship’s stern. Were\never such things done before with a coffin? Some superstitious old carpenters,\nnow, would be tied up in the rigging, ere they would do the job. But I’m made of\nknotty Aroostook hemlock; I don’t budge. Cruppered with a coffin! Sailing about\nwith a grave-yard tray! But never mind. We workers in woods make\nbridal-bedsteads and card-tables, as well as coffins and hearses. We work by the\nmonth, or by the job, or by the profit; not for us to ask the why and wherefore\nof our work, unless it be too confounded cobbling, and then we stash it if we\ncan. Hem! I’ll do the job, now, tenderly. I’ll have me—let’s see—how many in the\nship’s company, all told? But I’ve forgotten. Any way, I’ll have me thirty\nseparate, Turk’s-headed life-lines, each three feet long hanging all round to\nthe coffin. Then, if the hull go down, there’ll be thirty lively fellows all\nfighting for one coffin, a sight not seen very often beneath the sun! Come\nhammer, caulking-iron, pitch-pot, and marling-spike! Let’s to it.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 127. THE DECK.\n\nThe coffin laid upon two line-tubs, between the vice-bench and the open\nhatchway; the Carpenter caulking its seams; the string of twisted oakum slowly\nunwinding from a large roll of it placed in the bosom of his frock.—Ahab comes\nslowly from the cabin-gangway, and hears Pip following him.\n\n“Back, lad; I will be with ye again presently. He goes! Not this hand complies\nwith my humor more genially than that boy.—Middle aisle of a church! What’s\nhere?”\n\n“Life-buoy, sir. Mr. Starbuck’s orders. Oh, look, sir! Beware the hatchway!”\n\n“Thank ye, man. Thy coffin lies handy to the vault.”\n\n“Sir? The hatchway? oh! So it does, sir, so it does.”\n\n“Art not thou the leg-maker? Look, did not this stump come from thy shop?”\n\n“I believe it did, sir; does the ferrule stand, sir?”\n\n“Well enough. But art thou not also the undertaker?”\n\n“Aye, sir; I patched up this thing here as a coffin for Queequeg; but they’ve\nset me now to turning it into something else.”\n\n“Then tell me; art thou not an arrant, all-grasping, intermeddling,\nmonopolising, heathenish old scamp, to be one day making legs, and the next day\ncoffins to clap them in, and yet again life-buoys out of those same coffins?\nThou art as unprincipled as the gods, and as much of a jack-of-all-trades.”\n\n“But I do not mean anything, sir. I do as I do.”\n\n“The gods again. Hark ye, dost thou not ever sing working about a coffin? The\nTitans, they say, hummed snatches when chipping out the craters for volcanoes;\nand the grave-digger in the play sings, spade in hand. Dost thou never?”\n\n“Sing, sir? Do I sing? Oh, I’m indifferent enough, sir, for that; but the reason\nwhy the grave-digger made music must have been because there was none in his\nspade, sir. But the caulking mallet is full of it. Hark to it.”\n\n“Aye, and that’s because the lid there’s a sounding-board; and what in all\nthings makes the sounding-board is this—there’s naught beneath. And yet, a\ncoffin with a body in it rings pretty much the same, Carpenter. Hast thou ever\nhelped carry a bier, and heard the coffin knock against the churchyard gate,\ngoing in?\n\n“Faith, sir, I’ve——”\n\n“Faith? What’s that?”\n\n“Why, faith, sir, it’s only a sort of exclamation-like—that’s all, sir.”\n\n“Um, um; go on.”\n\n“I was about to say, sir, that——”\n\n“Art thou a silk-worm? Dost thou spin thy own shroud out of thyself? Look at thy\nbosom! Despatch! and get these traps out of sight.”\n\n“He goes aft. That was sudden, now; but squalls come sudden in hot latitudes.\nI’ve heard that the Isle of Albemarle, one of the Gallipagos, is cut by the\nEquator right in the middle. Seems to me some sort of Equator cuts yon old man,\ntoo, right in his middle. He’s always under the Line—fiery hot, I tell ye! He’s\nlooking this way—come, oakum; quick. Here we go again. This wooden mallet is the\ncork, and I’m the professor of musical glasses—tap, tap!”\n\n(Ahab to himself.)\n\n“There’s a sight! There’s a sound! The greyheaded woodpecker tapping the hollow\ntree! Blind and dumb might well be envied now. See! that thing rests on two\nline-tubs, full of tow-lines. A most malicious wag, that fellow. Rat-tat! So\nman’s seconds tick! Oh! how immaterial are all materials! What things real are\nthere, but imponderable thoughts? Here now’s the very dreaded symbol of grim\ndeath, by a mere hap, made the expressive sign of the help and hope of most\nendangered life. A life-buoy of a coffin! Does it go further? Can it be that in\nsome spiritual sense the coffin is, after all, but an immortality-preserver!\nI’ll think of that. But no. So far gone am I in the dark side of earth, that its\nother side, the theoretic bright one, seems but uncertain twilight to me. Will\nye never have done, Carpenter, with that accursed sound? I go below; let me not\nsee that thing here when I return again. Now, then, Pip, we’ll talk this over; I\ndo suck most wondrous philosophies from thee! Some unknown conduits from the\nunknown worlds must empty into thee!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 128. THE PEQUOD MEETS THE RACHEL.\n\nNext day, a large ship, the Rachel, was descried, bearing directly down upon the\nPequod, all her spars thickly clustering with men. At the time the Pequod was\nmaking good speed through the water; but as the broad-winged windward stranger\nshot nigh to her, the boastful sails all fell together as blank bladders that\nare burst, and all life fled from the smitten hull.\n\n“Bad news; she brings bad news,” muttered the old Manxman. But ere her\ncommander, who, with trumpet to mouth, stood up in his boat; ere he could\nhopefully hail, Ahab’s voice was heard.\n\n“Hast seen the White Whale?”\n\n“Aye, yesterday. Have ye seen a whale-boat adrift?”\n\nThrottling his joy, Ahab negatively answered this unexpected question; and would\nthen have fain boarded the stranger, when the stranger captain himself, having\nstopped his vessel’s way, was seen descending her side. A few keen pulls, and\nhis boat-hook soon clinched the Pequod’s main-chains, and he sprang to the deck.\nImmediately he was recognised by Ahab for a Nantucketer he knew. But no formal\nsalutation was exchanged.\n\n“Where was he?—not killed!—not killed!” cried Ahab, closely advancing. “How was\nit?”\n\nIt seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous, while three\nof the stranger’s boats were engaged with a shoal of whales, which had led them\nsome four or five miles from the ship; and while they were yet in swift chase to\nwindward, the white hump and head of Moby Dick had suddenly loomed up out of the\nwater, not very far to leeward; whereupon, the fourth rigged boat—a reserved\none—had been instantly lowered in chase. After a keen sail before the wind, this\nfourth boat—the swiftest keeled of all—seemed to have succeeded in fastening—at\nleast, as well as the man at the mast-head could tell anything about it. In the\ndistance he saw the diminished dotted boat; and then a swift gleam of bubbling\nwhite water; and after that nothing more; whence it was concluded that the\nstricken whale must have indefinitely run away with his pursuers, as often\nhappens. There was some apprehension, but no positive alarm, as yet. The recall\nsignals were placed in the rigging; darkness came on; and forced to pick up her\nthree far to windward boats—ere going in quest of the fourth one in the\nprecisely opposite direction—the ship had not only been necessitated to leave\nthat boat to its fate till near midnight, but, for the time, to increase her\ndistance from it. But the rest of her crew being at last safe aboard, she\ncrowded all sail—stunsail on stunsail—after the missing boat; kindling a fire in\nher try-pots for a beacon; and every other man aloft on the look-out. But though\nwhen she had thus sailed a sufficient distance to gain the presumed place of the\nabsent ones when last seen; though she then paused to lower her spare boats to\npull all around her; and not finding anything, had again dashed on; again\npaused, and lowered her boats; and though she had thus continued doing till\ndaylight; yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had been seen.\n\nThe story told, the stranger Captain immediately went on to reveal his object in\nboarding the Pequod. He desired that ship to unite with his own in the search;\nby sailing over the sea some four or five miles apart, on parallel lines, and so\nsweeping a double horizon, as it were.\n\n“I will wager something now,” whispered Stubb to Flask, “that some one in that\nmissing boat wore off that Captain’s best coat; mayhap, his watch—he’s so cursed\nanxious to get it back. Who ever heard of two pious whale-ships cruising after\none missing whale-boat in the height of the whaling season? See, Flask, only see\nhow pale he looks—pale in the very buttons of his eyes—look—it wasn’t the\ncoat—it must have been the—”\n\n“My boy, my own boy is among them. For God’s sake—I beg, I conjure”—here\nexclaimed the stranger Captain to Ahab, who thus far had but icily received his\npetition. “For eight-and-forty hours let me charter your ship—I will gladly pay\nfor it, and roundly pay for it—if there be no other way—for eight-and-forty\nhours only—only that—you must, oh, you must, and you shall do this thing.”\n\n“His son!” cried Stubb, “oh, it’s his son he’s lost! I take back the coat and\nwatch—what says Ahab? We must save that boy.”\n\n“He’s drowned with the rest on ’em, last night,” said the old Manx sailor\nstanding behind them; “I heard; all of ye heard their spirits.”\n\nNow, as it shortly turned out, what made this incident of the Rachel’s the more\nmelancholy, was the circumstance, that not only was one of the Captain’s sons\namong the number of the missing boat’s crew; but among the number of the other\nboat’s crews, at the same time, but on the other hand, separated from the ship\nduring the dark vicissitudes of the chase, there had been still another son; as\nthat for a time, the wretched father was plunged to the bottom of the cruellest\nperplexity; which was only solved for him by his chief mate’s instinctively\nadopting the ordinary procedure of a whale-ship in such emergencies, that is,\nwhen placed between jeopardized but divided boats, always to pick up the\nmajority first. But the captain, for some unknown constitutional reason, had\nrefrained from mentioning all this, and not till forced to it by Ahab’s iciness\ndid he allude to his one yet missing boy; a little lad, but twelve years old,\nwhose father with the earnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a Nantucketer’s\npaternal love, had thus early sought to initiate him in the perils and wonders\nof a vocation almost immemorially the destiny of all his race. Nor does it\nunfrequently occur, that Nantucket captains will send a son of such tender age\naway from them, for a protracted three or four years’ voyage in some other ship\nthan their own; so that their first knowledge of a whaleman’s career shall be\nunenervated by any chance display of a father’s natural but untimely partiality,\nor undue apprehensiveness and concern.\n\nMeantime, now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of Ahab; and Ahab\nstill stood like an anvil, receiving every shock, but without the least\nquivering of his own.\n\n“I will not go,” said the stranger, “till you say aye to me. Do to me as you\nwould have me do to you in the like case. For you too have a boy, Captain\nAhab—though but a child, and nestling safely at home now—a child of your old age\ntoo—Yes, yes, you relent; I see it—run, run, men, now, and stand by to square in\nthe yards.”\n\n“Avast,” cried Ahab—“touch not a rope-yarn”; then in a voice that prolongingly\nmoulded every word—“Captain Gardiner, I will not do it. Even now I lose time.\nGood-bye, good-bye. God bless ye, man, and may I forgive myself, but I must go.\nMr. Starbuck, look at the binnacle watch, and in three minutes from this present\ninstant warn off all strangers: then brace forward again, and let the ship sail\nas before.”\n\nHurriedly turning, with averted face, he descended into his cabin, leaving the\nstrange captain transfixed at this unconditional and utter rejection of his so\nearnest suit. But starting from his enchantment, Gardiner silently hurried to\nthe side; more fell than stepped into his boat, and returned to his ship.\n\nSoon the two ships diverged their wakes; and long as the strange vessel was in\nview, she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot, however small,\non the sea. This way and that her yards were swung round; starboard and\nlarboard, she continued to tack; now she beat against a head sea; and again it\npushed her before it; while all the while, her masts and yards were thickly\nclustered with men, as three tall cherry trees, when the boys are cherrying\namong the boughs.\n\nBut by her still halting course and winding, woeful way, you plainly saw that\nthis ship that so wept with spray, still remained without comfort. She was\nRachel, weeping for her children, because they were not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 129. THE CABIN.\n\n(Ahab moving to go on deck; Pip catches him by the hand to follow.)\n\n“Lad, lad, I tell thee thou must not follow Ahab now. The hour is coming when\nAhab would not scare thee from him, yet would not have thee by him. There is\nthat in thee, poor lad, which I feel too curing to my malady. Like cures like;\nand for this hunt, my malady becomes my most desired health. Do thou abide below\nhere, where they shall serve thee, as if thou wert the captain. Aye, lad, thou\nshalt sit here in my own screwed chair; another screw to it, thou must be.”\n\n“No, no, no! ye have not a whole body, sir; do ye but use poor me for your one\nlost leg; only tread upon me, sir; I ask no more, so I remain a part of ye.”\n\n“Oh! spite of million villains, this makes me a bigot in the fadeless fidelity\nof man!—and a black! and crazy!—but methinks like-cures-like applies to him too;\nhe grows so sane again.”\n\n“They tell me, sir, that Stubb did once desert poor little Pip, whose drowned\nbones now show white, for all the blackness of his living skin. But I will never\ndesert ye, sir, as Stubb did him. Sir, I must go with ye.”\n\n“If thou speakest thus to me much more, Ahab’s purpose keels up in him. I tell\nthee no; it cannot be.”\n\n“Oh good master, master, master!\n\n“Weep so, and I will murder thee! have a care, for Ahab too is mad. Listen, and\nthou wilt often hear my ivory foot upon the deck, and still know that I am\nthere. And now I quit thee. Thy hand!—Met! True art thou, lad, as the\ncircumference to its centre. So: God for ever bless thee; and if it come to\nthat,—God for ever save thee, let what will befall.”\n\n(Ahab goes; Pip steps one step forward.)\n\n“Here he this instant stood; I stand in his air,—but I’m alone. Now were even\npoor Pip here I could endure it, but he’s missing. Pip! Pip! Ding, dong, ding!\nWho’s seen Pip? He must be up here; let’s try the door. What? neither lock, nor\nbolt, nor bar; and yet there’s no opening it. It must be the spell; he told me\nto stay here: Aye, and told me this screwed chair was mine. Here, then, I’ll\nseat me, against the transom, in the ship’s full middle, all her keel and her\nthree masts before me. Here, our old sailors say, in their black seventy-fours\ngreat admirals sometimes sit at table, and lord it over rows of captains and\nlieutenants. Ha! what’s this? epaulets! epaulets! the epaulets all come\ncrowding! Pass round the decanters; glad to see ye; fill up, monsieurs! What an\nodd feeling, now, when a black boy’s host to white men with gold lace upon their\ncoats!—Monsieurs, have ye seen one Pip?—a little negro lad, five feet high,\nhang-dog look, and cowardly! Jumped from a whale-boat once;—seen him? No! Well\nthen, fill up again, captains, and let’s drink shame upon all cowards! I name no\nnames. Shame upon them! Put one foot upon the table. Shame upon all\ncowards.—Hist! above there, I hear ivory—Oh, master! master! I am indeed\ndown-hearted when you walk over me. But here I’ll stay, though this stern\nstrikes rocks; and they bulge through; and oysters come to join me.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 130. THE HAT.\n\nAnd now that at the proper time and place, after so long and wide a preliminary\ncruise, Ahab,—all other whaling waters swept—seemed to have chased his foe into\nan ocean-fold, to slay him the more securely there; now, that he found himself\nhard by the very latitude and longitude where his tormenting wound had been\ninflicted; now that a vessel had been spoken which on the very day preceding had\nactually encountered Moby Dick;—and now that all his successive meetings with\nvarious ships contrastingly concurred to show the demoniac indifference with\nwhich the white whale tore his hunters, whether sinning or sinned against; now\nit was that there lurked a something in the old man’s eyes, which it was hardly\nsufferable for feeble souls to see. As the unsetting polar star, which through\nthe livelong, arctic, six months’ night sustains its piercing, steady, central\ngaze; so Ahab’s purpose now fixedly gleamed down upon the constant midnight of\nthe gloomy crew. It domineered above them so, that all their bodings, doubts,\nmisgivings, fears, were fain to hide beneath their souls, and not sprout forth a\nsingle spear or leaf.\n\nIn this foreshadowing interval too, all humor, forced or natural, vanished.\nStubb no more strove to raise a smile; Starbuck no more strove to check one.\nAlike, joy and sorrow, hope and fear, seemed ground to finest dust, and\npowdered, for the time, in the clamped mortar of Ahab’s iron soul. Like\nmachines, they dumbly moved about the deck, ever conscious that the old man’s\ndespot eye was on them.\n\nBut did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours; when he\nthought no glance but one was on him; then you would have seen that even as\nAhab’s eyes so awed the crew’s, the inscrutable Parsee’s glance awed his; or\nsomehow, at least, in some wild way, at times affected it. Such an added,\ngliding strangeness began to invest the thin Fedallah now; such ceaseless\nshudderings shook him; that the men looked dubious at him; half uncertain, as it\nseemed, whether indeed he were a mortal substance, or else a tremulous shadow\ncast upon the deck by some unseen being’s body. And that shadow was always\nhovering there. For not by night, even, had Fedallah ever certainly been known\nto slumber, or go below. He would stand still for hours: but never sat or\nleaned; his wan but wondrous eyes did plainly say—We two watchmen never rest.\n\nNor, at any time, by night or day could the mariners now step upon the deck,\nunless Ahab was before them; either standing in his pivot-hole, or exactly\npacing the planks between two undeviating limits,—the main-mast and the mizen;\nor else they saw him standing in the cabin-scuttle,—his living foot advanced\nupon the deck, as if to step; his hat slouched heavily over his eyes; so that\nhowever motionless he stood, however the days and nights were added on, that he\nhad not swung in his hammock; yet hidden beneath that slouching hat, they could\nnever tell unerringly whether, for all this, his eyes were really closed at\ntimes; or whether he was still intently scanning them; no matter, though he\nstood so in the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch, and the unheeded\nnight-damp gathered in beads of dew upon that stone-carved coat and hat. The\nclothes that the night had wet, the next day’s sunshine dried upon him; and so,\nday after day, and night after night; he went no more beneath the planks;\nwhatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent for.\n\nHe ate in the same open air; that is, his two only meals,—breakfast and dinner:\nsupper he never touched; nor reaped his beard; which darkly grew all gnarled, as\nunearthed roots of trees blown over, which still grow idly on at naked base,\nthough perished in the upper verdure. But though his whole life was now become\none watch on deck; and though the Parsee’s mystic watch was without intermission\nas his own; yet these two never seemed to speak—one man to the other—unless at\nlong intervals some passing unmomentous matter made it necessary. Though such a\npotent spell seemed secretly to join the twain; openly, and to the awe-struck\ncrew, they seemed pole-like asunder. If by day they chanced to speak one word;\nby night, dumb men were both, so far as concerned the slightest verbal\ninterchange. At times, for longest hours, without a single hail, they stood far\nparted in the starlight; Ahab in his scuttle, the Parsee by the mainmast; but\nstill fixedly gazing upon each other; as if in the Parsee Ahab saw his\nforethrown shadow, in Ahab the Parsee his abandoned substance.\n\nAnd yet, somehow, did Ahab—in his own proper self, as daily, hourly, and every\ninstant, commandingly revealed to his subordinates,—Ahab seemed an independent\nlord; the Parsee but his slave. Still again both seemed yoked together, and an\nunseen tyrant driving them; the lean shade siding the solid rib. For be this\nParsee what he may, all rib and keel was solid Ahab.\n\nAt the first faintest glimmering of the dawn, his iron voice was heard from\naft,—“Man the mast-heads!”—and all through the day, till after sunset and after\ntwilight, the same voice every hour, at the striking of the helmsman’s bell, was\nheard—“What d’ye see?—sharp! sharp!”\n\nBut when three or four days had slided by, after meeting the children-seeking\nRachel; and no spout had yet been seen; the monomaniac old man seemed\ndistrustful of his crew’s fidelity; at least, of nearly all except the Pagan\nharpooneers; he seemed to doubt, even, whether Stubb and Flask might not\nwillingly overlook the sight he sought. But if these suspicions were really his,\nhe sagaciously refrained from verbally expressing them, however his actions\nmight seem to hint them.\n\n“I will have the first sight of the whale myself,”—he said. “Aye! Ahab must have\nthe doubloon!” and with his own hands he rigged a nest of basketed bowlines; and\nsending a hand aloft, with a single sheaved block, to secure to the main-mast\nhead, he received the two ends of the downward-reeved rope; and attaching one to\nhis basket prepared a pin for the other end, in order to fasten it at the rail.\nThis done, with that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin, he looked\nround upon his crew, sweeping from one to the other; pausing his glance long\nupon Daggoo, Queequeg, Tashtego; but shunning Fedallah; and then settling his\nfirm relying eye upon the chief mate, said,—“Take the rope, sir—I give it into\nthy hands, Starbuck.” Then arranging his person in the basket, he gave the word\nfor them to hoist him to his perch, Starbuck being the one who secured the rope\nat last; and afterwards stood near it. And thus, with one hand clinging round\nthe royal mast, Ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and miles,—ahead,\nastern, this side, and that,—within the wide expanded circle commanded at so\ngreat a height.\n\nWhen in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in the\nrigging, which chances to afford no foothold, the sailor at sea is hoisted up to\nthat spot, and sustained there by the rope; under these circumstances, its\nfastened end on deck is always given in strict charge to some one man who has\nthe special watch of it. Because in such a wilderness of running rigging, whose\nvarious different relations aloft cannot always be infallibly discerned by what\nis seen of them at the deck; and when the deck-ends of these ropes are being\nevery few minutes cast down from the fastenings, it would be but a natural\nfatality, if, unprovided with a constant watchman, the hoisted sailor should by\nsome carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea.\nSo Ahab’s proceedings in this matter were not unusual; the only strange thing\nabout them seemed to be, that Starbuck, almost the one only man who had ever\nventured to oppose him with anything in the slightest degree approaching to\ndecision—one of those too, whose faithfulness on the look-out he had seemed to\ndoubt somewhat;—it was strange, that this was the very man he should select for\nhis watchman; freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise distrusted\nperson’s hands.\n\nNow, the first time Ahab was perched aloft; ere he had been there ten minutes;\none of those red-billed savage sea-hawks which so often fly incommodiously close\nround the manned mast-heads of whalemen in these latitudes; one of these birds\ncame wheeling and screaming round his head in a maze of untrackably swift\ncirclings. Then it darted a thousand feet straight up into the air; then\nspiralized downwards, and went eddying again round his head.\n\nBut with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon, Ahab seemed not to\nmark this wild bird; nor, indeed, would any one else have marked it much, it\nbeing no uncommon circumstance; only now almost the least heedful eye seemed to\nsee some sort of cunning meaning in almost every sight.\n\n“Your hat, your hat, sir!” suddenly cried the Sicilian seaman, who being posted\nat the mizen-mast-head, stood directly behind Ahab, though somewhat lower than\nhis level, and with a deep gulf of air dividing them.\n\nBut already the sable wing was before the old man’s eyes; the long hooked bill\nat his head: with a scream, the black hawk darted away with his prize.\n\nAn eagle flew thrice round Tarquin’s head, removing his cap to replace it, and\nthereupon Tanaquil, his wife, declared that Tarquin would be king of Rome. But\nonly by the replacing of the cap was that omen accounted good. Ahab’s hat was\nnever restored; the wild hawk flew on and on with it; far in advance of the\nprow: and at last disappeared; while from the point of that disappearance, a\nminute black spot was dimly discerned, falling from that vast height into the\nsea.\n\n"},{"title":"Test Section Title","content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 22. MERRY CHRISTMAS.\n\nAt length, towards noon, upon the final dismissal of the ship’s riggers, and\nafter the Pequod had been hauled out from the wharf, and after the\never-thoughtful Charity had come off in a whale-boat, with her last gift—a\nnight-cap for Stubb, the second mate, her brother-in-law, and a spare Bible for\nthe steward—after all this, the two Captains, Peleg and Bildad, issued from the\ncabin, and turning to the chief mate, Peleg said:\n\n“Now, Mr. Starbuck, are you sure everything is right? Captain Ahab is all\nready—just spoke to him—nothing more to be got from shore, eh? Well, call all\nhands, then. Muster ’em aft here—blast ’em!”\n\n“No need of profane words, however great the hurry, Peleg,” said Bildad, “but\naway with thee, friend Starbuck, and do our bidding.”\n\nHow now! Here upon the very point of starting for the voyage, Captain Peleg and\nCaptain Bildad were going it with a high hand on the quarter-deck, just as if\nthey were to be joint-commanders at sea, as well as to all appearances in port.\nAnd, as for Captain Ahab, no sign of him was yet to be seen; only, they said he\nwas in the cabin. But then, the idea was, that his presence was by no means\nnecessary in getting the ship under weigh, and steering her well out to sea.\nIndeed, as that was not at all his proper business, but the pilot’s; and as he\nwas not yet completely recovered—so they said—therefore, Captain Ahab stayed\nbelow. And all this seemed natural enough; especially as in the merchant service\nmany captains never show themselves on deck for a considerable time after\nheaving up the anchor, but remain over the cabin table, having a farewell\nmerry-making with their shore friends, before they quit the ship for good with\nthe pilot.\n\nBut there was not much chance to think over the matter, for Captain Peleg was\nnow all alive. He seemed to do most of the talking and commanding, and not\nBildad.\n\n“Aft here, ye sons of bachelors,” he cried, as the sailors lingered at the\nmain-mast. “Mr. Starbuck, drive ’em aft.”\n\n“Strike the tent there!”—was the next order. As I hinted before, this whalebone\nmarquee was never pitched except in port; and on board the Pequod, for thirty\nyears, the order to strike the tent was well known to be the next thing to\nheaving up the anchor.\n\n“Man the capstan! Blood and thunder!—jump!”—was the next command, and the crew\nsprang for the handspikes.\n\nNow in getting under weigh, the station generally occupied by the pilot is the\nforward part of the ship. And here Bildad, who, with Peleg, be it known, in\naddition to his other officers, was one of the licensed pilots of the port—he\nbeing suspected to have got himself made a pilot in order to save the Nantucket\npilot-fee to all the ships he was concerned in, for he never piloted any other\ncraft—Bildad, I say, might now be seen actively engaged in looking over the bows\nfor the approaching anchor, and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave\nof psalmody, to cheer the hands at the windlass, who roared forth some sort of a\nchorus about the girls in Booble Alley, with hearty good will. Nevertheless, not\nthree days previous, Bildad had told them that no profane songs would be allowed\non board the Pequod, particularly in getting under weigh; and Charity, his\nsister, had placed a small choice copy of Watts in each seaman’s berth.\n\nMeantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, Captain Peleg ripped and swore\nastern in the most frightful manner. I almost thought he would sink the ship\nbefore the anchor could be got up; involuntarily I paused on my handspike, and\ntold Queequeg to do the same, thinking of the perils we both ran, in starting on\nthe voyage with such a devil for a pilot. I was comforting myself, however, with\nthe thought that in pious Bildad might be found some salvation, spite of his\nseven hundred and seventy-seventh lay; when I felt a sudden sharp poke in my\nrear, and turning round, was horrified at the apparition of Captain Peleg in the\nact of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity. That was my first kick.\n\n“Is that the way they heave in the marchant service?” he roared. “Spring, thou\nsheep-head; spring, and break thy backbone! Why don’t ye spring, I say, all of\nye—spring! Quohog! spring, thou chap with the red whiskers; spring there,\nScotch-cap; spring, thou green pants. Spring, I say, all of ye, and spring your\neyes out!” And so saying, he moved along the windlass, here and there using his\nleg very freely, while imperturbable Bildad kept leading off with his psalmody.\nThinks I, Captain Peleg must have been drinking something to-day.\n\nAt last the anchor was up, the sails were set, and off we glided. It was a\nshort, cold Christmas; and as the short northern day merged into night, we found\nourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean, whose freezing spray cased us in\nice, as in polished armor. The long rows of teeth on the bulwarks glistened in\nthe moonlight; and like the white ivory tusks of some huge elephant, vast\ncurving icicles depended from the bows.\n\nLank Bildad, as pilot, headed the first watch, and ever and anon, as the old\ncraft deep dived into the green seas, and sent the shivering frost all over her,\nand the winds howled, and the cordage rang, his steady notes were heard,—\n\n      “Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood,\n         Stand dressed in living green.\n      So to the Jews old Canaan stood,\n         While Jordan rolled between.”\n\n\nNever did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then. They were full\nof hope and fruition. Spite of this frigid winter night in the boisterous\nAtlantic, spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket, there was yet, it then seemed\nto me, many a pleasant haven in store; and meads and glades so eternally vernal,\nthat the grass shot up by the spring, untrodden, unwilted, remains at midsummer.\n\nAt last we gained such an offing, that the two pilots were needed no longer. The\nstout sail-boat that had accompanied us began ranging alongside.\n\nIt was curious and not unpleasing, how Peleg and Bildad were affected at this\njuncture, especially Captain Bildad. For loath to depart, yet; very loath to\nleave, for good, a ship bound on so long and perilous a voyage—beyond both\nstormy Capes; a ship in which some thousands of his hard earned dollars were\ninvested; a ship, in which an old shipmate sailed as captain; a man almost as\nold as he, once more starting to encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw;\nloath to say good-bye to a thing so every way brimful of every interest to\nhim,—poor old Bildad lingered long; paced the deck with anxious strides; ran\ndown into the cabin to speak another farewell word there; again came on deck,\nand looked to windward; looked towards the wide and endless waters, only bounded\nby the far-off unseen Eastern Continents; looked towards the land; looked aloft;\nlooked right and left; looked everywhere and nowhere; and at last, mechanically\ncoiling a rope upon its pin, convulsively grasped stout Peleg by the hand, and\nholding up a lantern, for a moment stood gazing heroically in his face, as much\nas to say, “Nevertheless, friend Peleg, I can stand it; yes, I can.”\n\nAs for Peleg himself, he took it more like a philosopher; but for all his\nphilosophy, there was a tear twinkling in his eye, when the lantern came too\nnear. And he, too, did not a little run from cabin to deck—now a word below, and\nnow a word with Starbuck, the chief mate.\n\nBut, at last, he turned to his comrade, with a final sort of look about\nhim,—“Captain Bildad—come, old shipmate, we must go. Back the main-yard there!\nBoat ahoy! Stand by to come close alongside, now! Careful, careful!—come,\nBildad, boy—say your last. Luck to ye, Starbuck—luck to ye, Mr. Stubb—luck to\nye, Mr. Flask—good-bye and good luck to ye all—and this day three years I’ll\nhave a hot supper smoking for ye in old Nantucket. Hurrah and away!”\n\n“God bless ye, and have ye in His holy keeping, men,” murmured old Bildad,\nalmost incoherently. “I hope ye’ll have fine weather now, so that Captain Ahab\nmay soon be moving among ye—a pleasant sun is all he needs, and ye’ll have\nplenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go. Be careful in the hunt, ye mates.\nDon’t stave the boats needlessly, ye harpooneers; good white cedar plank is\nraised full three per cent. within the year. Don’t forget your prayers, either.\nMr. Starbuck, mind that cooper don’t waste the spare staves. Oh! the\nsail-needles are in the green locker! Don’t whale it too much a’ Lord’s days,\nmen; but don’t miss a fair chance either, that’s rejecting Heaven’s good gifts.\nHave an eye to the molasses tierce, Mr. Stubb; it was a little leaky, I thought.\nIf ye touch at the islands, Mr. Flask, beware of fornication. Good-bye,\ngood-bye! Don’t keep that cheese too long down in the hold, Mr. Starbuck; it’ll\nspoil. Be careful with the butter—twenty cents the pound it was, and mind ye,\nif—”\n\n“Come, come, Captain Bildad; stop palavering,—away!” and with that, Peleg\nhurried him over the side, and both dropt into the boat.\n\nShip and boat diverged; the cold, damp night breeze blew between; a screaming\ngull flew overhead; the two hulls wildly rolled; we gave three heavy-hearted\ncheers, and blindly plunged like fate into the lone Atlantic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 23. THE LEE SHORE.\n\nSome chapters back, one Bulkington was spoken of, a tall, newlanded mariner,\nencountered in New Bedford at the inn.\n\nWhen on that shivering winter’s night, the Pequod thrust her vindictive bows\ninto the cold malicious waves, who should I see standing at her helm but\nBulkington! I looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon the man, who in\nmid-winter just landed from a four years’ dangerous voyage, could so unrestingly\npush off again for still another tempestuous term. The land seemed scorching to\nhis feet. Wonderfullest things are ever the unmentionable; deep memories yield\nno epitaphs; this six-inch chapter is the stoneless grave of Bulkington. Let me\nonly say that it fared with him as with the storm-tossed ship, that miserably\ndrives along the leeward land. The port would fain give succor; the port is\npitiful; in the port is safety, comfort, hearthstone, supper, warm blankets,\nfriends, all that’s kind to our mortalities. But in that gale, the port, the\nland, is that ship’s direst jeopardy; she must fly all hospitality; one touch of\nland, though it but graze the keel, would make her shudder through and through.\nWith all her might she crowds all sail off shore; in so doing, fights ’gainst\nthe very winds that fain would blow her homeward; seeks all the lashed sea’s\nlandlessness again; for refuge’s sake forlornly rushing into peril; her only\nfriend her bitterest foe!\n\nKnow ye now, Bulkington? Glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally intolerable\ntruth; that all deep, earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the soul to\nkeep the open independence of her sea; while the wildest winds of heaven and\nearth conspire to cast her on the treacherous, slavish shore?\n\nBut as in landlessness alone resides highest truth, shoreless, indefinite as\nGod—so, better is it to perish in that howling infinite, than be ingloriously\ndashed upon the lee, even if that were safety! For worm-like, then, oh! who\nwould craven crawl to land! Terrors of the terrible! is all this agony so vain?\nTake heart, take heart, O Bulkington! Bear thee grimly, demigod! Up from the\nspray of thy ocean-perishing—straight up, leaps thy apotheosis!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 24. THE ADVOCATE.\n\nAs Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling; and as\nthis business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among landsmen as a\nrather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit; therefore, I am all anxiety to\nconvince ye, ye landsmen, of the injustice hereby done to us hunters of whales.\n\nIn the first place, it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish the fact,\nthat among people at large, the business of whaling is not accounted on a level\nwith what are called the liberal professions. If a stranger were introduced into\nany miscellaneous metropolitan society, it would but slightly advance the\ngeneral opinion of his merits, were he presented to the company as a harpooneer,\nsay; and if in emulation of the naval officers he should append the initials\nS.W.F. (Sperm Whale Fishery) to his visiting card, such a procedure would be\ndeemed pre-eminently presuming and ridiculous.\n\nDoubtless one leading reason why the world declines honoring us whalemen, is\nthis: they think that, at best, our vocation amounts to a butchering sort of\nbusiness; and that when actively engaged therein, we are surrounded by all\nmanner of defilements. Butchers we are, that is true. But butchers, also, and\nbutchers of the bloodiest badge have been all Martial Commanders whom the world\ninvariably delights to honor. And as for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness\nof our business, ye shall soon be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty\ngenerally unknown, and which, upon the whole, will triumphantly plant the sperm\nwhale-ship at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth. But even\ngranting the charge in question to be true; what disordered slippery decks of a\nwhale-ship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those battle-fields from\nwhich so many soldiers return to drink in all ladies’ plaudits? And if the idea\nof peril so much enhances the popular conceit of the soldier’s profession; let\nme assure ye that many a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery, would\nquickly recoil at the apparition of the sperm whale’s vast tail, fanning into\neddies the air over his head. For what are the comprehensible terrors of man\ncompared with the interlinked terrors and wonders of God!\n\nBut, though the world scouts at us whale hunters, yet does it unwittingly pay us\nthe profoundest homage; yea, an all-abounding adoration! for almost all the\ntapers, lamps, and candles that burn round the globe, burn, as before so many\nshrines, to our glory!\n\nBut look at this matter in other lights; weigh it in all sorts of scales; see\nwhat we whalemen are, and have been.\n\nWhy did the Dutch in De Witt’s time have admirals of their whaling fleets? Why\ndid Louis XVI. of France, at his own personal expense, fit out whaling ships\nfrom Dunkirk, and politely invite to that town some score or two of families\nfrom our own island of Nantucket? Why did Britain between the years 1750 and\n1788 pay to her whalemen in bounties upwards of £1,000,000? And lastly, how\ncomes it that we whalemen of America now outnumber all the rest of the banded\nwhalemen in the world; sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels; manned\nby eighteen thousand men; yearly consuming 4,000,000 of dollars; the ships\nworth, at the time of sailing, $20,000,000! and every year importing into our\nharbors a well reaped harvest of $7,000,000. How comes all this, if there be not\nsomething puissant in whaling?\n\nBut this is not the half; look again.\n\nI freely assert, that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot, for his life, point\nout one single peaceful influence, which within the last sixty years has\noperated more potentially upon the whole broad world, taken in one aggregate,\nthan the high and mighty business of whaling. One way and another, it has\nbegotten events so remarkable in themselves, and so continuously momentous in\ntheir sequential issues, that whaling may well be regarded as that Egyptian\nmother, who bore offspring themselves pregnant from her womb. It would be a\nhopeless, endless task to catalogue all these things. Let a handful suffice. For\nmany years past the whale-ship has been the pioneer in ferreting out the\nremotest and least known parts of the earth. She has explored seas and\narchipelagoes which had no chart, where no Cook or Vancouver had ever sailed. If\nAmerican and European men-of-war now peacefully ride in once savage harbors, let\nthem fire salutes to the honor and glory of the whale-ship, which originally\nshowed them the way, and first interpreted between them and the savages. They\nmay celebrate as they will the heroes of Exploring Expeditions, your Cooks, your\nKrusensterns; but I say that scores of anonymous Captains have sailed out of\nNantucket, that were as great, and greater than your Cook and your Krusenstern.\nFor in their succourless empty-handedness, they, in the heathenish sharked\nwaters, and by the beaches of unrecorded, javelin islands, battled with virgin\nwonders and terrors that Cook with all his marines and muskets would not\nwillingly have dared. All that is made such a flourish of in the old South Sea\nVoyages, those things were but the life-time commonplaces of our heroic\nNantucketers. Often, adventures which Vancouver dedicates three chapters to,\nthese men accounted unworthy of being set down in the ship’s common log. Ah, the\nworld! Oh, the world!\n\nUntil the whale fishery rounded Cape Horn, no commerce but colonial, scarcely\nany intercourse but colonial, was carried on between Europe and the long line of\nthe opulent Spanish provinces on the Pacific coast. It was the whaleman who\nfirst broke through the jealous policy of the Spanish crown, touching those\ncolonies; and, if space permitted, it might be distinctly shown how from those\nwhalemen at last eventuated the liberation of Peru, Chili, and Bolivia from the\nyoke of Old Spain, and the establishment of the eternal democracy in those\nparts.\n\nThat great America on the other side of the sphere, Australia, was given to the\nenlightened world by the whaleman. After its first blunder-born discovery by a\nDutchman, all other ships long shunned those shores as pestiferously barbarous;\nbut the whale-ship touched there. The whale-ship is the true mother of that now\nmighty colony. Moreover, in the infancy of the first Australian settlement, the\nemigrants were several times saved from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of\nthe whale-ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters. The uncounted isles\nof all Polynesia confess the same truth, and do commercial homage to the\nwhale-ship, that cleared the way for the missionary and the merchant, and in\nmany cases carried the primitive missionaries to their first destinations. If\nthat double-bolted land, Japan, is ever to become hospitable, it is the\nwhale-ship alone to whom the credit will be due; for already she is on the\nthreshold.\n\nBut if, in the face of all this, you still declare that whaling has no\næsthetically noble associations connected with it, then am I ready to shiver\nfifty lances with you there, and unhorse you with a split helmet every time.\n\nThe whale has no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler, you will say.\n\nThe whale no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler? Who wrote the\nfirst account of our Leviathan? Who but mighty Job! And who composed the first\nnarrative of a whaling-voyage? Who, but no less a prince than Alfred the Great,\nwho, with his own royal pen, took down the words from Other, the Norwegian\nwhale-hunter of those times! And who pronounced our glowing eulogy in\nParliament? Who, but Edmund Burke!\n\nTrue enough, but then whalemen themselves are poor devils; they have no good\nblood in their veins.\n\nNo good blood in their veins? They have something better than royal blood there.\nThe grandmother of Benjamin Franklin was Mary Morrel; afterwards, by marriage,\nMary Folger, one of the old settlers of Nantucket, and the ancestress to a long\nline of Folgers and harpooneers—all kith and kin to noble Benjamin—this day\ndarting the barbed iron from one side of the world to the other.\n\nGood again; but then all confess that somehow whaling is not respectable.\n\nWhaling not respectable? Whaling is imperial! By old English statutory law, the\nwhale is declared “a royal fish.” *\n\nOh, that’s only nominal! The whale himself has never figured in any grand\nimposing way.\n\nThe whale never figured in any grand imposing way? In one of the mighty triumphs\ngiven to a Roman general upon his entering the world’s capital, the bones of a\nwhale, brought all the way from the Syrian coast, were the most conspicuous\nobject in the cymballed procession.*\n\n*See subsequent chapters for something more on this head.\n\nGrant it, since you cite it; but, say what you will, there is no real dignity in\nwhaling.\n\nNo dignity in whaling? The dignity of our calling the very heavens attest. Cetus\nis a constellation in the South! No more! Drive down your hat in presence of the\nCzar, and take it off to Queequeg! No more! I know a man that, in his lifetime,\nhas taken three hundred and fifty whales. I account that man more honorable than\nthat great captain of antiquity who boasted of taking as many walled towns.\n\nAnd, as for me, if, by any possibility, there be any as yet undiscovered prime\nthing in me; if I shall ever deserve any real repute in that small but high\nhushed world which I might not be unreasonably ambitious of; if hereafter I\nshall do anything that, upon the whole, a man might rather have done than to\nhave left undone; if, at my death, my executors, or more properly my creditors,\nfind any precious MSS. in my desk, then here I prospectively ascribe all the\nhonor and the glory to whaling; for a whale-ship was my Yale College and my\nHarvard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 25. POSTSCRIPT.\n\nIn behalf of the dignity of whaling, I would fain advance naught but\nsubstantiated facts. But after embattling his facts, an advocate who should\nwholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise, which might tell eloquently upon his\ncause—such an advocate, would he not be blameworthy?\n\nIt is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens, even modern ones, a\ncertain curious process of seasoning them for their functions is gone through.\nThere is a saltcellar of state, so called, and there may be a castor of state.\nHow they use the salt, precisely—who knows? Certain I am, however, that a king’s\nhead is solemnly oiled at his coronation, even as a head of salad. Can it be,\nthough, that they anoint it with a view of making its interior run well, as they\nanoint machinery? Much might be ruminated here, concerning the essential dignity\nof this regal process, because in common life we esteem but meanly and\ncontemptibly a fellow who anoints his hair, and palpably smells of that\nanointing. In truth, a mature man who uses hair-oil, unless medicinally, that\nman has probably got a quoggy spot in him somewhere. As a general rule, he can’t\namount to much in his totality.\n\nBut the only thing to be considered here, is this—what kind of oil is used at\ncoronations? Certainly it cannot be olive oil, nor macassar oil, nor castor oil,\nnor bear’s oil, nor train oil, nor cod-liver oil. What then can it possibly be,\nbut sperm oil in its unmanufactured, unpolluted state, the sweetest of all oils?\n\nThink of that, ye loyal Britons! we whalemen supply your kings and queens with\ncoronation stuff!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 26. KNIGHTS AND SQUIRES.\n\nThe chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket, and a Quaker\nby descent. He was a long, earnest man, and though born on an icy coast, seemed\nwell adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh being hard as twice-baked\nbiscuit. Transported to the Indies, his live blood would not spoil like bottled\nale. He must have been born in some time of general drought and famine, or upon\none of those fast days for which his state is famous. Only some thirty arid\nsummers had he seen; those summers had dried up all his physical\nsuperfluousness. But this, his thinness, so to speak, seemed no more the token\nof wasting anxieties and cares, than it seemed the indication of any bodily\nblight. It was merely the condensation of the man. He was by no means\nill-looking; quite the contrary. His pure tight skin was an excellent fit; and\nclosely wrapped up in it, and embalmed with inner health and strength, like a\nrevivified Egyptian, this Starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to\ncome, and to endure always, as now; for be it Polar snow or torrid sun, like a\npatent chronometer, his interior vitality was warranted to do well in all\nclimates. Looking into his eyes, you seemed to see there the yet lingering\nimages of those thousand-fold perils he had calmly confronted through life. A\nstaid, steadfast man, whose life for the most part was a telling pantomime of\naction, and not a tame chapter of sounds. Yet, for all his hardy sobriety and\nfortitude, there were certain qualities in him which at times affected, and in\nsome cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest. Uncommonly\nconscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep natural reverence, the wild\nwatery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline him to\nsuperstition; but to that sort of superstition, which in some organizations\nseems rather to spring, somehow, from intelligence than from ignorance. Outward\nportents and inward presentiments were his. And if at times these things bent\nthe welded iron of his soul, much more did his far-away domestic memories of his\nyoung Cape wife and child, tend to bend him still more from the original\nruggedness of his nature, and open him still further to those latent influences\nwhich, in some honest-hearted men, restrain the gush of dare-devil daring, so\noften evinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. “I\nwill have no man in my boat,” said Starbuck, “who is not afraid of a whale.” By\nthis, he seemed to mean, not only that the most reliable and useful courage was\nthat which arises from the fair estimation of the encountered peril, but that an\nutterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward.\n\n“Aye, aye,” said Stubb, the second mate, “Starbuck, there, is as careful a man\nas you’ll find anywhere in this fishery.” But we shall ere long see what that\nword “careful” precisely means when used by a man like Stubb, or almost any\nother whale hunter.\n\nStarbuck was no crusader after perils; in him courage was not a sentiment; but a\nthing simply useful to him, and always at hand upon all mortally practical\noccasions. Besides, he thought, perhaps, that in this business of whaling,\ncourage was one of the great staple outfits of the ship, like her beef and her\nbread, and not to be foolishly wasted. Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering\nfor whales after sun-down; nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much\npersisted in fighting him. For, thought Starbuck, I am here in this critical\nocean to kill whales for my living, and not to be killed by them for theirs; and\nthat hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck well knew. What doom was his\nown father’s? Where, in the bottomless deeps, could he find the torn limbs of\nhis brother?\n\nWith memories like these in him, and, moreover, given to a certain\nsuperstitiousness, as has been said; the courage of this Starbuck which could,\nnevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have been extreme. But it was not in\nreasonable nature that a man so organized, and with such terrible experiences\nand remembrances as he had; it was not in nature that these things should fail\nin latently engendering an element in him, which, under suitable circumstances,\nwould break out from its confinement, and burn all his courage up. And brave as\nhe might be, it was that sort of bravery chiefly, visible in some intrepid men,\nwhich, while generally abiding firm in the conflict with seas, or winds, or\nwhales, or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world, yet cannot\nwithstand those more terrific, because more spiritual terrors, which sometimes\nmenace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty man.\n\nBut were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance, the complete abasement\nof poor Starbuck’s fortitude, scarce might I have the heart to write it; for it\nis a thing most sorrowful, nay shocking, to expose the fall of valour in the\nsoul. Men may seem detestable as joint stock-companies and nations; knaves,\nfools, and murderers there may be; men may have mean and meagre faces; but man,\nin the ideal, is so noble and so sparkling, such a grand and glowing creature,\nthat over any ignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw\ntheir costliest robes. That immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves, so\nfar within us, that it remains intact though all the outer character seem gone;\nbleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a valor-ruined man. Nor\ncan piety itself, at such a shameful sight, completely stifle her upbraidings\nagainst the permitting stars. But this august dignity I treat of, is not the\ndignity of kings and robes, but that abounding dignity which has no robed\ninvestiture. Thou shalt see it shining in the arm that wields a pick or drives a\nspike; that democratic dignity which, on all hands, radiates without end from\nGod; Himself! The great God absolute! The centre and circumference of all\ndemocracy! His omnipresence, our divine equality!\n\nIf, then, to meanest mariners, and renegades and castaways, I shall hereafter\nascribe high qualities, though dark; weave round them tragic graces; if even the\nmost mournful, perchance the most abased, among them all, shall at times lift\nhimself to the exalted mounts; if I shall touch that workman’s arm with some\nethereal light; if I shall spread a rainbow over his disastrous set of sun; then\nagainst all mortal critics bear me out in it, thou just Spirit of Equality,\nwhich hast spread one royal mantle of humanity over all my kind! Bear me out in\nit, thou great democratic God! who didst not refuse to the swart convict,\nBunyan, the pale, poetic pearl; Thou who didst clothe with doubly hammered\nleaves of finest gold, the stumped and paupered arm of old Cervantes; Thou who\ndidst pick up Andrew Jackson from the pebbles; who didst hurl him upon a\nwar-horse; who didst thunder him higher than a throne! Thou who, in all Thy\nmighty, earthly marchings, ever cullest Thy selectest champions from the kingly\ncommons; bear me out in it, O God!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 27. KNIGHTS AND SQUIRES.\n\nStubb was the second mate. He was a native of Cape Cod; and hence, according to\nlocal usage, was called a Cape-Cod-man. A happy-go-lucky; neither craven nor\nvaliant; taking perils as they came with an indifferent air; and while engaged\nin the most imminent crisis of the chase, toiling away, calm and collected as a\njourneyman joiner engaged for the year. Good-humored, easy, and careless, he\npresided over his whale-boat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner,\nand his crew all invited guests. He was as particular about the comfortable\narrangement of his part of the boat, as an old stage-driver is about the\nsnugness of his box. When close to the whale, in the very death-lock of the\nfight, he handled his unpitying lance coolly and off-handedly, as a whistling\ntinker his hammer. He would hum over his old rigadig tunes while flank and flank\nwith the most exasperated monster. Long usage had, for this Stubb, converted the\njaws of death into an easy chair. What he thought of death itself, there is no\ntelling. Whether he ever thought of it at all, might be a question; but, if he\never did chance to cast his mind that way after a comfortable dinner, no doubt,\nlike a good sailor, he took it to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble\naloft, and bestir themselves there, about something which he would find out when\nhe obeyed the order, and not sooner.\n\nWhat, perhaps, with other things, made Stubb such an easy-going, unfearing man,\nso cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a world full of grave\npedlars, all bowed to the ground with their packs; what helped to bring about\nthat almost impious good-humor of his; that thing must have been his pipe. For,\nlike his nose, his short, black little pipe was one of the regular features of\nhis face. You would almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk\nwithout his nose as without his pipe. He kept a whole row of pipes there ready\nloaded, stuck in a rack, within easy reach of his hand; and, whenever he turned\nin, he smoked them all out in succession, lighting one from the other to the end\nof the chapter; then loading them again to be in readiness anew. For, when Stubb\ndressed, instead of first putting his legs into his trowsers, he put his pipe\ninto his mouth.\n\nI say this continual smoking must have been one cause, at least, of his peculiar\ndisposition; for every one knows that this earthly air, whether ashore or\nafloat, is terribly infected with the nameless miseries of the numberless\nmortals who have died exhaling it; and as in time of the cholera, some people go\nabout with a camphorated handkerchief to their mouths; so, likewise, against all\nmortal tribulations, Stubb’s tobacco smoke might have operated as a sort of\ndisinfecting agent.\n\nThe third mate was Flask, a native of Tisbury, in Martha’s Vineyard. A short,\nstout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious concerning whales, who somehow seemed\nto think that the great leviathans had personally and hereditarily affronted\nhim; and therefore it was a sort of point of honor with him, to destroy them\nwhenever encountered. So utterly lost was he to all sense of reverence for the\nmany marvels of their majestic bulk and mystic ways; and so dead to anything\nlike an apprehension of any possible danger from encountering them; that in his\npoor opinion, the wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse, or at\nleast water-rat, requiring only a little circumvention and some small\napplication of time and trouble in order to kill and boil. This ignorant,\nunconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in the matter of\nwhales; he followed these fish for the fun of it; and a three years’ voyage\nround Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length of time. As a\ncarpenter’s nails are divided into wrought nails and cut nails; so mankind may\nbe similarly divided. Little Flask was one of the wrought ones; made to clinch\ntight and last long. They called him King-Post on board of the Pequod; because,\nin form, he could be well likened to the short, square timber known by that name\nin Arctic whalers; and which by the means of many radiating side timbers\ninserted into it, serves to brace the ship against the icy concussions of those\nbattering seas.\n\nNow these three mates—Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, were momentous men. They it\nwas who by universal prescription commanded three of the Pequod’s boats as\nheadsmen. In that grand order of battle in which Captain Ahab would probably\nmarshal his forces to descend on the whales, these three headsmen were as\ncaptains of companies. Or, being armed with their long keen whaling spears, they\nwere as a picked trio of lancers; even as the harpooneers were flingers of\njavelins.\n\nAnd since in this famous fishery, each mate or headsman, like a Gothic Knight of\nold, is always accompanied by his boat-steerer or harpooneer, who in certain\nconjunctures provides him with a fresh lance, when the former one has been badly\ntwisted, or elbowed in the assault; and moreover, as there generally subsists\nbetween the two, a close intimacy and friendliness; it is therefore but meet,\nthat in this place we set down who the Pequod’s harpooneers were, and to what\nheadsman each of them belonged.\n\nFirst of all was Queequeg, whom Starbuck, the chief mate, had selected for his\nsquire. But Queequeg is already known.\n\nNext was Tashtego, an unmixed Indian from Gay Head, the most westerly promontory\nof Martha’s Vineyard, where there still exists the last remnant of a village of\nred men, which has long supplied the neighboring island of Nantucket with many\nof her most daring harpooneers. In the fishery, they usually go by the generic\nname of Gay-Headers. Tashtego’s long, lean, sable hair, his high cheek bones,\nand black rounding eyes—for an Indian, Oriental in their largeness, but\nAntarctic in their glittering expression—all this sufficiently proclaimed him an\ninheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proud warrior hunters, who, in quest\nof the great New England moose, had scoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal forests\nof the main. But no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the\nwoodland, Tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea; the\nunerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of the sires.\nTo look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs, you would almost have\ncredited the superstitions of some of the earlier Puritans, and half-believed\nthis wild Indian to be a son of the Prince of the Powers of the Air. Tashtego\nwas Stubb the second mate’s squire.\n\nThird among the harpooneers was Daggoo, a gigantic, coal-black negro-savage,\nwith a lion-like tread—an Ahasuerus to behold. Suspended from his ears were two\ngolden hoops, so large that the sailors called them ring-bolts, and would talk\nof securing the top-sail halyards to them. In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily\nshipped on board of a whaler, lying in a lonely bay on his native coast. And\nnever having been anywhere in the world but in Africa, Nantucket, and the pagan\nharbors most frequented by whalemen; and having now led for many years the bold\nlife of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what manner of\nmen they shipped; Daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues, and erect as a\ngiraffe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in his socks.\nThere was a corporeal humility in looking up at him; and a white man standing\nbefore him seemed a white flag come to beg truce of a fortress. Curious to tell,\nthis imperial negro, Ahasuerus Daggoo, was the Squire of little Flask, who\nlooked like a chess-man beside him. As for the residue of the Pequod’s company,\nbe it said, that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men\nbefore the mast employed in the American whale fishery, are Americans born,\nthough pretty nearly all the officers are. Herein it is the same with the\nAmerican whale fishery as with the American army and military and merchant\nnavies, and the engineering forces employed in the construction of the American\nCanals and Railroads. The same, I say, because in all these cases the native\nAmerican liberally provides the brains, the rest of the world as generously\nsupplying the muscles. No small number of these whaling seamen belong to the\nAzores, where the outward bound Nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment\ntheir crews from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores. In like manner, the\nGreenland whalers sailing out of Hull or London, put in at the Shetland Islands,\nto receive the full complement of their crew. Upon the passage homewards, they\ndrop them there again. How it is, there is no telling, but Islanders seem to\nmake the best whalemen. They were nearly all Islanders in the Pequod, Isolatoes\ntoo, I call such, not acknowledging the common continent of men, but each\nIsolato living on a separate continent of his own. Yet now, federated along one\nkeel, what a set these Isolatoes were! An Anacharsis Clootz deputation from all\nthe isles of the sea, and all the ends of the earth, accompanying Old Ahab in\nthe Pequod to lay the world’s grievances before that bar from which not very\nmany of them ever come back. Black Little Pip—he never did—oh, no! he went\nbefore. Poor Alabama boy! On the grim Pequod’s forecastle, ye shall ere long see\nhim, beating his tambourine; prelusive of the eternal time, when sent for, to\nthe great quarter-deck on high, he was bid strike in with angels, and beat his\ntambourine in glory; called a coward here, hailed a hero there!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 28. AHAB.\n\nFor several days after leaving Nantucket, nothing above hatches was seen of\nCaptain Ahab. The mates regularly relieved each other at the watches, and for\naught that could be seen to the contrary, they seemed to be the only commanders\nof the ship; only they sometimes issued from the cabin with orders so sudden and\nperemptory, that after all it was plain they but commanded vicariously. Yes,\ntheir supreme lord and dictator was there, though hitherto unseen by any eyes\nnot permitted to penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin.\n\nEvery time I ascended to the deck from my watches below, I instantly gazed aft\nto mark if any strange face were visible; for my first vague disquietude\ntouching the unknown captain, now in the seclusion of the sea, became almost a\nperturbation. This was strangely heightened at times by the ragged Elijah’s\ndiabolical incoherences uninvitedly recurring to me, with a subtle energy I\ncould not have before conceived of. But poorly could I withstand them, much as\nin other moods I was almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that\noutlandish prophet of the wharves. But whatever it was of apprehensiveness or\nuneasiness—to call it so—which I felt, yet whenever I came to look about me in\nthe ship, it seemed against all warrantry to cherish such emotions. For though\nthe harpooneers, with the great body of the crew, were a far more barbaric,\nheathenish, and motley set than any of the tame merchant-ship companies which my\nprevious experiences had made me acquainted with, still I ascribed this—and\nrightly ascribed it—to the fierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild\nScandinavian vocation in which I had so abandonedly embarked. But it was\nespecially the aspect of the three chief officers of the ship, the mates, which\nwas most forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings, and induce\nconfidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage. Three better,\nmore likely sea-officers and men, each in his own different way, could not\nreadily be found, and they were every one of them Americans; a Nantucketer, a\nVineyarder, a Cape man. Now, it being Christmas when the ship shot from out her\nharbor, for a space we had biting Polar weather, though all the time running\naway from it to the southward; and by every degree and minute of latitude which\nwe sailed, gradually leaving that merciless winter, and all its intolerable\nweather behind us. It was one of those less lowering, but still grey and gloomy\nenough mornings of the transition, when with a fair wind the ship was rushing\nthrough the water with a vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity,\nthat as I mounted to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch, so soon as I\nlevelled my glance towards the taffrail, foreboding shivers ran over me. Reality\noutran apprehension; Captain Ahab stood upon his quarter-deck.\n\nThere seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of the recovery\nfrom any. He looked like a man cut away from the stake, when the fire has\noverrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them, or taking away one\nparticle from their compacted aged robustness. His whole high, broad form,\nseemed made of solid bronze, and shaped in an unalterable mould, like Cellini’s\ncast Perseus. Threading its way out from among his grey hairs, and continuing\nright down one side of his tawny scorched face and neck, till it disappeared in\nhis clothing, you saw a slender rod-like mark, lividly whitish. It resembled\nthat perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight, lofty trunk of a great\ntree, when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it, and without wrenching a\nsingle twig, peels and grooves out the bark from top to bottom, ere running off\ninto the soil, leaving the tree still greenly alive, but branded. Whether that\nmark was born with him, or whether it was the scar left by some desperate wound,\nno one could certainly say. By some tacit consent, throughout the voyage little\nor no allusion was made to it, especially by the mates. But once Tashtego’s\nsenior, an old Gay-Head Indian among the crew, superstitiously asserted that not\ntill he was full forty years old did Ahab become that way branded, and then it\ncame upon him, not in the fury of any mortal fray, but in an elemental strife at\nsea. Yet, this wild hint seemed inferentially negatived, by what a grey Manxman\ninsinuated, an old sepulchral man, who, having never before sailed out of\nNantucket, had never ere this laid eye upon wild Ahab. Nevertheless, the old\nsea-traditions, the immemorial credulities, popularly invested this old Manxman\nwith preternatural powers of discernment. So that no white sailor seriously\ncontradicted him when he said that if ever Captain Ahab should be tranquilly\nlaid out—which might hardly come to pass, so he muttered—then, whoever should do\nthat last office for the dead, would find a birth-mark on him from crown to\nsole.\n\nSo powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me, and the livid brand\nwhich streaked it, that for the first few moments I hardly noted that not a\nlittle of this overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric white leg upon\nwhich he partly stood. It had previously come to me that this ivory leg had at\nsea been fashioned from the polished bone of the sperm whale’s jaw. “Aye, he was\ndismasted off Japan,” said the old Gay-Head Indian once; “but like his dismasted\ncraft, he shipped another mast without coming home for it. He has a quiver of\n’em.”\n\nI was struck with the singular posture he maintained. Upon each side of the\nPequod’s quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds, there was an\nauger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the plank. His bone leg\nsteadied in that hole; one arm elevated, and holding by a shroud; Captain Ahab\nstood erect, looking straight out beyond the ship’s ever-pitching prow. There\nwas an infinity of firmest fortitude, a determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness,\nin the fixed and fearless, forward dedication of that glance. Not a word he\nspoke; nor did his officers say aught to him; though by all their minutest\ngestures and expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if not painful,\nconsciousness of being under a troubled master-eye. And not only that, but moody\nstricken Ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his face; in all the\nnameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe.\n\nEre long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his cabin. But after\nthat morning, he was every day visible to the crew; either standing in his\npivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he had; or heavily walking the deck.\nAs the sky grew less gloomy; indeed, began to grow a little genial, he became\nstill less and less a recluse; as if, when the ship had sailed from home,\nnothing but the dead wintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded.\nAnd, by and by, it came to pass, that he was almost continually in the air; but,\nas yet, for all that he said, or perceptibly did, on the at last sunny deck, he\nseemed as unnecessary there as another mast. But the Pequod was only making a\npassage now; not regularly cruising; nearly all whaling preparatives needing\nsupervision the mates were fully competent to, so that there was little or\nnothing, out of himself, to employ or excite Ahab, now; and thus chase away, for\nthat one interval, the clouds that layer upon layer were piled upon his brow, as\never all clouds choose the loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon.\n\nNevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the pleasant,\nholiday weather we came to, seemed gradually to charm him from his mood. For, as\nwhen the red-cheeked, dancing girls, April and May, trip home to the wintry,\nmisanthropic woods; even the barest, ruggedest, most thunder-cloven old oak will\nat least send forth some few green sprouts, to welcome such glad-hearted\nvisitants; so Ahab did, in the end, a little respond to the playful allurings of\nthat girlish air. More than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look,\nwhich, in any other man, would have soon flowered out in a smile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 29. ENTER AHAB; TO HIM, STUBB.\n\nSome days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the Pequod now went rolling\nthrough the bright Quito spring, which, at sea, almost perpetually reigns on the\nthreshold of the eternal August of the Tropic. The warmly cool, clear, ringing,\nperfumed, overflowing, redundant days, were as crystal goblets of Persian\nsherbet, heaped up—flaked up, with rose-water snow. The starred and stately\nnights seemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets, nursing at home in lonely\npride, the memory of their absent conquering Earls, the golden helmeted suns!\nFor sleeping man, ’twas hard to choose between such winsome days and such\nseducing nights. But all the witcheries of that unwaning weather did not merely\nlend new spells and potencies to the outward world. Inward they turned upon the\nsoul, especially when the still mild hours of eve came on; then, memory shot her\ncrystals as the clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights. And all these\nsubtle agencies, more and more they wrought on Ahab’s texture.\n\nOld age is always wakeful; as if, the longer linked with life, the less man has\nto do with aught that looks like death. Among sea-commanders, the old greybeards\nwill oftenest leave their berths to visit the night-cloaked deck. It was so with\nAhab; only that now, of late, he seemed so much to live in the open air, that\ntruly speaking, his visits were more to the cabin, than from the cabin to the\nplanks. “It feels like going down into one’s tomb,”—he would mutter to\nhimself—“for an old captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle, to go\nto my grave-dug berth.”\n\nSo, almost every twenty-four hours, when the watches of the night were set, and\nthe band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below; and when if a rope\nwas to be hauled upon the forecastle, the sailors flung it not rudely down, as\nby day, but with some cautiousness dropt it to its place for fear of disturbing\ntheir slumbering shipmates; when this sort of steady quietude would begin to\nprevail, habitually, the silent steersman would watch the cabin-scuttle; and ere\nlong the old man would emerge, gripping at the iron banister, to help his\ncrippled way. Some considering touch of humanity was in him; for at times like\nthese, he usually abstained from patrolling the quarter-deck; because to his\nwearied mates, seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel, such would\nhave been the reverberating crack and din of that bony step, that their dreams\nwould have been on the crunching teeth of sharks. But once, the mood was on him\ntoo deep for common regardings; and as with heavy, lumber-like pace he was\nmeasuring the ship from taffrail to mainmast, Stubb, the old second mate, came\nup from below, with a certain unassured, deprecating humorousness, hinted that\nif Captain Ahab was pleased to walk the planks, then, no one could say nay; but\nthere might be some way of muffling the noise; hinting something indistinctly\nand hesitatingly about a globe of tow, and the insertion into it, of the ivory\nheel. Ah! Stubb, thou didst not know Ahab then.\n\n“Am I a cannon-ball, Stubb,” said Ahab, “that thou wouldst wad me that fashion?\nBut go thy ways; I had forgot. Below to thy nightly grave; where such as ye\nsleep between shrouds, to use ye to the filling one at last.—Down, dog, and\nkennel!”\n\nStarting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly scornful old\nman, Stubb was speechless a moment; then said excitedly, “I am not used to be\nspoken to that way, sir; I do but less than half like it, sir.”\n\n“Avast! gritted Ahab between his set teeth, and violently moving away, as if to\navoid some passionate temptation.\n\n“No, sir; not yet,” said Stubb, emboldened, “I will not tamely be called a dog,\nsir.”\n\n“Then be called ten times a donkey, and a mule, and an ass, and begone, or I’ll\nclear the world of thee!”\n\nAs he said this, Ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors in his\naspect, that Stubb involuntarily retreated.\n\n“I was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it,” muttered\nStubb, as he found himself descending the cabin-scuttle. “It’s very queer. Stop,\nStubb; somehow, now, I don’t well know whether to go back and strike him,\nor—what’s that?—down here on my knees and pray for him? Yes, that was the\nthought coming up in me; but it would be the first time I ever did pray. It’s\nqueer; very queer; and he’s queer too; aye, take him fore and aft, he’s about\nthe queerest old man Stubb ever sailed with. How he flashed at me!—his eyes like\npowder-pans! is he mad? Anyway there’s something on his mind, as sure as there\nmust be something on a deck when it cracks. He aint in his bed now, either, more\nthan three hours out of the twenty-four; and he don’t sleep then. Didn’t that\nDough-Boy, the steward, tell me that of a morning he always finds the old man’s\nhammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled, and the sheets down at the foot, and\nthe coverlid almost tied into knots, and the pillow a sort of frightful hot, as\nthough a baked brick had been on it? A hot old man! I guess he’s got what some\nfolks ashore call a conscience; it’s a kind of Tic-Dolly-row they say—worse nor\na toothache. Well, well; I don’t know what it is, but the Lord keep me from\ncatching it. He’s full of riddles; I wonder what he goes into the after hold\nfor, every night, as Dough-Boy tells me he suspects; what’s that for, I should\nlike to know? Who’s made appointments with him in the hold? Ain’t that queer,\nnow? But there’s no telling, it’s the old game—Here goes for a snooze. Damn me,\nit’s worth a fellow’s while to be born into the world, if only to fall right\nasleep. And now that I think of it, that’s about the first thing babies do, and\nthat’s a sort of queer, too. Damn me, but all things are queer, come to think of\n’em. But that’s against my principles. Think not, is my eleventh commandment;\nand sleep when you can, is my twelfth—So here goes again. But how’s that? didn’t\nhe call me a dog? blazes! he called me ten times a donkey, and piled a lot of\njackasses on top of that! He might as well have kicked me, and done with it.\nMaybe he did kick me, and I didn’t observe it, I was so taken all aback with his\nbrow, somehow. It flashed like a bleached bone. What the devil’s the matter with\nme? I don’t stand right on my legs. Coming afoul of that old man has a sort of\nturned me wrong side out. By the Lord, I must have been dreaming, though—How?\nhow? how?—but the only way’s to stash it; so here goes to hammock again; and in\nthe morning, I’ll see how this plaguey juggling thinks over by daylight.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 30. THE PIPE.\n\nWhen Stubb had departed, Ahab stood for a while leaning over the bulwarks; and\nthen, as had been usual with him of late, calling a sailor of the watch, he sent\nhim below for his ivory stool, and also his pipe. Lighting the pipe at the\nbinnacle lamp and planting the stool on the weather side of the deck, he sat and\nsmoked.\n\nIn old Norse times, the thrones of the sea-loving Danish kings were fabricated,\nsaith tradition, of the tusks of the narwhale. How could one look at Ahab then,\nseated on that tripod of bones, without bethinking him of the royalty it\nsymbolized? For a Khan of the plank, and a king of the sea, and a great lord of\nLeviathans was Ahab.\n\nSome moments passed, during which the thick vapor came from his mouth in quick\nand constant puffs, which blew back again into his face. “How now,” he\nsoliloquized at last, withdrawing the tube, “this smoking no longer soothes. Oh,\nmy pipe! hard must it go with me if thy charm be gone! Here have I been\nunconsciously toiling, not pleasuring—aye, and ignorantly smoking to windward\nall the while; to windward, and with such nervous whiffs, as if, like the dying\nwhale, my final jets were the strongest and fullest of trouble. What business\nhave I with this pipe? This thing that is meant for sereneness, to send up mild\nwhite vapors among mild white hairs, not among torn iron-grey locks like mine.\nI’ll smoke no more—”\n\nHe tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea. The fire hissed in the waves; the\nsame instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe made. With slouched\nhat, Ahab lurchingly paced the planks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 31. QUEEN MAB.\n\nNext morning Stubb accosted Flask.\n\n“Such a queer dream, King-Post, I never had. You know the old man’s ivory leg,\nwell I dreamed he kicked me with it; and when I tried to kick back, upon my\nsoul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off! And then, presto! Ahab seemed a\npyramid, and I, like a blazing fool, kept kicking at it. But what was still more\ncurious, Flask—you know how curious all dreams are—through all this rage that I\nwas in, I somehow seemed to be thinking to myself, that after all, it was not\nmuch of an insult, that kick from Ahab. ‘Why,’ thinks I, ‘what’s the row? It’s\nnot a real leg, only a false leg.’ And there’s a mighty difference between a\nliving thump and a dead thump. That’s what makes a blow from the hand, Flask,\nfifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane. The living member—that\nmakes the living insult, my little man. And thinks I to myself all the while,\nmind, while I was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed pyramid—so\nconfoundedly contradictory was it all, all the while, I say, I was thinking to\nmyself, ‘what’s his leg now, but a cane—a whalebone cane. Yes,’ thinks I, ‘it\nwas only a playful cudgelling—in fact, only a whaleboning that he gave me—not a\nbase kick. Besides,’ thinks I, ‘look at it once; why, the end of it—the foot\npart—what a small sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad footed farmer kicked\nme, there’s a devilish broad insult. But this insult is whittled down to a point\nonly.’ But now comes the greatest joke of the dream, Flask. While I was\nbattering away at the pyramid, a sort of badger-haired old merman, with a hump\non his back, takes me by the shoulders, and slews me round. ‘What are you\n’bout?’ says he. Slid! man, but I was frightened. Such a phiz! But, somehow,\nnext moment I was over the fright. ‘What am I about?’ says I at last. ‘And what\nbusiness is that of yours, I should like to know, Mr. Humpback? Do you want a\nkick?’ By the lord, Flask, I had no sooner said that, than he turned round his\nstern to me, bent over, and dragging up a lot of seaweed he had for a clout—what\ndo you think, I saw?—why thunder alive, man, his stern was stuck full of\nmarlinspikes, with the points out. Says I, on second thoughts, ‘I guess I won’t\nkick you, old fellow.’ ‘Wise Stubb,’ said he, ‘wise Stubb;’ and kept muttering\nit all the time, a sort of eating of his own gums like a chimney hag. Seeing he\nwasn’t going to stop saying over his ‘wise Stubb, wise Stubb,’ I thought I might\nas well fall to kicking the pyramid again. But I had only just lifted my foot\nfor it, when he roared out, ‘Stop that kicking!’ ‘Halloa,’ says I, ‘what’s the\nmatter now, old fellow?’ ‘Look ye here,’ says he; ‘let’s argue the insult.\nCaptain Ahab kicked ye, didn’t he?’ ‘Yes, he did,’ says I—‘right here it was.’\n‘Very good,’ says he—‘he used his ivory leg, didn’t he?’ ‘Yes, he did,’ says I.\n‘Well then,’ says he, ‘wise Stubb, what have you to complain of? Didn’t he kick\nwith right good will? it wasn’t a common pitch pine leg he kicked with, was it?\nNo, you were kicked by a great man, and with a beautiful ivory leg, Stubb. It’s\nan honor; I consider it an honor. Listen, wise Stubb. In old England the\ngreatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen, and made\ngarter-knights of; but, be your boast, Stubb, that ye were kicked by old Ahab,\nand made a wise man of. Remember what I say; be kicked by him; account his kicks\nhonors; and on no account kick back; for you can’t help yourself, wise Stubb.\nDon’t you see that pyramid?’ With that, he all of a sudden seemed somehow, in\nsome queer fashion, to swim off into the air. I snored; rolled over; and there I\nwas in my hammock! Now, what do you think of that dream, Flask?”\n\n“I don’t know; it seems a sort of foolish to me, tho.’”\n\n“May be; may be. But it’s made a wise man of me, Flask. D’ye see Ahab standing\nthere, sideways looking over the stern? Well, the best thing you can do, Flask,\nis to let the old man alone; never speak to him, whatever he says. Halloa!\nWhat’s that he shouts? Hark!”\n\n“Mast-head, there! Look sharp, all of ye! There are whales hereabouts!\n\n“If ye see a white one, split your lungs for him!\n\n“What do you think of that now, Flask? ain’t there a small drop of something\nqueer about that, eh? A white whale—did ye mark that, man? Look ye—there’s\nsomething special in the wind. Stand by for it, Flask. Ahab has that that’s\nbloody on his mind. But, mum; he comes this way.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 32. CETOLOGY.\n\nAlready we are boldly launched upon the deep; but soon we shall be lost in its\nunshored, harbourless immensities. Ere that come to pass; ere the Pequod’s weedy\nhull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls of the leviathan; at the outset\nit is but well to attend to a matter almost indispensable to a thorough\nappreciative understanding of the more special leviathanic revelations and\nallusions of all sorts which are to follow.\n\nIt is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera, that I\nwould now fain put before you. Yet is it no easy task. The classification of the\nconstituents of a chaos, nothing less is here essayed. Listen to what the best\nand latest authorities have laid down.\n\n“No branch of Zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled Cetology,”\nsays Captain Scoresby, A.D. 1820.\n\n“It is not my intention, were it in my power, to enter into the inquiry as to\nthe true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and families. * * * Utter\nconfusion exists among the historians of this animal” (sperm whale), says\nSurgeon Beale, A.D. 1839.\n\n“Unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters.” “Impenetrable\nveil covering our knowledge of the cetacea.” “A field strewn with thorns.” “All\nthese incomplete indications but serve to torture us naturalists.”\n\nThus speak of the whale, the great Cuvier, and John Hunter, and Lesson, those\nlights of zoology and anatomy. Nevertheless, though of real knowledge there be\nlittle, yet of books there are a plenty; and so in some small degree, with\ncetology, or the science of whales. Many are the men, small and great, old and\nnew, landsmen and seamen, who have at large or in little, written of the whale.\nRun over a few:—The Authors of the Bible; Aristotle; Pliny; Aldrovandi; Sir\nThomas Browne; Gesner; Ray; Linnæus; Rondeletius; Willoughby; Green; Artedi;\nSibbald; Brisson; Marten; Lacépède; Bonneterre; Desmarest; Baron Cuvier;\nFrederick Cuvier; John Hunter; Owen; Scoresby; Beale; Bennett; J. Ross Browne;\nthe Author of Miriam Coffin; Olmstead; and the Rev. T. Cheever. But to what\nultimate generalizing purpose all these have written, the above cited extracts\nwill show.\n\nOf the names in this list of whale authors, only those following Owen ever saw\nliving whales; and but one of them was a real professional harpooneer and\nwhaleman. I mean Captain Scoresby. On the separate subject of the Greenland or\nright-whale, he is the best existing authority. But Scoresby knew nothing and\nsays nothing of the great sperm whale, compared with which the Greenland whale\nis almost unworthy mentioning. And here be it said, that the Greenland whale is\nan usurper upon the throne of the seas. He is not even by any means the largest\nof the whales. Yet, owing to the long priority of his claims, and the profound\nignorance which, till some seventy years back, invested the then fabulous or\nutterly unknown sperm-whale, and which ignorance to this present day still\nreigns in all but some few scientific retreats and whale-ports; this usurpation\nhas been every way complete. Reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions\nin the great poets of past days, will satisfy you that the Greenland whale,\nwithout one rival, was to them the monarch of the seas. But the time has at last\ncome for a new proclamation. This is Charing Cross; hear ye! good people\nall,—the Greenland whale is deposed,—the great sperm whale now reigneth!\n\nThere are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living sperm\nwhale before you, and at the same time, in the remotest degree succeed in the\nattempt. Those books are Beale’s and Bennett’s; both in their time surgeons to\nEnglish South-Sea whale-ships, and both exact and reliable men. The original\nmatter touching the sperm whale to be found in their volumes is necessarily\nsmall; but so far as it goes, it is of excellent quality, though mostly confined\nto scientific description. As yet, however, the sperm whale, scientific or\npoetic, lives not complete in any literature. Far above all other hunted whales,\nhis is an unwritten life.\n\nNow the various species of whales need some sort of popular comprehensive\nclassification, if only an easy outline one for the present, hereafter to be\nfilled in all its departments by subsequent laborers. As no better man advances\nto take this matter in hand, I hereupon offer my own poor endeavors. I promise\nnothing complete; because any human thing supposed to be complete, must for that\nvery reason infallibly be faulty. I shall not pretend to a minute anatomical\ndescription of the various species, or—in this place at least—to much of any\ndescription. My object here is simply to project the draught of a\nsystematization of cetology. I am the architect, not the builder.\n\nBut it is a ponderous task; no ordinary letter-sorter in the Post-Office is\nequal to it. To grope down into the bottom of the sea after them; to have one’s\nhands among the unspeakable foundations, ribs, and very pelvis of the world;\nthis is a fearful thing. What am I that I should essay to hook the nose of this\nleviathan! The awful tauntings in Job might well appal me. Will he (the\nleviathan) make a covenant with thee? Behold the hope of him is vain! But I have\nswam through libraries and sailed through oceans; I have had to do with whales\nwith these visible hands; I am in earnest; and I will try. There are some\npreliminaries to settle.\n\nFirst: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology is in the\nvery vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters it still remains a\nmoot point whether a whale be a fish. In his System of Nature, A.D. 1776,\nLinnæus declares, “I hereby separate the whales from the fish.” But of my own\nknowledge, I know that down to the year 1850, sharks and shad, alewives and\nherring, against Linnæus’s express edict, were still found dividing the\npossession of the same seas with the Leviathan.\n\nThe grounds upon which Linnæus would fain have banished the whales from the\nwaters, he states as follows: “On account of their warm bilocular heart, their\nlungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow ears, penem intrantem feminam mammis\nlactantem,” and finally, “ex lege naturæ jure meritoque.” I submitted all this\nto my friends Simeon Macey and Charley Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of\nmine in a certain voyage, and they united in the opinion that the reasons set\nforth were altogether insufficient. Charley profanely hinted they were humbug.\n\nBe it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned ground\nthat the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me. This fundamental\nthing settled, the next point is, in what internal respect does the whale differ\nfrom other fish. Above, Linnæus has given you those items. But in brief, they\nare these: lungs and warm blood; whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold\nblooded.\n\nNext: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as\nconspicuously to label him for all time to come? To be short, then, a whale is a\nspouting fish with a horizontal tail. There you have him. However contracted,\nthat definition is the result of expanded meditation. A walrus spouts much like\na whale, but the walrus is not a fish, because he is amphibious. But the last\nterm of the definition is still more cogent, as coupled with the first. Almost\nany one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a\nflat, but a vertical, or up-and-down tail. Whereas, among spouting fish the\ntail, though it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal\nposition.\n\nBy the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude from the\nleviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with the whale by\nthe best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other hand, link with it any fish\nhitherto authoritatively regarded as alien.* Hence, all the smaller, spouting,\nand horizontal tailed fish must be included in this ground-plan of Cetology.\nNow, then, come the grand divisions of the entire whale host.\n\n*I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamatins and Dugongs\n(Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) are included by many\nnaturalists among the whales. But as these pig-fish are a noisy, contemptible\nset, mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers, and feeding on wet hay, and\nespecially as they do not spout, I deny their credentials as whales; and have\npresented them with their passports to quit the Kingdom of Cetology.\n\nFirst: According to magnitude I divide the whales into three primary BOOKS\n(subdivisible into CHAPTERS), and these shall comprehend them all, both small\nand large.\n\nI. THE FOLIO WHALE; II. the OCTAVO WHALE; III. the DUODECIMO WHALE.\n\nAs the type of the FOLIO I present the Sperm Whale; of the OCTAVO, the Grampus;\nof the DUODECIMO, the Porpoise.\n\nFOLIOS. Among these I here include the following chapters:—I. The Sperm Whale;\nII. the Right Whale; III. the Fin-Back Whale; IV. the Hump-backed Whale; V. the\nRazor Back Whale; VI. the Sulphur Bottom Whale.\n\nBOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER I. (Sperm Whale).—This whale, among the English of old\nvaguely known as the Trumpa whale, and the Physeter whale, and the Anvil Headed\nwhale, is the present Cachalot of the French, and the Pottsfich of the Germans,\nand the Macrocephalus of the Long Words. He is, without doubt, the largest\ninhabitant of the globe; the most formidable of all whales to encounter; the\nmost majestic in aspect; and lastly, by far the most valuable in commerce; he\nbeing the only creature from which that valuable substance, spermaceti, is\nobtained. All his peculiarities will, in many other places, be enlarged upon. It\nis chiefly with his name that I now have to do. Philologically considered, it is\nabsurd. Some centuries ago, when the Sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in\nhis own proper individuality, and when his oil was only accidentally obtained\nfrom the stranded fish; in those days spermaceti, it would seem, was popularly\nsupposed to be derived from a creature identical with the one then known in\nEngland as the Greenland or Right Whale. It was the idea also, that this same\nspermaceti was that quickening humor of the Greenland Whale which the first\nsyllable of the word literally expresses. In those times, also, spermaceti was\nexceedingly scarce, not being used for light, but only as an ointment and\nmedicament. It was only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays buy an\nounce of rhubarb. When, as I opine, in the course of time, the true nature of\nspermaceti became known, its original name was still retained by the dealers; no\ndoubt to enhance its value by a notion so strangely significant of its scarcity.\nAnd so the appellation must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from\nwhich this spermaceti was really derived.\n\nBOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER II. (Right Whale).—In one respect this is the most\nvenerable of the leviathans, being the one first regularly hunted by man. It\nyields the article commonly known as whalebone or baleen; and the oil specially\nknown as “whale oil,” an inferior article in commerce. Among the fishermen, he\nis indiscriminately designated by all the following titles: The Whale; the\nGreenland Whale; the Black Whale; the Great Whale; the True Whale; the Right\nWhale. There is a deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus\nmultitudinously baptised. What then is the whale, which I include in the second\nspecies of my Folios? It is the Great Mysticetus of the English naturalists; the\nGreenland Whale of the English whalemen; the Baleine Ordinaire of the French\nwhalemen; the Growlands Walfish of the Swedes. It is the whale which for more\nthan two centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and English in the Arctic\nseas; it is the whale which the American fishermen have long pursued in the\nIndian ocean, on the Brazil Banks, on the Nor’ West Coast, and various other\nparts of the world, designated by them Right Whale Cruising Grounds.\n\nSome pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the English and\nthe right whale of the Americans. But they precisely agree in all their grand\nfeatures; nor has there yet been presented a single determinate fact upon which\nto ground a radical distinction. It is by endless subdivisions based upon the\nmost inconclusive differences, that some departments of natural history become\nso repellingly intricate. The right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some\nlength, with reference to elucidating the sperm whale.\n\nBOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER III. (Fin-Back).—Under this head I reckon a monster\nwhich, by the various names of Fin-Back, Tall-Spout, and Long-John, has been\nseen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale whose distant jet is so often\ndescried by passengers crossing the Atlantic, in the New York packet-tracks. In\nthe length he attains, and in his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the right\nwhale, but is of a less portly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to\nolive. His great lips present a cable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting,\nslanting folds of large wrinkles. His grand distinguishing feature, the fin,\nfrom which he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object. This fin is some\nthree or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder part of the back, of\nan angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed end. Even if not the slightest\nother part of the creature be visible, this isolated fin will, at times, be seen\nplainly projecting from the surface. When the sea is moderately calm, and\nslightly marked with spherical ripples, and this gnomon-like fin stands up and\ncasts shadows upon the wrinkled surface, it may well be supposed that the watery\ncircle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial, with its style and wavy\nhour-lines graved on it. On that Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes back. The\nFin-Back is not gregarious. He seems a whale-hater, as some men are man-haters.\nVery shy; always going solitary; unexpectedly rising to the surface in the\nremotest and most sullen waters; his straight and single lofty jet rising like a\ntall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous power and\nvelocity in swimming, as to defy all present pursuit from man; this leviathan\nseems the banished and unconquerable Cain of his race, bearing for his mark that\nstyle upon his back. From having the baleen in his mouth, the Fin-Back is\nsometimes included with the right whale, among a theoretic species denominated\nWhalebone whales, that is, whales with baleen. Of these so called Whalebone\nwhales, there would seem to be several varieties, most of which, however, are\nlittle known. Broad-nosed whales and beaked whales; pike-headed whales; bunched\nwhales; under-jawed whales and rostrated whales, are the fishermen’s names for a\nfew sorts.\n\nIn connection with this appellative of “Whalebone whales,” it is of great\nimportance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be convenient in\nfacilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it is in vain to attempt a\nclear classification of the Leviathan, founded upon either his baleen, or hump,\nor fin, or teeth; notwithstanding that those marked parts or features very\nobviously seem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular system of\nCetology than any other detached bodily distinctions, which the whale, in his\nkinds, presents. How then? The baleen, hump, back-fin, and teeth; these are\nthings whose peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of\nwhales, without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other\nand more essential particulars. Thus, the sperm whale and the humpbacked whale,\neach has a hump; but there the similitude ceases. Then, this same humpbacked\nwhale and the Greenland whale, each of these has baleen; but there again the\nsimilitude ceases. And it is just the same with the other parts above mentioned.\nIn various sorts of whales, they form such irregular combinations; or, in the\ncase of any one of them detached, such an irregular isolation; as utterly to\ndefy all general methodization formed upon such a basis. On this rock every one\nof the whale-naturalists has split.\n\nBut it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts of the whale, in\nhis anatomy—there, at least, we shall be able to hit the right classification.\nNay; what thing, for example, is there in the Greenland whale’s anatomy more\nstriking than his baleen? Yet we have seen that by his baleen it is impossible\ncorrectly to classify the Greenland whale. And if you descend into the bowels of\nthe various leviathans, why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part\nas available to the systematizer as those external ones already enumerated. What\nthen remains? nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily, in their entire\nliberal volume, and boldly sort them that way. And this is the Bibliographical\nsystem here adopted; and it is the only one that can possibly succeed, for it\nalone is practicable. To proceed.\n\nBOOK I. (Folio) CHAPTER IV. (Hump Back).—This whale is often seen on the\nnorthern American coast. He has been frequently captured there, and towed into\nharbor. He has a great pack on him like a peddler; or you might call him the\nElephant and Castle whale. At any rate, the popular name for him does not\nsufficiently distinguish him, since the sperm whale also has a hump though a\nsmaller one. His oil is not very valuable. He has baleen. He is the most\ngamesome and light-hearted of all the whales, making more gay foam and white\nwater generally than any other of them.\n\nBOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER V. (Razor Back).—Of this whale little is known but his\nname. I have seen him at a distance off Cape Horn. Of a retiring nature, he\neludes both hunters and philosophers. Though no coward, he has never yet shown\nany part of him but his back, which rises in a long sharp ridge. Let him go. I\nknow little more of him, nor does anybody else.\n\nBOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER VI. (Sulphur Bottom).—Another retiring gentleman, with\na brimstone belly, doubtless got by scraping along the Tartarian tiles in some\nof his profounder divings. He is seldom seen; at least I have never seen him\nexcept in the remoter southern seas, and then always at too great a distance to\nstudy his countenance. He is never chased; he would run away with rope-walks of\nline. Prodigies are told of him. Adieu, Sulphur Bottom! I can say nothing more\nthat is true of ye, nor can the oldest Nantucketer.\n\nThus ends BOOK I. (Folio), and now begins BOOK II. (Octavo).\n\nOCTAVOES.*—These embrace the whales of middling magnitude, among which present\nmay be numbered:—I., the Grampus; II., the Black Fish; III., the Narwhale; IV.,\nthe Thrasher; V., the Killer.\n\n*Why this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain. Because,\nwhile the whales of this order, though smaller than those of the former order,\nnevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them in figure, yet the\nbookbinder’s Quarto volume in its dimensioned form does not preserve the shape\nof the Folio volume, but the Octavo volume does.\n\nBOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER I. (Grampus).—Though this fish, whose loud sonorous\nbreathing, or rather blowing, has furnished a proverb to landsmen, is so well\nknown a denizen of the deep, yet is he not popularly classed among whales. But\npossessing all the grand distinctive features of the leviathan, most naturalists\nhave recognised him for one. He is of moderate octavo size, varying from fifteen\nto twenty-five feet in length, and of corresponding dimensions round the waist.\nHe swims in herds; he is never regularly hunted, though his oil is considerable\nin quantity, and pretty good for light. By some fishermen his approach is\nregarded as premonitory of the advance of the great sperm whale.\n\nBOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER II. (Black Fish).—I give the popular fishermen’s\nnames for all these fish, for generally they are the best. Where any name\nhappens to be vague or inexpressive, I shall say so, and suggest another. I do\nso now, touching the Black Fish, so-called, because blackness is the rule among\nalmost all whales. So, call him the Hyena Whale, if you please. His voracity is\nwell known, and from the circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are\ncurved upwards, he carries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his face. This\nwhale averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length. He is found in almost\nall latitudes. He has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin in\nswimming, which looks something like a Roman nose. When not more profitably\nemployed, the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the Hyena whale, to keep up\nthe supply of cheap oil for domestic employment—as some frugal housekeepers, in\nthe absence of company, and quite alone by themselves, burn unsavory tallow\ninstead of odorous wax. Though their blubber is very thin, some of these whales\nwill yield you upwards of thirty gallons of oil.\n\nBOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER III. (Narwhale), that is, Nostril whale.—Another\ninstance of a curiously named whale, so named I suppose from his peculiar horn\nbeing originally mistaken for a peaked nose. The creature is some sixteen feet\nin length, while its horn averages five feet, though some exceed ten, and even\nattain to fifteen feet. Strictly speaking, this horn is but a lengthened tusk,\ngrowing out from the jaw in a line a little depressed from the horizontal. But\nit is only found on the sinister side, which has an ill effect, giving its owner\nsomething analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left-handed man. What precise\npurpose this ivory horn or lance answers, it would be hard to say. It does not\nseem to be used like the blade of the sword-fish and bill-fish; though some\nsailors tell me that the Narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the\nbottom of the sea for food. Charley Coffin said it was used for an ice-piercer;\nfor the Narwhale, rising to the surface of the Polar Sea, and finding it sheeted\nwith ice, thrusts his horn up, and so breaks through. But you cannot prove\neither of these surmises to be correct. My own opinion is, that however this\none-sided horn may really be used by the Narwhale—however that may be—it would\ncertainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets. The\nNarwhale I have heard called the Tusked whale, the Horned whale, and the Unicorn\nwhale. He is certainly a curious example of the Unicornism to be found in almost\nevery kingdom of animated nature. From certain cloistered old authors I have\ngathered that this same sea-unicorn’s horn was in ancient days regarded as the\ngreat antidote against poison, and as such, preparations of it brought immense\nprices. It was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies, the same\nway that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn. Originally\nit was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity. Black Letter tells me\nthat Sir Martin Frobisher on his return from that voyage, when Queen Bess did\ngallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window of Greenwich Palace, as\nhis bold ship sailed down the Thames; “when Sir Martin returned from that\nvoyage,” saith Black Letter, “on bended knees he presented to her highness a\nprodigious long horn of the Narwhale, which for a long period after hung in the\ncastle at Windsor.” An Irish author avers that the Earl of Leicester, on bended\nknees, did likewise present to her highness another horn, pertaining to a land\nbeast of the unicorn nature.\n\nThe Narwhale has a very picturesque, leopard-like look, being of a milk-white\nground colour, dotted with round and oblong spots of black. His oil is very\nsuperior, clear and fine; but there is little of it, and he is seldom hunted. He\nis mostly found in the circumpolar seas.\n\nBOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER IV. (Killer).—Of this whale little is precisely known\nto the Nantucketer, and nothing at all to the professed naturalist. From what I\nhave seen of him at a distance, I should say that he was about the bigness of a\ngrampus. He is very savage—a sort of Feegee fish. He sometimes takes the great\nFolio whales by the lip, and hangs there like a leech, till the mighty brute is\nworried to death. The Killer is never hunted. I never heard what sort of oil he\nhas. Exception might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale, on the\nground of its indistinctness. For we are all killers, on land and on sea;\nBonapartes and Sharks included.\n\nBOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER V. (Thrasher).—This gentleman is famous for his tail,\nwhich he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes. He mounts the Folio whale’s\nback, and as he swims, he works his passage by flogging him; as some\nschoolmasters get along in the world by a similar process. Still less is known\nof the Thrasher than of the Killer. Both are outlaws, even in the lawless seas.\n\nThus ends BOOK II. (Octavo), and begins BOOK III. (Duodecimo).\n\nDUODECIMOES.—These include the smaller whales. I. The Huzza Porpoise. II. The\nAlgerine Porpoise. III. The Mealy-mouthed Porpoise.\n\nTo those who have not chanced specially to study the subject, it may possibly\nseem strange, that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five feet should be\nmarshalled among WHALES—a word, which, in the popular sense, always conveys an\nidea of hugeness. But the creatures set down above as Duodecimoes are infallibly\nwhales, by the terms of my definition of what a whale is—i.e. a spouting fish,\nwith a horizontal tail.\n\nBOOK III. (Duodecimo), CHAPTER 1. (Huzza Porpoise).—This is the common porpoise\nfound almost all over the globe. The name is of my own bestowal; for there are\nmore than one sort of porpoises, and something must be done to distinguish them.\nI call him thus, because he always swims in hilarious shoals, which upon the\nbroad sea keep tossing themselves to heaven like caps in a Fourth-of-July crowd.\nTheir appearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner. Full of fine\nspirits, they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward. They are the\nlads that always live before the wind. They are accounted a lucky omen. If you\nyourself can withstand three cheers at beholding these vivacious fish, then\nheaven help ye; the spirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye. A well-fed, plump\nHuzza Porpoise will yield you one good gallon of good oil. But the fine and\ndelicate fluid extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable. It is in request\namong jewellers and watchmakers. Sailors put it on their hones. Porpoise meat is\ngood eating, you know. It may never have occurred to you that a porpoise spouts.\nIndeed, his spout is so small that it is not very readily discernible. But the\nnext time you have a chance, watch him; and you will then see the great Sperm\nwhale himself in miniature.\n\nBOOK III. (Duodecimo), CHAPTER II. (Algerine Porpoise).—A pirate. Very savage.\nHe is only found, I think, in the Pacific. He is somewhat larger than the Huzza\nPorpoise, but much of the same general make. Provoke him, and he will buckle to\na shark. I have lowered for him many times, but never yet saw him captured.\n\nBOOK III. (Duodecimo), CHAPTER III. (Mealy-mouthed Porpoise).—The largest kind\nof Porpoise; and only found in the Pacific, so far as it is known. The only\nEnglish name, by which he has hitherto been designated, is that of the\nfishers—Right-Whale Porpoise, from the circumstance that he is chiefly found in\nthe vicinity of that Folio. In shape, he differs in some degree from the Huzza\nPorpoise, being of a less rotund and jolly girth; indeed, he is of quite a neat\nand gentleman-like figure. He has no fins on his back (most other porpoises\nhave), he has a lovely tail, and sentimental Indian eyes of a hazel hue. But his\nmealy-mouth spoils all. Though his entire back down to his side fins is of a\ndeep sable, yet a boundary line, distinct as the mark in a ship’s hull, called\nthe “bright waist,” that line streaks him from stem to stern, with two separate\ncolours, black above and white below. The white comprises part of his head, and\nthe whole of his mouth, which makes him look as if he had just escaped from a\nfelonious visit to a meal-bag. A most mean and mealy aspect! His oil is much\nlike that of the common porpoise.\n\n* * * * * *\n\nBeyond the DUODECIMO, this system does not proceed, inasmuch as the Porpoise is\nthe smallest of the whales. Above, you have all the Leviathans of note. But\nthere are a rabble of uncertain, fugitive, half-fabulous whales, which, as an\nAmerican whaleman, I know by reputation, but not personally. I shall enumerate\nthem by their fore-castle appellations; for possibly such a list may be valuable\nto future investigators, who may complete what I have here but begun. If any of\nthe following whales, shall hereafter be caught and marked, then he can readily\nbe incorporated into this System, according to his Folio, Octavo, or Duodecimo\nmagnitude:—The Bottle-Nose Whale; the Junk Whale; the Pudding-Headed Whale; the\nCape Whale; the Leading Whale; the Cannon Whale; the Scragg Whale; the Coppered\nWhale; the Elephant Whale; the Iceberg Whale; the Quog Whale; the Blue Whale;\netc. From Icelandic, Dutch, and old English authorities, there might be quoted\nother lists of uncertain whales, blessed with all manner of uncouth names. But I\nomit them as altogether obsolete; and can hardly help suspecting them for mere\nsounds, full of Leviathanism, but signifying nothing.\n\nFinally: It was stated at the outset, that this system would not be here, and at\nonce, perfected. You cannot but plainly see that I have kept my word. But I now\nleave my cetological System standing thus unfinished, even as the great\nCathedral of Cologne was left, with the crane still standing upon the top of the\nuncompleted tower. For small erections may be finished by their first\narchitects; grand ones, true ones, ever leave the copestone to posterity. God\nkeep me from ever completing anything. This whole book is but a draught—nay, but\nthe draught of a draught. Oh, Time, Strength, Cash, and Patience!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 33. THE SPECKSNYDER.\n\nConcerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a place as any to\nset down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board, arising from the existence\nof the harpooneer class of officers, a class unknown of course in any other\nmarine than the whale-fleet.\n\nThe large importance attached to the harpooneer’s vocation is evinced by the\nfact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries and more ago, the\ncommand of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the person now called the\ncaptain, but was divided between him and an officer called the Specksnyder.\nLiterally this word means Fat-Cutter; usage, however, in time made it equivalent\nto Chief Harpooneer. In those days, the captain’s authority was restricted to\nthe navigation and general management of the vessel; while over the\nwhale-hunting department and all its concerns, the Specksnyder or Chief\nHarpooneer reigned supreme. In the British Greenland Fishery, under the\ncorrupted title of Specksioneer, this old Dutch official is still retained, but\nhis former dignity is sadly abridged. At present he ranks simply as senior\nHarpooneer; and as such, is but one of the captain’s more inferior subalterns.\nNevertheless, as upon the good conduct of the harpooneers the success of a\nwhaling voyage largely depends, and since in the American Fishery he is not only\nan important officer in the boat, but under certain circumstances (night watches\non a whaling ground) the command of the ship’s deck is also his; therefore the\ngrand political maxim of the sea demands, that he should nominally live apart\nfrom the men before the mast, and be in some way distinguished as their\nprofessional superior; though always, by them, familiarly regarded as their\nsocial equal.\n\nNow, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is this—the\nfirst lives aft, the last forward. Hence, in whale-ships and merchantmen alike,\nthe mates have their quarters with the captain; and so, too, in most of the\nAmerican whalers the harpooneers are lodged in the after part of the ship. That\nis to say, they take their meals in the captain’s cabin, and sleep in a place\nindirectly communicating with it.\n\nThough the long period of a Southern whaling voyage (by far the longest of all\nvoyages now or ever made by man), the peculiar perils of it, and the community\nof interest prevailing among a company, all of whom, high or low, depend for\ntheir profits, not upon fixed wages, but upon their common luck, together with\ntheir common vigilance, intrepidity, and hard work; though all these things do\nin some cases tend to beget a less rigorous discipline than in merchantmen\ngenerally; yet, never mind how much like an old Mesopotamian family these\nwhalemen may, in some primitive instances, live together; for all that, the\npunctilious externals, at least, of the quarter-deck are seldom materially\nrelaxed, and in no instance done away. Indeed, many are the Nantucket ships in\nwhich you will see the skipper parading his quarter-deck with an elated grandeur\nnot surpassed in any military navy; nay, extorting almost as much outward homage\nas if he wore the imperial purple, and not the shabbiest of pilot-cloth.\n\nAnd though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least given to\nthat sort of shallowest assumption; and though the only homage he ever exacted,\nwas implicit, instantaneous obedience; though he required no man to remove the\nshoes from his feet ere stepping upon the quarter-deck; and though there were\ntimes when, owing to peculiar circumstances connected with events hereafter to\nbe detailed, he addressed them in unusual terms, whether of condescension or in\nterrorem, or otherwise; yet even Captain Ahab was by no means unobservant of the\nparamount forms and usages of the sea.\n\nNor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind those forms\nand usages, as it were, he sometimes masked himself; incidentally making use of\nthem for other and more private ends than they were legitimately intended to\nsubserve. That certain sultanism of his brain, which had otherwise in a good\ndegree remained unmanifested; through those forms that same sultanism became\nincarnate in an irresistible dictatorship. For be a man’s intellectual\nsuperiority what it will, it can never assume the practical, available supremacy\nover other men, without the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments,\nalways, in themselves, more or less paltry and base. This it is, that for ever\nkeeps God’s true princes of the Empire from the world’s hustings; and leaves the\nhighest honors that this air can give, to those men who become famous more\nthrough their infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful of the Divine\nInert, than through their undoubted superiority over the dead level of the mass.\nSuch large virtue lurks in these small things when extreme political\nsuperstitions invest them, that in some royal instances even to idiot imbecility\nthey have imparted potency. But when, as in the case of Nicholas the Czar, the\nringed crown of geographical empire encircles an imperial brain; then, the\nplebeian herds crouch abased before the tremendous centralization. Nor, will the\ntragic dramatist who would depict mortal indomitableness in its fullest sweep\nand direct swing, ever forget a hint, incidentally so important in his art, as\nthe one now alluded to.\n\nBut Ahab, my Captain, still moves before me in all his Nantucket grimness and\nshagginess; and in this episode touching Emperors and Kings, I must not conceal\nthat I have only to do with a poor old whale-hunter like him; and, therefore,\nall outward majestical trappings and housings are denied me. Oh, Ahab! what\nshall be grand in thee, it must needs be plucked at from the skies, and dived\nfor in the deep, and featured in the unbodied air!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 34. THE CABIN-TABLE.\n\nIt is noon; and Dough-Boy, the steward, thrusting his pale loaf-of-bread face\nfrom the cabin-scuttle, announces dinner to his lord and master; who, sitting in\nthe lee quarter-boat, has just been taking an observation of the sun; and is now\nmutely reckoning the latitude on the smooth, medallion-shaped tablet, reserved\nfor that daily purpose on the upper part of his ivory leg. From his complete\ninattention to the tidings, you would think that moody Ahab had not heard his\nmenial. But presently, catching hold of the mizen shrouds, he swings himself to\nthe deck, and in an even, unexhilarated voice, saying, “Dinner, Mr. Starbuck,”\ndisappears into the cabin.\n\nWhen the last echo of his sultan’s step has died away, and Starbuck, the first\nEmir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated, then Starbuck rouses from\nhis quietude, takes a few turns along the planks, and, after a grave peep into\nthe binnacle, says, with some touch of pleasantness, “Dinner, Mr. Stubb,” and\ndescends the scuttle. The second Emir lounges about the rigging awhile, and then\nslightly shaking the main brace, to see whether it will be all right with that\nimportant rope, he likewise takes up the old burden, and with a rapid “Dinner,\nMr. Flask,” follows after his predecessors.\n\nBut the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck, seems to\nfeel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping all sorts of knowing\nwinks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off his shoes, he strikes into a\nsharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right over the Grand Turk’s head; and\nthen, by a dexterous sleight, pitching his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf,\nhe goes down rollicking so far at least as he remains visible from the deck,\nreversing all other processions, by bringing up the rear with music. But ere\nstepping into the cabin doorway below, he pauses, ships a new face altogether,\nand, then, independent, hilarious little Flask enters King Ahab’s presence, in\nthe character of Abjectus, or the Slave.\n\nIt is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense artificialness\nof sea-usages, that while in the open air of the deck some officers will, upon\nprovocation, bear themselves boldly and defyingly enough towards their\ncommander; yet, ten to one, let those very officers the next moment go down to\ntheir customary dinner in that same commander’s cabin, and straightway their\ninoffensive, not to say deprecatory and humble air towards him, as he sits at\nthe head of the table; this is marvellous, sometimes most comical. Wherefore\nthis difference? A problem? Perhaps not. To have been Belshazzar, King of\nBabylon; and to have been Belshazzar, not haughtily but courteously, therein\ncertainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur. But he who in the\nrightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own private dinner-table\nof invited guests, that man’s unchallenged power and dominion of individual\ninfluence for the time; that man’s royalty of state transcends Belshazzar’s, for\nBelshazzar was not the greatest. Who has but once dined his friends, has tasted\nwhat it is to be Cæsar. It is a witchery of social czarship which there is no\nwithstanding. Now, if to this consideration you superadd the official supremacy\nof a ship-master, then, by inference, you will derive the cause of that\npeculiarity of sea-life just mentioned.\n\nOver his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute, maned sea-lion on the\nwhite coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but still deferential cubs. In his\nown proper turn, each officer waited to be served. They were as little children\nbefore Ahab; and yet, in Ahab, there seemed not to lurk the smallest social\narrogance. With one mind, their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man’s\nknife, as he carved the chief dish before him. I do not suppose that for the\nworld they would have profaned that moment with the slightest observation, even\nupon so neutral a topic as the weather. No! And when reaching out his knife and\nfork, between which the slice of beef was locked, Ahab thereby motioned\nStarbuck’s plate towards him, the mate received his meat as though receiving\nalms; and cut it tenderly; and a little started if, perchance, the knife grazed\nagainst the plate; and chewed it noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without\ncircumspection. For, like the Coronation banquet at Frankfort, where the German\nEmperor profoundly dines with the seven Imperial Electors, so these cabin meals\nwere somehow solemn meals, eaten in awful silence; and yet at table old Ahab\nforbade not conversation; only he himself was dumb. What a relief it was to\nchoking Stubb, when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below. And poor\nlittle Flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy of this weary family\nparty. His were the shinbones of the saline beef; his would have been the\ndrumsticks. For Flask to have presumed to help himself, this must have seemed to\nhim tantamount to larceny in the first degree. Had he helped himself at that\ntable, doubtless, never more would he have been able to hold his head up in this\nhonest world; nevertheless, strange to say, Ahab never forbade him. And had\nFlask helped himself, the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it.\nLeast of all, did Flask presume to help himself to butter. Whether he thought\nthe owners of the ship denied it to him, on account of its clotting his clear,\nsunny complexion; or whether he deemed that, on so long a voyage in such\nmarketless waters, butter was at a premium, and therefore was not for him, a\nsubaltern; however it was, Flask, alas! was a butterless man!\n\nAnother thing. Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and Flask is the\nfirst man up. Consider! For hereby Flask’s dinner was badly jammed in point of\ntime. Starbuck and Stubb both had the start of him; and yet they also have the\nprivilege of lounging in the rear. If Stubb even, who is but a peg higher than\nFlask, happens to have but a small appetite, and soon shows symptoms of\nconcluding his repast, then Flask must bestir himself, he will not get more than\nthree mouthfuls that day; for it is against holy usage for Stubb to precede\nFlask to the deck. Therefore it was that Flask once admitted in private, that\never since he had arisen to the dignity of an officer, from that moment he had\nnever known what it was to be otherwise than hungry, more or less. For what he\nate did not so much relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal in him. Peace and\nsatisfaction, thought Flask, have for ever departed from my stomach. I am an\nofficer; but, how I wish I could fish a bit of old-fashioned beef in the\nforecastle, as I used to when I was before the mast. There’s the fruits of\npromotion now; there’s the vanity of glory: there’s the insanity of life!\nBesides, if it were so that any mere sailor of the Pequod had a grudge against\nFlask in Flask’s official capacity, all that sailor had to do, in order to\nobtain ample vengeance, was to go aft at dinner-time, and get a peep at Flask\nthrough the cabin sky-light, sitting silly and dumfoundered before awful Ahab.\n\nNow, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table in the\nPequod’s cabin. After their departure, taking place in inverted order to their\narrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or rather was restored to some hurried\norder by the pallid steward. And then the three harpooneers were bidden to the\nfeast, they being its residuary legatees. They made a sort of temporary\nservants’ hall of the high and mighty cabin.\n\nIn strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless invisible\ndomineerings of the captain’s table, was the entire care-free license and ease,\nthe almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows the harpooneers. While\ntheir masters, the mates, seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of their own\njaws, the harpooneers chewed their food with such a relish that there was a\nreport to it. They dined like lords; they filled their bellies like Indian ships\nall day loading with spices. Such portentous appetites had Queequeg and\nTashtego, that to fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast, often the\npale Dough-Boy was fain to bring on a great baron of salt-junk, seemingly\nquarried out of the solid ox. And if he were not lively about it, if he did not\ngo with a nimble hop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of\naccelerating him by darting a fork at his back, harpoon-wise. And once Daggoo,\nseized with a sudden humor, assisted Dough-Boy’s memory by snatching him up\nbodily, and thrusting his head into a great empty wooden trencher, while\nTashtego, knife in hand, began laying out the circle preliminary to scalping\nhim. He was naturally a very nervous, shuddering sort of little fellow, this\nbread-faced steward; the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse. And\nwhat with the standing spectacle of the black terrific Ahab, and the periodical\ntumultuous visitations of these three savages, Dough-Boy’s whole life was one\ncontinual lip-quiver. Commonly, after seeing the harpooneers furnished with all\nthings they demanded, he would escape from their clutches into his little pantry\nadjoining, and fearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door, till\nall was over.\n\nIt was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego, opposing his filed\nteeth to the Indian’s: crosswise to them, Daggoo seated on the floor, for a\nbench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to the low carlines; at every\nmotion of his colossal limbs, making the low cabin framework to shake, as when\nan African elephant goes passenger in a ship. But for all this, the great negro\nwas wonderfully abstemious, not to say dainty. It seemed hardly possible that by\nsuch comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused\nthrough so broad, baronial, and superb a person. But, doubtless, this noble\nsavage fed strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air; and through\nhis dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds. Not by beef or\nby bread, are giants made or nourished. But Queequeg, he had a mortal, barbaric\nsmack of the lip in eating—an ugly sound enough—so much so, that the trembling\nDough-Boy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth lurked in his own lean\narms. And when he would hear Tashtego singing out for him to produce himself,\nthat his bones might be picked, the simple-witted steward all but shattered the\ncrockery hanging round him in the pantry, by his sudden fits of the palsy. Nor\ndid the whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for their\nlances and other weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner, they would\nostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did not at all tend to\ntranquillize poor Dough-Boy. How could he forget that in his Island days,\nQueequeg, for one, must certainly have been guilty of some murderous, convivial\nindiscretions. Alas! Dough-Boy! hard fares the white waiter who waits upon\ncannibals. Not a napkin should he carry on his arm, but a buckler. In good time,\nthough, to his great delight, the three salt-sea warriors would rise and depart;\nto his credulous, fable-mongering ears, all their martial bones jingling in them\nat every step, like Moorish scimetars in scabbards.\n\nBut, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and nominally lived there;\nstill, being anything but sedentary in their habits, they were scarcely ever in\nit except at mealtimes, and just before sleeping-time, when they passed through\nit to their own peculiar quarters.\n\nIn this one matter, Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale captains,\nwho, as a set, rather incline to the opinion that by rights the ship’s cabin\nbelongs to them; and that it is by courtesy alone that anybody else is, at any\ntime, permitted there. So that, in real truth, the mates and harpooneers of the\nPequod might more properly be said to have lived out of the cabin than in it.\nFor when they did enter it, it was something as a street-door enters a house;\nturning inwards for a moment, only to be turned out the next; and, as a\npermanent thing, residing in the open air. Nor did they lose much hereby; in the\ncabin was no companionship; socially, Ahab was inaccessible. Though nominally\nincluded in the census of Christendom, he was still an alien to it. He lived in\nthe world, as the last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled Missouri. And as\nwhen Spring and Summer had departed, that wild Logan of the woods, burying\nhimself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the winter there, sucking his own\npaws; so, in his inclement, howling old age, Ahab’s soul, shut up in the caved\ntrunk of his body, there fed upon the sullen paws of its gloom!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 35. THE MAST-HEAD.\n\nIt was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with the other\nseamen my first mast-head came round.\n\nIn most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost simultaneously with\nthe vessel’s leaving her port; even though she may have fifteen thousand miles,\nand more, to sail ere reaching her proper cruising ground. And if, after a\nthree, four, or five years’ voyage she is drawing nigh home with anything empty\nin her—say, an empty vial even—then, her mast-heads are kept manned to the last;\nand not till her skysail-poles sail in among the spires of the port, does she\naltogether relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more.\n\nNow, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a very ancient\nand interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate here. I take it, that the\nearliest standers of mast-heads were the old Egyptians; because, in all my\nresearches, I find none prior to them. For though their progenitors, the\nbuilders of Babel, must doubtless, by their tower, have intended to rear the\nloftiest mast-head in all Asia, or Africa either; yet (ere the final truck was\nput to it) as that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the\nboard, in the dread gale of God’s wrath; therefore, we cannot give these Babel\nbuilders priority over the Egyptians. And that the Egyptians were a nation of\nmast-head standers, is an assertion based upon the general belief among\narchæologists, that the first pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes: a\ntheory singularly supported by the peculiar stair-like formation of all four\nsides of those edifices; whereby, with prodigious long upliftings of their legs,\nthose old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex, and sing out for new\nstars; even as the look-outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail, or a whale\njust bearing in sight. In Saint Stylites, the famous Christian hermit of old\ntimes, who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole\nlatter portion of his life on its summit, hoisting his food from the ground with\na tackle; in him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless\nstander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his place by fogs or\nfrosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing everything out to the last,\nliterally died at his post. Of modern standers-of-mast-heads we have but a\nlifeless set; mere stone, iron, and bronze men; who, though well capable of\nfacing out a stiff gale, are still entirely incompetent to the business of\nsinging out upon discovering any strange sight. There is Napoleon; who, upon the\ntop of the column of Vendome, stands with arms folded, some one hundred and\nfifty feet in the air; careless, now, who rules the decks below; whether Louis\nPhilippe, Louis Blanc, or Louis the Devil. Great Washington, too, stands high\naloft on his towering main-mast in Baltimore, and like one of Hercules’ pillars,\nhis column marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go.\nAdmiral Nelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his mast-head in\nTrafalgar Square; and ever when most obscured by that London smoke, token is yet\ngiven that a hidden hero is there; for where there is smoke, must be fire. But\nneither great Washington, nor Napoleon, nor Nelson, will answer a single hail\nfrom below, however madly invoked to befriend by their counsels the distracted\ndecks upon which they gaze; however it may be surmised, that their spirits\npenetrate through the thick haze of the future, and descry what shoals and what\nrocks must be shunned.\n\nIt may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head standers of the\nland with those of the sea; but that in truth it is not so, is plainly evinced\nby an item for which Obed Macy, the sole historian of Nantucket, stands\naccountable. The worthy Obed tells us, that in the early times of the whale\nfishery, ere ships were regularly launched in pursuit of the game, the people of\nthat island erected lofty spars along the sea-coast, to which the look-outs\nascended by means of nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs in a\nhen-house. A few years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of New\nZealand, who, upon descrying the game, gave notice to the ready-manned boats\nnigh the beach. But this custom has now become obsolete; turn we then to the one\nproper mast-head, that of a whale-ship at sea. The three mast-heads are kept\nmanned from sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen taking their regular turns (as at\nthe helm), and relieving each other every two hours. In the serene weather of\nthe tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast-head; nay, to a dreamy\nmeditative man it is delightful. There you stand, a hundred feet above the\nsilent decks, striding along the deep, as if the masts were gigantic stilts,\nwhile beneath you and between your legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters of\nthe sea, even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous Colossus at\nold Rhodes. There you stand, lost in the infinite series of the sea, with\nnothing ruffled but the waves. The tranced ship indolently rolls; the drowsy\ntrade winds blow; everything resolves you into languor. For the most part, in\nthis tropic whaling life, a sublime uneventfulness invests you; you hear no\nnews; read no gazettes; extras with startling accounts of commonplaces never\ndelude you into unnecessary excitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions;\nbankrupt securities; fall of stocks; are never troubled with the thought of what\nyou shall have for dinner—for all your meals for three years and more are snugly\nstowed in casks, and your bill of fare is immutable.\n\nIn one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years’ voyage, as\noften happens, the sum of the various hours you spend at the mast-head would\namount to several entire months. And it is much to be deplored that the place to\nwhich you devote so considerable a portion of the whole term of your natural\nlife, should be so sadly destitute of anything approaching to a cosy\ninhabitiveness, or adapted to breed a comfortable localness of feeling, such as\npertains to a bed, a hammock, a hearse, a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach, or any\nother of those small and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate\nthemselves. Your most usual point of perch is the head of the t’ gallant-mast,\nwhere you stand upon two thin parallel sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen)\ncalled the t’ gallant cross-trees. Here, tossed about by the sea, the beginner\nfeels about as cosy as he would standing on a bull’s horns. To be sure, in cold\nweather you may carry your house aloft with you, in the shape of a watch-coat;\nbut properly speaking the thickest watch-coat is no more of a house than the\nunclad body; for as the soul is glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle, and\ncannot freely move about in it, nor even move out of it, without running great\nrisk of perishing (like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps in winter);\nso a watch-coat is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope, or\nadditional skin encasing you. You cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in your\nbody, and no more can you make a convenient closet of your watch-coat.\n\nConcerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of a southern\nwhale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or pulpits, called\ncrow’s-nests, in which the look-outs of a Greenland whaler are protected from\nthe inclement weather of the frozen seas. In the fireside narrative of Captain\nSleet, entitled “A Voyage among the Icebergs, in quest of the Greenland Whale,\nand incidentally for the re-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of Old\nGreenland;” in this admirable volume, all standers of mast-heads are furnished\nwith a charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented\ncrow’s-nest of the Glacier, which was the name of Captain Sleet’s good craft. He\ncalled it the Sleet’s crow’s-nest, in honor of himself; he being the original\ninventor and patentee, and free from all ridiculous false delicacy, and holding\nthat if we call our own children after our own names (we fathers being the\noriginal inventors and patentees), so likewise should we denominate after\nourselves any other apparatus we may beget. In shape, the Sleet’s crow’s-nest is\nsomething like a large tierce or pipe; it is open above, however, where it is\nfurnished with a movable side-screen to keep to windward of your head in a hard\ngale. Being fixed on the summit of the mast, you ascend into it through a little\ntrap-hatch in the bottom. On the after side, or side next the stern of the ship,\nis a comfortable seat, with a locker underneath for umbrellas, comforters, and\ncoats. In front is a leather rack, in which to keep your speaking trumpet, pipe,\ntelescope, and other nautical conveniences. When Captain Sleet in person stood\nhis mast-head in this crow’s-nest of his, he tells us that he always had a rifle\nwith him (also fixed in the rack), together with a powder flask and shot, for\nthe purpose of popping off the stray narwhales, or vagrant sea unicorns\ninfesting those waters; for you cannot successfully shoot at them from the deck\nowing to the resistance of the water, but to shoot down upon them is a very\ndifferent thing. Now, it was plainly a labor of love for Captain Sleet to\ndescribe, as he does, all the little detailed conveniences of his crow’s-nest;\nbut though he so enlarges upon many of these, and though he treats us to a very\nscientific account of his experiments in this crow’s-nest, with a small compass\nhe kept there for the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from what is\ncalled the “local attraction” of all binnacle magnets; an error ascribable to\nthe horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ship’s planks, and in the Glacier’s\ncase, perhaps, to there having been so many broken-down blacksmiths among her\ncrew; I say, that though the Captain is very discreet and scientific here, yet,\nfor all his learned “binnacle deviations,” “azimuth compass observations,” and\n“approximate errors,” he knows very well, Captain Sleet, that he was not so much\nimmersed in those profound magnetic meditations, as to fail being attracted\noccasionally towards that well replenished little case-bottle, so nicely tucked\nin on one side of his crow’s nest, within easy reach of his hand. Though, upon\nthe whole, I greatly admire and even love the brave, the honest, and learned\nCaptain; yet I take it very ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that\ncase-bottle, seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have been,\nwhile with mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the mathematics\naloft there in that bird’s nest within three or four perches of the pole.\n\nBut if we Southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as Captain Sleet\nand his Greenlandmen were; yet that disadvantage is greatly counter-balanced by\nthe widely contrasting serenity of those seductive seas in which we South\nfishers mostly float. For one, I used to lounge up the rigging very leisurely,\nresting in the top to have a chat with Queequeg, or any one else off duty whom I\nmight find there; then ascending a little way further, and throwing a lazy leg\nover the top-sail yard, take a preliminary view of the watery pastures, and so\nat last mount to my ultimate destination.\n\nLet me make a clean breast of it here, and frankly admit that I kept but sorry\nguard. With the problem of the universe revolving in me, how could I—being left\ncompletely to myself at such a thought-engendering altitude—how could I but\nlightly hold my obligations to observe all whale-ships’ standing orders, “Keep\nyour weather eye open, and sing out every time.”\n\nAnd let me in this place movingly admonish you, ye ship-owners of Nantucket!\nBeware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with lean brow and hollow\neye; given to unseasonable meditativeness; and who offers to ship with the\nPhædon instead of Bowditch in his head. Beware of such an one, I say; your\nwhales must be seen before they can be killed; and this sunken-eyed young\nPlatonist will tow you ten wakes round the world, and never make you one pint of\nsperm the richer. Nor are these monitions at all unneeded. For nowadays, the\nwhale-fishery furnishes an asylum for many romantic, melancholy, and\nabsent-minded young men, disgusted with the carking cares of earth, and seeking\nsentiment in tar and blubber. Childe Harold not unfrequently perches himself\nupon the mast-head of some luckless disappointed whale-ship, and in moody phrase\nejaculates:—\n\n      “Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll!\n      Ten thousand blubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain.”\n\n\nVery often do the captains of such ships take those absent-minded young\nphilosophers to task, upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient “interest” in\nthe voyage; half-hinting that they are so hopelessly lost to all honorable\nambition, as that in their secret souls they would rather not see whales than\notherwise. But all in vain; those young Platonists have a notion that their\nvision is imperfect; they are short-sighted; what use, then, to strain the\nvisual nerve? They have left their opera-glasses at home.\n\n“Why, thou monkey,” said a harpooneer to one of these lads, “we’ve been cruising\nnow hard upon three years, and thou hast not raised a whale yet. Whales are\nscarce as hen’s teeth whenever thou art up here.” Perhaps they were; or perhaps\nthere might have been shoals of them in the far horizon; but lulled into such an\nopium-like listlessness of vacant, unconscious reverie is this absent-minded\nyouth by the blending cadence of waves with thoughts, that at last he loses his\nidentity; takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep,\nblue, bottomless soul, pervading mankind and nature; and every strange,\nhalf-seen, gliding, beautiful thing that eludes him; every dimly-discovered,\nuprising fin of some undiscernible form, seems to him the embodiment of those\nelusive thoughts that only people the soul by continually flitting through it.\nIn this enchanted mood, thy spirit ebbs away to whence it came; becomes diffused\nthrough time and space; like Cranmer’s sprinkled Pantheistic ashes, forming at\nlast a part of every shore the round globe over.\n\nThere is no life in thee, now, except that rocking life imparted by a gently\nrolling ship; by her, borrowed from the sea; by the sea, from the inscrutable\ntides of God. But while this sleep, this dream is on ye, move your foot or hand\nan inch; slip your hold at all; and your identity comes back in horror. Over\nDescartian vortices you hover. And perhaps, at mid-day, in the fairest weather,\nwith one half-throttled shriek you drop through that transparent air into the\nsummer sea, no more to rise for ever. Heed it well, ye Pantheists!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 36. THE QUARTER-DECK.\n\n(Enter Ahab: Then, all.)\n\nIt was not a great while after the affair of the pipe, that one morning shortly\nafter breakfast, Ahab, as was his wont, ascended the cabin-gangway to the deck.\nThere most sea-captains usually walk at that hour, as country gentlemen, after\nthe same meal, take a few turns in the garden.\n\nSoon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced his old rounds,\nupon planks so familiar to his tread, that they were all over dented, like\ngeological stones, with the peculiar mark of his walk. Did you fixedly gaze,\ntoo, upon that ribbed and dented brow; there also, you would see still stranger\nfoot-prints—the foot-prints of his one unsleeping, ever-pacing thought.\n\nBut on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even as his nervous\nstep that morning left a deeper mark. And, so full of his thought was Ahab, that\nat every uniform turn that he made, now at the main-mast and now at the\nbinnacle, you could almost see that thought turn in him as he turned, and pace\nin him as he paced; so completely possessing him, indeed, that it all but seemed\nthe inward mould of every outer movement.\n\n“D’ye mark him, Flask?” whispered Stubb; “the chick that’s in him pecks the\nshell. ’Twill soon be out.”\n\nThe hours wore on;—Ahab now shut up within his cabin; anon, pacing the deck,\nwith the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect.\n\nIt drew near the close of day. Suddenly he came to a halt by the bulwarks, and\ninserting his bone leg into the auger-hole there, and with one hand grasping a\nshroud, he ordered Starbuck to send everybody aft.\n\n“Sir!” said the mate, astonished at an order seldom or never given on ship-board\nexcept in some extraordinary case.\n\n“Send everybody aft,” repeated Ahab. “Mast-heads, there! come down!”\n\nWhen the entire ship’s company were assembled, and with curious and not wholly\nunapprehensive faces, were eyeing him, for he looked not unlike the weather\nhorizon when a storm is coming up, Ahab, after rapidly glancing over the\nbulwarks, and then darting his eyes among the crew, started from his standpoint;\nand as though not a soul were nigh him resumed his heavy turns upon the deck.\nWith bent head and half-slouched hat he continued to pace, unmindful of the\nwondering whispering among the men; till Stubb cautiously whispered to Flask,\nthat Ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a\npedestrian feat. But this did not last long. Vehemently pausing, he cried:—\n\n“What do ye do when ye see a whale, men?”\n\n“Sing out for him!” was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed voices.\n\n“Good!” cried Ahab, with a wild approval in his tones; observing the hearty\nanimation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically thrown them.\n\n“And what do ye next, men?”\n\n“Lower away, and after him!”\n\n“And what tune is it ye pull to, men?”\n\n“A dead whale or a stove boat!”\n\nMore and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving, grew the countenance of\nthe old man at every shout; while the mariners began to gaze curiously at each\nother, as if marvelling how it was that they themselves became so excited at\nsuch seemingly purposeless questions.\n\nBut, they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in his\npivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud, and tightly, almost\nconvulsively grasping it, addressed them thus:—\n\n“All ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a white whale.\nLook ye! d’ye see this Spanish ounce of gold?”—holding up a broad bright coin to\nthe sun—“it is a sixteen dollar piece, men. D’ye see it? Mr. Starbuck, hand me\nyon top-maul.”\n\nWhile the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking, was slowly\nrubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if to heighten its\nlustre, and without using any words was meanwhile lowly humming to himself,\nproducing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticulate that it seemed the\nmechanical humming of the wheels of his vitality in him.\n\nReceiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the main-mast with the\nhammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold with the other, and with a high\nraised voice exclaiming: “Whosoever of ye raises me a white-headed whale with a\nwrinkled brow and a crooked jaw; whosoever of ye raises me that white-headed\nwhale, with three holes punctured in his starboard fluke—look ye, whosoever of\nye raises me that same white whale, he shall have this gold ounce, my boys!”\n\n“Huzza! huzza!” cried the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins they hailed the\nact of nailing the gold to the mast.\n\n“It’s a white whale, I say,” resumed Ahab, as he threw down the topmaul: “a\nwhite whale. Skin your eyes for him, men; look sharp for white water; if ye see\nbut a bubble, sing out.”\n\nAll this while Tashtego, Daggoo, and Queequeg had looked on with even more\nintense interest and surprise than the rest, and at the mention of the wrinkled\nbrow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was separately touched by some\nspecific recollection.\n\n“Captain Ahab,” said Tashtego, “that white whale must be the same that some call\nMoby Dick.”\n\n“Moby Dick?” shouted Ahab. “Do ye know the white whale then, Tash?”\n\n“Does he fan-tail a little curious, sir, before he goes down?” said the\nGay-Header deliberately.\n\n“And has he a curious spout, too,” said Daggoo, “very bushy, even for a\nparmacetty, and mighty quick, Captain Ahab?”\n\n“And he have one, two, three—oh! good many iron in him hide, too, Captain,”\ncried Queequeg disjointedly, “all twiske-tee be-twisk, like him—him—” faltering\nhard for a word, and screwing his hand round and round as though uncorking a\nbottle—“like him—him—”\n\n“Corkscrew!” cried Ahab, “aye, Queequeg, the harpoons lie all twisted and\nwrenched in him; aye, Daggoo, his spout is a big one, like a whole shock of\nwheat, and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool after the great annual\nsheep-shearing; aye, Tashtego, and he fan-tails like a split jib in a squall.\nDeath and devils! men, it is Moby Dick ye have seen—Moby Dick—Moby Dick!”\n\n“Captain Ahab,” said Starbuck, who, with Stubb and Flask, had thus far been\neyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last seemed struck with a\nthought which somewhat explained all the wonder. “Captain Ahab, I have heard of\nMoby Dick—but it was not Moby Dick that took off thy leg?”\n\n“Who told thee that?” cried Ahab; then pausing, “Aye, Starbuck; aye, my hearties\nall round; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me; Moby Dick that brought me to this\ndead stump I stand on now. Aye, aye,” he shouted with a terrific, loud, animal\nsob, like that of a heart-stricken moose; “Aye, aye! it was that accursed white\nwhale that razeed me; made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a day!” Then\ntossing both arms, with measureless imprecations he shouted out: “Aye, aye! and\nI’ll chase him round Good Hope, and round the Horn, and round the Norway\nMaelstrom, and round perdition’s flames before I give him up. And this is what\nye have shipped for, men! to chase that white whale on both sides of land, and\nover all sides of earth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out. What say\nye, men, will ye splice hands on it, now? I think ye do look brave.”\n\n“Aye, aye!” shouted the harpooneers and seamen, running closer to the excited\nold man: “A sharp eye for the white whale; a sharp lance for Moby Dick!”\n\n“God bless ye,” he seemed to half sob and half shout. “God bless ye, men.\nSteward! go draw the great measure of grog. But what’s this long face about, Mr.\nStarbuck; wilt thou not chase the white whale? art not game for Moby Dick?”\n\n“I am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of Death too, Captain Ahab, if\nit fairly comes in the way of the business we follow; but I came here to hunt\nwhales, not my commander’s vengeance. How many barrels will thy vengeance yield\nthee even if thou gettest it, Captain Ahab? it will not fetch thee much in our\nNantucket market.”\n\n“Nantucket market! Hoot! But come closer, Starbuck; thou requirest a little\nlower layer. If money’s to be the measurer, man, and the accountants have\ncomputed their great counting-house the globe, by girdling it with guineas, one\nto every three parts of an inch; then, let me tell thee, that my vengeance will\nfetch a great premium here!”\n\n“He smites his chest,” whispered Stubb, “what’s that for? methinks it rings most\nvast, but hollow.”\n\n“Vengeance on a dumb brute!” cried Starbuck, “that simply smote thee from\nblindest instinct! Madness! To be enraged with a dumb thing, Captain Ahab, seems\nblasphemous.”\n\n“Hark ye yet again—the little lower layer. All visible objects, man, are but as\npasteboard masks. But in each event—in the living act, the undoubted deed—there,\nsome unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth the mouldings of its features\nfrom behind the unreasoning mask. If man will strike, strike through the mask!\nHow can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall? To me,\nthe white whale is that wall, shoved near to me. Sometimes I think there’s\nnaught beyond. But ’tis enough. He tasks me; he heaps me; I see in him\noutrageous strength, with an inscrutable malice sinewing it. That inscrutable\nthing is chiefly what I hate; and be the white whale agent, or be the white\nwhale principal, I will wreak that hate upon him. Talk not to me of blasphemy,\nman; I’d strike the sun if it insulted me. For could the sun do that, then could\nI do the other; since there is ever a sort of fair play herein, jealousy\npresiding over all creations. But not my master, man, is even that fair play.\nWho’s over me? Truth hath no confines. Take off thine eye! more intolerable than\nfiends’ glarings is a doltish stare! So, so; thou reddenest and palest; my heat\nhas melted thee to anger-glow. But look ye, Starbuck, what is said in heat, that\nthing unsays itself. There are men from whom warm words are small indignity. I\nmeant not to incense thee. Let it go. Look! see yonder Turkish cheeks of spotted\ntawn—living, breathing pictures painted by the sun. The Pagan leopards—the\nunrecking and unworshipping things, that live; and seek, and give no reasons for\nthe torrid life they feel! The crew, man, the crew! Are they not one and all\nwith Ahab, in this matter of the whale? See Stubb! he laughs! See yonder\nChilian! he snorts to think of it. Stand up amid the general hurricane, thy one\ntost sapling cannot, Starbuck! And what is it? Reckon it. ’Tis but to help\nstrike a fin; no wondrous feat for Starbuck. What is it more? From this one poor\nhunt, then, the best lance out of all Nantucket, surely he will not hang back,\nwhen every foremast-hand has clutched a whetstone? Ah! constrainings seize thee;\nI see! the billow lifts thee! Speak, but speak!—Aye, aye! thy silence, then,\nthat voices thee. (Aside) Something shot from my dilated nostrils, he has\ninhaled it in his lungs. Starbuck now is mine; cannot oppose me now, without\nrebellion.”\n\n“God keep me!—keep us all!” murmured Starbuck, lowly.\n\nBut in his joy at the enchanted, tacit acquiescence of the mate, Ahab did not\nhear his foreboding invocation; nor yet the low laugh from the hold; nor yet the\npresaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage; nor yet the hollow flap of the\nsails against the masts, as for a moment their hearts sank in. For again\nStarbuck’s downcast eyes lighted up with the stubbornness of life; the\nsubterranean laugh died away; the winds blew on; the sails filled out; the ship\nheaved and rolled as before. Ah, ye admonitions and warnings! why stay ye not\nwhen ye come? But rather are ye predictions than warnings, ye shadows! Yet not\nso much predictions from without, as verifications of the foregoing things\nwithin. For with little external to constrain us, the innermost necessities in\nour being, these still drive us on.\n\n“The measure! the measure!” cried Ahab.\n\nReceiving the brimming pewter, and turning to the harpooneers, he ordered them\nto produce their weapons. Then ranging them before him near the capstan, with\ntheir harpoons in their hands, while his three mates stood at his side with\ntheir lances, and the rest of the ship’s company formed a circle round the\ngroup; he stood for an instant searchingly eyeing every man of his crew. But\nthose wild eyes met his, as the bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the\neye of their leader, ere he rushes on at their head in the trail of the bison;\nbut, alas! only to fall into the hidden snare of the Indian.\n\n“Drink and pass!” he cried, handing the heavy charged flagon to the nearest\nseaman. “The crew alone now drink. Round with it, round! Short draughts—long\nswallows, men; ’tis hot as Satan’s hoof. So, so; it goes round excellently. It\nspiralizes in ye; forks out at the serpent-snapping eye. Well done; almost\ndrained. That way it went, this way it comes. Hand it me—here’s a hollow! Men,\nye seem the years; so brimming life is gulped and gone. Steward, refill!\n\n“Attend now, my braves. I have mustered ye all round this capstan; and ye mates,\nflank me with your lances; and ye harpooneers, stand there with your irons; and\nye, stout mariners, ring me in, that I may in some sort revive a noble custom of\nmy fisherman fathers before me. O men, you will yet see that—Ha! boy, come back?\nbad pennies come not sooner. Hand it me. Why, now, this pewter had run brimming\nagain, wer’t not thou St. Vitus’ imp—away, thou ague!\n\n“Advance, ye mates! Cross your lances full before me. Well done! Let me touch\nthe axis.” So saying, with extended arm, he grasped the three level, radiating\nlances at their crossed centre; while so doing, suddenly and nervously twitched\nthem; meanwhile, glancing intently from Starbuck to Stubb; from Stubb to Flask.\nIt seemed as though, by some nameless, interior volition, he would fain have\nshocked into them the same fiery emotion accumulated within the Leyden jar of\nhis own magnetic life. The three mates quailed before his strong, sustained, and\nmystic aspect. Stubb and Flask looked sideways from him; the honest eye of\nStarbuck fell downright.\n\n“In vain!” cried Ahab; “but, maybe, ’tis well. For did ye three but once take\nthe full-forced shock, then mine own electric thing, that had perhaps expired\nfrom out me. Perchance, too, it would have dropped ye dead. Perchance ye need it\nnot. Down lances! And now, ye mates, I do appoint ye three cupbearers to my\nthree pagan kinsmen there—yon three most honorable gentlemen and noblemen, my\nvaliant harpooneers. Disdain the task? What, when the great Pope washes the feet\nof beggars, using his tiara for ewer? Oh, my sweet cardinals! your own\ncondescension, that shall bend ye to it. I do not order ye; ye will it. Cut your\nseizings and draw the poles, ye harpooneers!”\n\nSilently obeying the order, the three harpooneers now stood with the detached\niron part of their harpoons, some three feet long, held, barbs up, before him.\n\n“Stab me not with that keen steel! Cant them; cant them over! know ye not the\ngoblet end? Turn up the socket! So, so; now, ye cup-bearers, advance. The irons!\ntake them; hold them while I fill!” Forthwith, slowly going from one officer to\nthe other, he brimmed the harpoon sockets with the fiery waters from the pewter.\n\n“Now, three to three, ye stand. Commend the murderous chalices! Bestow them, ye\nwho are now made parties to this indissoluble league. Ha! Starbuck! but the deed\nis done! Yon ratifying sun now waits to sit upon it. Drink, ye harpooneers!\ndrink and swear, ye men that man the deathful whaleboat’s bow—Death to Moby\nDick! God hunt us all, if we do not hunt Moby Dick to his death!” The long,\nbarbed steel goblets were lifted; and to cries and maledictions against the\nwhite whale, the spirits were simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss. Starbuck\npaled, and turned, and shivered. Once more, and finally, the replenished pewter\nwent the rounds among the frantic crew; when, waving his free hand to them, they\nall dispersed; and Ahab retired within his cabin.\n\n"},{"title":"Test Section Title","content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 80. THE NUT.\n\nIf the Sperm Whale be physiognomically a Sphinx, to the phrenologist his brain\nseems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to square.\n\nIn the full-grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet in\nlength. Unhinge the lower jaw, and the side view of this skull is as the side of\na moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level base. But in life—as\nwe have elsewhere seen—this inclined plane is angularly filled up, and almost\nsquared by the enormous superincumbent mass of the junk and sperm. At the high\nend the skull forms a crater to bed that part of the mass; while under the long\nfloor of this crater—in another cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and\nas many in depth—reposes the mere handful of this monster’s brain. The brain is\nat least twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life; it is hidden away\nbehind its vast outworks, like the innermost citadel within the amplified\nfortifications of Quebec. So like a choice casket is it secreted in him, that I\nhave known some whalemen who peremptorily deny that the Sperm Whale has any\nother brain than that palpable semblance of one formed by the cubic-yards of his\nsperm magazine. Lying in strange folds, courses, and convolutions, to their\napprehensions, it seems more in keeping with the idea of his general might to\nregard that mystic part of him as the seat of his intelligence.\n\nIt is plain, then, that phrenologically the head of this Leviathan, in the\ncreature’s living intact state, is an entire delusion. As for his true brain,\nyou can then see no indications of it, nor feel any. The whale, like all things\nthat are mighty, wears a false brow to the common world.\n\nIf you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view of its\nrear end, which is the high end, you will be struck by its resemblance to the\nhuman skull, beheld in the same situation, and from the same point of view.\nIndeed, place this reversed skull (scaled down to the human magnitude) among a\nplate of men’s skulls, and you would involuntarily confound it with them; and\nremarking the depressions on one part of its summit, in phrenological phrase you\nwould say—This man had no self-esteem, and no veneration. And by those\nnegations, considered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and\npower, you can best form to yourself the truest, though not the most\nexhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is.\n\nBut if from the comparative dimensions of the whale’s proper brain, you deem it\nincapable of being adequately charted, then I have another idea for you. If you\nattentively regard almost any quadruped’s spine, you will be struck with the\nresemblance of its vertebræ to a strung necklace of dwarfed skulls, all bearing\nrudimental resemblance to the skull proper. It is a German conceit, that the\nvertebræ are absolutely undeveloped skulls. But the curious external\nresemblance, I take it the Germans were not the first men to perceive. A foreign\nfriend once pointed it out to me, in the skeleton of a foe he had slain, and\nwith the vertebræ of which he was inlaying, in a sort of basso-relievo, the\nbeaked prow of his canoe. Now, I consider that the phrenologists have omitted an\nimportant thing in not pushing their investigations from the cerebellum through\nthe spinal canal. For I believe that much of a man’s character will be found\nbetokened in his backbone. I would rather feel your spine than your skull,\nwhoever you are. A thin joist of a spine never yet upheld a full and noble soul.\nI rejoice in my spine, as in the firm audacious staff of that flag which I fling\nhalf out to the world.\n\nApply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale. His cranial cavity is\ncontinuous with the first neck-vertebra; and in that vertebra the bottom of the\nspinal canal will measure ten inches across, being eight in height, and of a\ntriangular figure with the base downwards. As it passes through the remaining\nvertebræ the canal tapers in size, but for a considerable distance remains of\nlarge capacity. Now, of course, this canal is filled with much the same\nstrangely fibrous substance—the spinal cord—as the brain; and directly\ncommunicates with the brain. And what is still more, for many feet after\nemerging from the brain’s cavity, the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing\ngirth, almost equal to that of the brain. Under all these circumstances, would\nit be unreasonable to survey and map out the whale’s spine phrenologically? For,\nviewed in this light, the wonderful comparative smallness of his brain proper is\nmore than compensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude of his spinal cord.\n\nBut leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists, I would\nmerely assume the spinal theory for a moment, in reference to the Sperm Whale’s\nhump. This august hump, if I mistake not, rises over one of the larger vertebræ,\nand is, therefore, in some sort, the outer convex mould of it. From its relative\nsituation then, I should call this high hump the organ of firmness or\nindomitableness in the Sperm Whale. And that the great monster is indomitable,\nyou will yet have reason to know.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 81. THE PEQUOD MEETS THE VIRGIN.\n\nThe predestinated day arrived, and we duly met the ship Jungfrau, Derick De\nDeer, master, of Bremen.\n\nAt one time the greatest whaling people in the world, the Dutch and Germans are\nnow among the least; but here and there at very wide intervals of latitude and\nlongitude, you still occasionally meet with their flag in the Pacific.\n\nFor some reason, the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects. While yet\nsome distance from the Pequod, she rounded to, and dropping a boat, her captain\nwas impelled towards us, impatiently standing in the bows instead of the stern.\n\n“What has he in his hand there?” cried Starbuck, pointing to something wavingly\nheld by the German. “Impossible!—a lamp-feeder!”\n\n“Not that,” said Stubb, “no, no, it’s a coffee-pot, Mr. Starbuck; he’s coming\noff to make us our coffee, is the Yarman; don’t you see that big tin can there\nalongside of him?—that’s his boiling water. Oh! he’s all right, is the Yarman.”\n\n“Go along with you,” cried Flask, “it’s a lamp-feeder and an oil-can. He’s out\nof oil, and has come a-begging.”\n\nHowever curious it may seem for an oil-ship to be borrowing oil on the\nwhale-ground, and however much it may invertedly contradict the old proverb\nabout carrying coals to Newcastle, yet sometimes such a thing really happens;\nand in the present case Captain Derick De Deer did indubitably conduct a\nlamp-feeder as Flask did declare.\n\nAs he mounted the deck, Ahab abruptly accosted him, without at all heeding what\nhe had in his hand; but in his broken lingo, the German soon evinced his\ncomplete ignorance of the White Whale; immediately turning the conversation to\nhis lamp-feeder and oil can, with some remarks touching his having to turn into\nhis hammock at night in profound darkness—his last drop of Bremen oil being\ngone, and not a single flying-fish yet captured to supply the deficiency;\nconcluding by hinting that his ship was indeed what in the Fishery is\ntechnically called a clean one (that is, an empty one), well deserving the name\nof Jungfrau or the Virgin.\n\nHis necessities supplied, Derick departed; but he had not gained his ship’s\nside, when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the mast-heads of both\nvessels; and so eager for the chase was Derick, that without pausing to put his\noil-can and lamp-feeder aboard, he slewed round his boat and made after the\nleviathan lamp-feeders.\n\nNow, the game having risen to leeward, he and the other three German boats that\nsoon followed him, had considerably the start of the Pequod’s keels. There were\neight whales, an average pod. Aware of their danger, they were going all abreast\nwith great speed straight before the wind, rubbing their flanks as closely as so\nmany spans of horses in harness. They left a great, wide wake, as though\ncontinually unrolling a great wide parchment upon the sea.\n\nFull in this rapid wake, and many fathoms in the rear, swam a huge, humped old\nbull, which by his comparatively slow progress, as well as by the unusual\nyellowish incrustations overgrowing him, seemed afflicted with the jaundice, or\nsome other infirmity. Whether this whale belonged to the pod in advance, seemed\nquestionable; for it is not customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all\nsocial. Nevertheless, he stuck to their wake, though indeed their back water\nmust have retarded him, because the white-bone or swell at his broad muzzle was\na dashed one, like the swell formed when two hostile currents meet. His spout\nwas short, slow, and laborious; coming forth with a choking sort of gush, and\nspending itself in torn shreds, followed by strange subterranean commotions in\nhim, which seemed to have egress at his other buried extremity, causing the\nwaters behind him to upbubble.\n\n“Who’s got some paregoric?” said Stubb, “he has the stomach-ache, I’m afraid.\nLord, think of having half an acre of stomach-ache! Adverse winds are holding\nmad Christmas in him, boys. It’s the first foul wind I ever knew to blow from\nastern; but look, did ever whale yaw so before? it must be, he’s lost his\ntiller.”\n\nAs an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan coast with a deck load of\nfrightened horses, careens, buries, rolls, and wallows on her way; so did this\nold whale heave his aged bulk, and now and then partly turning over on his\ncumbrous rib-ends, expose the cause of his devious wake in the unnatural stump\nof his starboard fin. Whether he had lost that fin in battle, or had been born\nwithout it, it were hard to say.\n\n“Only wait a bit, old chap, and I’ll give ye a sling for that wounded arm,”\ncried cruel Flask, pointing to the whale-line near him.\n\n“Mind he don’t sling thee with it,” cried Starbuck. “Give way, or the German\nwill have him.”\n\nWith one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this one fish,\nbecause not only was he the largest, and therefore the most valuable whale, but\nhe was nearest to them, and the other whales were going with such great\nvelocity, moreover, as almost to defy pursuit for the time. At this juncture the\nPequod’s keels had shot by the three German boats last lowered; but from the\ngreat start he had had, Derick’s boat still led the chase, though every moment\nneared by his foreign rivals. The only thing they feared, was, that from being\nalready so nigh to his mark, he would be enabled to dart his iron before they\ncould completely overtake and pass him. As for Derick, he seemed quite confident\nthat this would be the case, and occasionally with a deriding gesture shook his\nlamp-feeder at the other boats.\n\n“The ungracious and ungrateful dog!” cried Starbuck; “he mocks and dares me with\nthe very poor-box I filled for him not five minutes ago!”—then in his old\nintense whisper—“Give way, greyhounds! Dog to it!”\n\n“I tell ye what it is, men”—cried Stubb to his crew—“it’s against my religion to\nget mad; but I’d like to eat that villainous Yarman—Pull—won’t ye? Are ye going\nto let that rascal beat ye? Do ye love brandy? A hogshead of brandy, then, to\nthe best man. Come, why don’t some of ye burst a blood-vessel? Who’s that been\ndropping an anchor overboard—we don’t budge an inch—we’re becalmed. Halloo,\nhere’s grass growing in the boat’s bottom—and by the Lord, the mast there’s\nbudding. This won’t do, boys. Look at that Yarman! The short and long of it is,\nmen, will ye spit fire or not?”\n\n“Oh! see the suds he makes!” cried Flask, dancing up and down—“What a hump—Oh,\ndo pile on the beef—lays like a log! Oh! my lads, do spring—slap-jacks and\nquahogs for supper, you know, my lads—baked clams and muffins—oh, do, do,\nspring,—he’s a hundred barreller—don’t lose him now—don’t oh, don’t!—see that\nYarman—Oh, won’t ye pull for your duff, my lads—such a sog! such a sogger! Don’t\nye love sperm? There goes three thousand dollars, men!—a bank!—a whole bank! The\nbank of England!—Oh, do, do, do!—What’s that Yarman about now?”\n\nAt this moment Derick was in the act of pitching his lamp-feeder at the\nadvancing boats, and also his oil-can; perhaps with the double view of retarding\nhis rivals’ way, and at the same time economically accelerating his own by the\nmomentary impetus of the backward toss.\n\n“The unmannerly Dutch dogger!” cried Stubb. “Pull now, men, like fifty thousand\nline-of-battle-ship loads of red-haired devils. What d’ye say, Tashtego; are you\nthe man to snap your spine in two-and-twenty pieces for the honor of old\nGayhead? What d’ye say?”\n\n“I say, pull like god-dam,”—cried the Indian.\n\nFiercely, but evenly incited by the taunts of the German, the Pequod’s three\nboats now began ranging almost abreast; and, so disposed, momentarily neared\nhim. In that fine, loose, chivalrous attitude of the headsman when drawing near\nto his prey, the three mates stood up proudly, occasionally backing the after\noarsman with an exhilarating cry of, “There she slides, now! Hurrah for the\nwhite-ash breeze! Down with the Yarman! Sail over him!”\n\nBut so decided an original start had Derick had, that spite of all their\ngallantry, he would have proved the victor in this race, had not a righteous\njudgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the blade of his midship\noarsman. While this clumsy lubber was striving to free his white-ash, and while,\nin consequence, Derick’s boat was nigh to capsizing, and he thundering away at\nhis men in a mighty rage;—that was a good time for Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask.\nWith a shout, they took a mortal start forwards, and slantingly ranged up on the\nGerman’s quarter. An instant more, and all four boats were diagonically in the\nwhale’s immediate wake, while stretching from them, on both sides, was the\nfoaming swell that he made.\n\nIt was a terrific, most pitiable, and maddening sight. The whale was now going\nhead out, and sending his spout before him in a continual tormented jet; while\nhis one poor fin beat his side in an agony of fright. Now to this hand, now to\nthat, he yawed in his faltering flight, and still at every billow that he broke,\nhe spasmodically sank in the sea, or sideways rolled towards the sky his one\nbeating fin. So have I seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted broken\ncircles in the air, vainly striving to escape the piratical hawks. But the bird\nhas a voice, and with plaintive cries will make known her fear; but the fear of\nthis vast dumb brute of the sea, was chained up and enchanted in him; he had no\nvoice, save that choking respiration through his spiracle, and this made the\nsight of him unspeakably pitiable; while still, in his amazing bulk, portcullis\njaw, and omnipotent tail, there was enough to appal the stoutest man who so\npitied.\n\nSeeing now that but a very few moments more would give the Pequod’s boats the\nadvantage, and rather than be thus foiled of his game, Derick chose to hazard\nwhat to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart, ere the last chance\nwould for ever escape.\n\nBut no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke, than all three\ntigers—Queequeg, Tashtego, Daggoo—instinctively sprang to their feet, and\nstanding in a diagonal row, simultaneously pointed their barbs; and darted over\nthe head of the German harpooneer, their three Nantucket irons entered the\nwhale. Blinding vapors of foam and white-fire! The three boats, in the first\nfury of the whale’s headlong rush, bumped the German’s aside with such force,\nthat both Derick and his baffled harpooneer were spilled out, and sailed over by\nthe three flying keels.\n\n“Don’t be afraid, my butter-boxes,” cried Stubb, casting a passing glance upon\nthem as he shot by; “ye’ll be picked up presently—all right—I saw some sharks\nastern—St. Bernard’s dogs, you know—relieve distressed travellers. Hurrah! this\nis the way to sail now. Every keel a sunbeam! Hurrah!—Here we go like three tin\nkettles at the tail of a mad cougar! This puts me in mind of fastening to an\nelephant in a tilbury on a plain—makes the wheel-spokes fly, boys, when you\nfasten to him that way; and there’s danger of being pitched out too, when you\nstrike a hill. Hurrah! this is the way a fellow feels when he’s going to Davy\nJones—all a rush down an endless inclined plane! Hurrah! this whale carries the\neverlasting mail!”\n\nBut the monster’s run was a brief one. Giving a sudden gasp, he tumultuously\nsounded. With a grating rush, the three lines flew round the loggerheads with\nsuch a force as to gouge deep grooves in them; while so fearful were the\nharpooneers that this rapid sounding would soon exhaust the lines, that using\nall their dexterous might, they caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to\nhold on; till at last—owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead-lined\nchocks of the boats, whence the three ropes went straight down into the blue—the\ngunwales of the bows were almost even with the water, while the three sterns\ntilted high in the air. And the whale soon ceasing to sound, for some time they\nremained in that attitude, fearful of expending more line, though the position\nwas a little ticklish. But though boats have been taken down and lost in this\nway, yet it is this “holding on,” as it is called; this hooking up by the sharp\nbarbs of his live flesh from the back; this it is that often torments the\nLeviathan into soon rising again to meet the sharp lance of his foes. Yet not to\nspeak of the peril of the thing, it is to be doubted whether this course is\nalways the best; for it is but reasonable to presume, that the longer the\nstricken whale stays under water, the more he is exhausted. Because, owing to\nthe enormous surface of him—in a full grown sperm whale something less than 2000\nsquare feet—the pressure of the water is immense. We all know what an\nastonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under; even here,\nabove-ground, in the air; how vast, then, the burden of a whale, bearing on his\nback a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean! It must at least equal the weight\nof fifty atmospheres. One whaleman has estimated it at the weight of twenty\nline-of-battle ships, with all their guns, and stores, and men on board.\n\nAs the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea, gazing down into its\neternal blue noon; and as not a single groan or cry of any sort, nay, not so\nmuch as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths; what landsman would have\nthought, that beneath all that silence and placidity, the utmost monster of the\nseas was writhing and wrenching in agony! Not eight inches of perpendicular rope\nwere visible at the bows. Seems it credible that by three such thin threads the\ngreat Leviathan was suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock.\nSuspended? and to what? To three bits of board. Is this the creature of whom it\nwas once so triumphantly said—“Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or\nhis head with fish-spears? The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold, the\nspear, the dart, nor the habergeon: he esteemeth iron as straw; the arrow cannot\nmake him flee; darts are counted as stubble; he laugheth at the shaking of a\nspear!” This the creature? this he? Oh! that unfulfilments should follow the\nprophets. For with the strength of a thousand thighs in his tail, Leviathan had\nrun his head under the mountains of the sea, to hide him from the Pequod’s\nfish-spears!\n\nIn that sloping afternoon sunlight, the shadows that the three boats sent down\nbeneath the surface, must have been long enough and broad enough to shade half\nXerxes’ army. Who can tell how appalling to the wounded whale must have been\nsuch huge phantoms flitting over his head!\n\n“Stand by, men; he stirs,” cried Starbuck, as the three lines suddenly vibrated\nin the water, distinctly conducting upwards to them, as by magnetic wires, the\nlife and death throbs of the whale, so that every oarsman felt them in his seat.\nThe next moment, relieved in great part from the downward strain at the bows,\nthe boats gave a sudden bounce upwards, as a small icefield will, when a dense\nherd of white bears are scared from it into the sea.\n\n“Haul in! Haul in!” cried Starbuck again; “he’s rising.”\n\nThe lines, of which, hardly an instant before, not one hand’s breadth could have\nbeen gained, were now in long quick coils flung back all dripping into the\nboats, and soon the whale broke water within two ship’s lengths of the hunters.\n\nHis motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion. In most land animals there\nare certain valves or flood-gates in many of their veins, whereby when wounded,\nthe blood is in some degree at least instantly shut off in certain directions.\nNot so with the whale; one of whose peculiarities it is to have an entire\nnon-valvular structure of the blood-vessels, so that when pierced even by so\nsmall a point as a harpoon, a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole\narterial system; and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of\nwater at a great distance below the surface, his life may be said to pour from\nhim in incessant streams. Yet so vast is the quantity of blood in him, and so\ndistant and numerous its interior fountains, that he will keep thus bleeding and\nbleeding for a considerable period; even as in a drought a river will flow,\nwhose source is in the well-springs of far-off and undiscernible hills. Even\nnow, when the boats pulled upon this whale, and perilously drew over his swaying\nflukes, and the lances were darted into him, they were followed by steady jets\nfrom the new made wound, which kept continually playing, while the natural\nspout-hole in his head was only at intervals, however rapid, sending its\naffrighted moisture into the air. From this last vent no blood yet came, because\nno vital part of him had thus far been struck. His life, as they significantly\ncall it, was untouched.\n\nAs the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of his form,\nwith much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was plainly revealed. His eyes, or\nrather the places where his eyes had been, were beheld. As strange misgrown\nmasses gather in the knot-holes of the noblest oaks when prostrate, so from the\npoints which the whale’s eyes had once occupied, now protruded blind bulbs,\nhorribly pitiable to see. But pity there was none. For all his old age, and his\none arm, and his blind eyes, he must die the death and be murdered, in order to\nlight the gay bridals and other merry-makings of men, and also to illuminate the\nsolemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all. Still\nrolling in his blood, at last he partially disclosed a strangely discoloured\nbunch or protuberance, the size of a bushel, low down on the flank.\n\n“A nice spot,” cried Flask; “just let me prick him there once.”\n\n“Avast!” cried Starbuck, “there’s no need of that!”\n\nBut humane Starbuck was too late. At the instant of the dart an ulcerous jet\nshot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more than sufferable anguish,\nthe whale now spouting thick blood, with swift fury blindly darted at the craft,\nbespattering them and their glorying crews all over with showers of gore,\ncapsizing Flask’s boat and marring the bows. It was his death stroke. For, by\nthis time, so spent was he by loss of blood, that he helplessly rolled away from\nthe wreck he had made; lay panting on his side, impotently flapped with his\nstumped fin, then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world; turned up\nthe white secrets of his belly; lay like a log, and died. It was most piteous,\nthat last expiring spout. As when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn\noff from some mighty fountain, and with half-stifled melancholy gurglings the\nspray-column lowers and lowers to the ground—so the last long dying spout of the\nwhale.\n\nSoon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship, the body showed\nsymptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled. Immediately, by Starbuck’s\norders, lines were secured to it at different points, so that ere long every\nboat was a buoy; the sunken whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by\nthe cords. By very heedful management, when the ship drew nigh, the whale was\ntransferred to her side, and was strongly secured there by the stiffest\nfluke-chains, for it was plain that unless artificially upheld, the body would\nat once sink to the bottom.\n\nIt so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade, the entire\nlength of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his flesh, on the lower part\nof the bunch before described. But as the stumps of harpoons are frequently\nfound in the dead bodies of captured whales, with the flesh perfectly healed\naround them, and no prominence of any kind to denote their place; therefore,\nthere must needs have been some other unknown reason in the present case fully\nto account for the ulceration alluded to. But still more curious was the fact of\na lance-head of stone being found in him, not far from the buried iron, the\nflesh perfectly firm about it. Who had darted that stone lance? And when? It\nmight have been darted by some Nor’ West Indian long before America was\ndiscovered.\n\nWhat other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous cabinet there\nis no telling. But a sudden stop was put to further discoveries, by the ship’s\nbeing unprecedentedly dragged over sideways to the sea, owing to the body’s\nimmensely increasing tendency to sink. However, Starbuck, who had the ordering\nof affairs, hung on to it to the last; hung on to it so resolutely, indeed, that\nwhen at length the ship would have been capsized, if still persisting in locking\narms with the body; then, when the command was given to break clear from it,\nsuch was the immovable strain upon the timber-heads to which the fluke-chains\nand cables were fastened, that it was impossible to cast them off. Meantime\neverything in the Pequod was aslant. To cross to the other side of the deck was\nlike walking up the steep gabled roof of a house. The ship groaned and gasped.\nMany of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and cabins were started from their\nplaces, by the unnatural dislocation. In vain handspikes and crows were brought\nto bear upon the immovable fluke-chains, to pry them adrift from the\ntimberheads; and so low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could\nnot be at all approached, while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed\nadded to the sinking bulk, and the ship seemed on the point of going over.\n\n“Hold on, hold on, won’t ye?” cried Stubb to the body, “don’t be in such a devil\nof a hurry to sink! By thunder, men, we must do something or go for it. No use\nprying there; avast, I say with your handspikes, and run one of ye for a prayer\nbook and a pen-knife, and cut the big chains.”\n\n“Knife? Aye, aye,” cried Queequeg, and seizing the carpenter’s heavy hatchet, he\nleaned out of a porthole, and steel to iron, began slashing at the largest\nfluke-chains. But a few strokes, full of sparks, were given, when the exceeding\nstrain effected the rest. With a terrific snap, every fastening went adrift; the\nship righted, the carcase sank.\n\nNow, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm Whale is a\nvery curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet adequately accounted for it.\nUsually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great buoyancy, with its side or belly\nconsiderably elevated above the surface. If the only whales that thus sank were\nold, meagre, and broken-hearted creatures, their pads of lard diminished and all\ntheir bones heavy and rheumatic; then you might with some reason assert that\nthis sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so sinking,\nconsequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him. But it is not so. For\nyoung whales, in the highest health, and swelling with noble aspirations,\nprematurely cut off in the warm flush and May of life, with all their panting\nlard about them; even these brawny, buoyant heroes do sometimes sink.\n\nBe it said, however, that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this accident\nthan any other species. Where one of that sort go down, twenty Right Whales do.\nThis difference in the species is no doubt imputable in no small degree to the\ngreater quantity of bone in the Right Whale; his Venetian blinds alone sometimes\nweighing more than a ton; from this incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free.\nBut there are instances where, after the lapse of many hours or several days,\nthe sunken whale again rises, more buoyant than in life. But the reason of this\nis obvious. Gases are generated in him; he swells to a prodigious magnitude;\nbecomes a sort of animal balloon. A line-of-battle ship could hardly keep him\nunder then. In the Shore Whaling, on soundings, among the Bays of New Zealand,\nwhen a Right Whale gives token of sinking, they fasten buoys to him, with plenty\nof rope; so that when the body has gone down, they know where to look for it\nwhen it shall have ascended again.\n\nIt was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from the\nPequod’s mast-heads, announcing that the Jungfrau was again lowering her boats;\nthough the only spout in sight was that of a Fin-Back, belonging to the species\nof uncapturable whales, because of its incredible power of swimming.\nNevertheless, the Fin-Back’s spout is so similar to the Sperm Whale’s, that by\nunskilful fishermen it is often mistaken for it. And consequently Derick and all\nhis host were now in valiant chase of this unnearable brute. The Virgin crowding\nall sail, made after her four young keels, and thus they all disappeared far to\nleeward, still in bold, hopeful chase.\n\nOh! many are the Fin-Backs, and many are the Dericks, my friend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 82. THE HONOR AND GLORY OF WHALING.\n\nThere are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the true method.\n\nThe more I dive into this matter of whaling, and push my researches up to the\nvery spring-head of it so much the more am I impressed with its great\nhonorableness and antiquity; and especially when I find so many great demi-gods\nand heroes, prophets of all sorts, who one way or other have shed distinction\nupon it, I am transported with the reflection that I myself belong, though but\nsubordinately, to so emblazoned a fraternity.\n\nThe gallant Perseus, a son of Jupiter, was the first whaleman; and to the\neternal honor of our calling be it said, that the first whale attacked by our\nbrotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent. Those were the knightly days\nof our profession, when we only bore arms to succor the distressed, and not to\nfill men’s lamp-feeders. Every one knows the fine story of Perseus and\nAndromeda; how the lovely Andromeda, the daughter of a king, was tied to a rock\non the sea-coast, and as Leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off,\nPerseus, the prince of whalemen, intrepidly advancing, harpooned the monster,\nand delivered and married the maid. It was an admirable artistic exploit, rarely\nachieved by the best harpooneers of the present day; inasmuch as this Leviathan\nwas slain at the very first dart. And let no man doubt this Arkite story; for in\nthe ancient Joppa, now Jaffa, on the Syrian coast, in one of the Pagan temples,\nthere stood for many ages the vast skeleton of a whale, which the city’s legends\nand all the inhabitants asserted to be the identical bones of the monster that\nPerseus slew. When the Romans took Joppa, the same skeleton was carried to Italy\nin triumph. What seems most singular and suggestively important in this story,\nis this: it was from Joppa that Jonah set sail.\n\nAkin to the adventure of Perseus and Andromeda—indeed, by some supposed to be\nindirectly derived from it—is that famous story of St. George and the Dragon;\nwhich dragon I maintain to have been a whale; for in many old chronicles whales\nand dragons are strangely jumbled together, and often stand for each other.\n“Thou art as a lion of the waters, and as a dragon of the sea,” saith Ezekiel;\nhereby, plainly meaning a whale; in truth, some versions of the Bible use that\nword itself. Besides, it would much subtract from the glory of the exploit had\nSt. George but encountered a crawling reptile of the land, instead of doing\nbattle with the great monster of the deep. Any man may kill a snake, but only a\nPerseus, a St. George, a Coffin, have the heart in them to march boldly up to a\nwhale.\n\nLet not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us; for though the creature\nencountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely represented of a\ngriffin-like shape, and though the battle is depicted on land and the saint on\nhorseback, yet considering the great ignorance of those times, when the true\nform of the whale was unknown to artists; and considering that as in Perseus’\ncase, St. George’s whale might have crawled up out of the sea on the beach; and\nconsidering that the animal ridden by St. George might have been only a large\nseal, or sea-horse; bearing all this in mind, it will not appear altogether\nincompatible with the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene, to\nhold this so-called dragon no other than the great Leviathan himself. In fact,\nplaced before the strict and piercing truth, this whole story will fare like\nthat fish, flesh, and fowl idol of the Philistines, Dagon by name; who being\nplanted before the ark of Israel, his horse’s head and both the palms of his\nhands fell off from him, and only the stump or fishy part of him remained. Thus,\nthen, one of our own noble stamp, even a whaleman, is the tutelary guardian of\nEngland; and by good rights, we harpooneers of Nantucket should be enrolled in\nthe most noble order of St. George. And therefore, let not the knights of that\nhonorable company (none of whom, I venture to say, have ever had to do with a\nwhale like their great patron), let them never eye a Nantucketer with disdain,\nsince even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we are much better entitled\nto St. George’s decoration than they.\n\nWhether to admit Hercules among us or not, concerning this I long remained\ndubious: for though according to the Greek mythologies, that antique Crockett\nand Kit Carson—that brawny doer of rejoicing good deeds, was swallowed down and\nthrown up by a whale; still, whether that strictly makes a whaleman of him, that\nmight be mooted. It nowhere appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish,\nunless, indeed, from the inside. Nevertheless, he may be deemed a sort of\ninvoluntary whaleman; at any rate the whale caught him, if he did not the whale.\nI claim him for one of our clan.\n\nBut, by the best contradictory authorities, this Grecian story of Hercules and\nthe whale is considered to be derived from the still more ancient Hebrew story\nof Jonah and the whale; and vice versâ; certainly they are very similar. If I\nclaim the demi-god then, why not the prophet?\n\nNor do heroes, saints, demigods, and prophets alone comprise the whole roll of\nour order. Our grand master is still to be named; for like royal kings of old\ntimes, we find the head waters of our fraternity in nothing short of the great\ngods themselves. That wondrous oriental story is now to be rehearsed from the\nShaster, which gives us the dread Vishnoo, one of the three persons in the\ngodhead of the Hindoos; gives us this divine Vishnoo himself for our\nLord;—Vishnoo, who, by the first of his ten earthly incarnations, has for ever\nset apart and sanctified the whale. When Brahma, or the God of Gods, saith the\nShaster, resolved to recreate the world after one of its periodical\ndissolutions, he gave birth to Vishnoo, to preside over the work; but the Vedas,\nor mystical books, whose perusal would seem to have been indispensable to\nVishnoo before beginning the creation, and which therefore must have contained\nsomething in the shape of practical hints to young architects, these Vedas were\nlying at the bottom of the waters; so Vishnoo became incarnate in a whale, and\nsounding down in him to the uttermost depths, rescued the sacred volumes. Was\nnot this Vishnoo a whaleman, then? even as a man who rides a horse is called a\nhorseman?\n\nPerseus, St. George, Hercules, Jonah, and Vishnoo! there’s a member-roll for\nyou! What club but the whaleman’s can head off like that?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 83. JONAH HISTORICALLY REGARDED.\n\nReference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the whale in the\npreceding chapter. Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this historical story\nof Jonah and the whale. But then there were some sceptical Greeks and Romans,\nwho, standing out from the orthodox pagans of their times, equally doubted the\nstory of Hercules and the whale, and Arion and the dolphin; and yet their\ndoubting those traditions did not make those traditions one whit the less facts,\nfor all that.\n\nOne old Sag-Harbor whaleman’s chief reason for questioning the Hebrew story was\nthis:—He had one of those quaint old-fashioned Bibles, embellished with curious,\nunscientific plates; one of which represented Jonah’s whale with two spouts in\nhis head—a peculiarity only true with respect to a species of the Leviathan (the\nRight Whale, and the varieties of that order), concerning which the fishermen\nhave this saying, “A penny roll would choke him”; his swallow is so very small.\nBut, to this, Bishop Jebb’s anticipative answer is ready. It is not necessary,\nhints the Bishop, that we consider Jonah as tombed in the whale’s belly, but as\ntemporarily lodged in some part of his mouth. And this seems reasonable enough\nin the good Bishop. For truly, the Right Whale’s mouth would accommodate a\ncouple of whist-tables, and comfortably seat all the players. Possibly, too,\nJonah might have ensconced himself in a hollow tooth; but, on second thoughts,\nthe Right Whale is toothless.\n\nAnother reason which Sag-Harbor (he went by that name) urged for his want of\nfaith in this matter of the prophet, was something obscurely in reference to his\nincarcerated body and the whale’s gastric juices. But this objection likewise\nfalls to the ground, because a German exegetist supposes that Jonah must have\ntaken refuge in the floating body of a dead whale—even as the French soldiers in\nthe Russian campaign turned their dead horses into tents, and crawled into them.\nBesides, it has been divined by other continental commentators, that when Jonah\nwas thrown overboard from the Joppa ship, he straightway effected his escape to\nanother vessel near by, some vessel with a whale for a figure-head; and, I would\nadd, possibly called “The Whale,” as some craft are nowadays christened the\n“Shark,” the “Gull,” the “Eagle.” Nor have there been wanting learned exegetists\nwho have opined that the whale mentioned in the book of Jonah merely meant a\nlife-preserver—an inflated bag of wind—which the endangered prophet swam to, and\nso was saved from a watery doom. Poor Sag-Harbor, therefore, seems worsted all\nround. But he had still another reason for his want of faith. It was this, if I\nremember right: Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the Mediterranean Sea, and\nafter three days he was vomited up somewhere within three days’ journey of\nNineveh, a city on the Tigris, very much more than three days’ journey across\nfrom the nearest point of the Mediterranean coast. How is that?\n\nBut was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that short\ndistance of Nineveh? Yes. He might have carried him round by the way of the Cape\nof Good Hope. But not to speak of the passage through the whole length of the\nMediterranean, and another passage up the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, such a\nsupposition would involve the complete circumnavigation of all Africa in three\ndays, not to speak of the Tigris waters, near the site of Nineveh, being too\nshallow for any whale to swim in. Besides, this idea of Jonah’s weathering the\nCape of Good Hope at so early a day would wrest the honor of the discovery of\nthat great headland from Bartholomew Diaz, its reputed discoverer, and so make\nmodern history a liar.\n\nBut all these foolish arguments of old Sag-Harbor only evinced his foolish pride\nof reason—a thing still more reprehensible in him, seeing that he had but little\nlearning except what he had picked up from the sun and the sea. I say it only\nshows his foolish, impious pride, and abominable, devilish rebellion against the\nreverend clergy. For by a Portuguese Catholic priest, this very idea of Jonah’s\ngoing to Nineveh via the Cape of Good Hope was advanced as a signal\nmagnification of the general miracle. And so it was. Besides, to this day, the\nhighly enlightened Turks devoutly believe in the historical story of Jonah. And\nsome three centuries ago, an English traveller in old Harris’s Voyages, speaks\nof a Turkish Mosque built in honor of Jonah, in which Mosque was a miraculous\nlamp that burnt without any oil.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 84. PITCHPOLING.\n\nTo make them run easily and swiftly, the axles of carriages are anointed; and\nfor much the same purpose, some whalers perform an analogous operation upon\ntheir boat; they grease the bottom. Nor is it to be doubted that as such a\nprocedure can do no harm, it may possibly be of no contemptible advantage;\nconsidering that oil and water are hostile; that oil is a sliding thing, and\nthat the object in view is to make the boat slide bravely. Queequeg believed\nstrongly in anointing his boat, and one morning not long after the German ship\nJungfrau disappeared, took more than customary pains in that occupation;\ncrawling under its bottom, where it hung over the side, and rubbing in the\nunctuousness as though diligently seeking to insure a crop of hair from the\ncraft’s bald keel. He seemed to be working in obedience to some particular\npresentiment. Nor did it remain unwarranted by the event.\n\nTowards noon whales were raised; but so soon as the ship sailed down to them,\nthey turned and fled with swift precipitancy; a disordered flight, as of\nCleopatra’s barges from Actium.\n\nNevertheless, the boats pursued, and Stubb’s was foremost. By great exertion,\nTashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron; but the stricken whale, without\nat all sounding, still continued his horizontal flight, with added fleetness.\nSuch unintermitted strainings upon the planted iron must sooner or later\ninevitably extract it. It became imperative to lance the flying whale, or be\ncontent to lose him. But to haul the boat up to his flank was impossible, he\nswam so fast and furious. What then remained?\n\nOf all the wondrous devices and dexterities, the sleights of hand and countless\nsubtleties, to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced, none exceed that\nfine manœuvre with the lance called pitchpoling. Small sword, or broad sword, in\nall its exercises boasts nothing like it. It is only indispensable with an\ninveterate running whale; its grand fact and feature is the wonderful distance\nto which the long lance is accurately darted from a violently rocking, jerking\nboat, under extreme headway. Steel and wood included, the entire spear is some\nten or twelve feet in length; the staff is much slighter than that of the\nharpoon, and also of a lighter material—pine. It is furnished with a small rope\ncalled a warp, of considerable length, by which it can be hauled back to the\nhand after darting.\n\nBut before going further, it is important to mention here, that though the\nharpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance, yet it is seldom done;\nand when done, is still less frequently successful, on account of the greater\nweight and inferior length of the harpoon as compared with the lance, which in\neffect become serious drawbacks. As a general thing, therefore, you must first\nget fast to a whale, before any pitchpoling comes into play.\n\nLook now at Stubb; a man who from his humorous, deliberate coolness and\nequanimity in the direst emergencies, was specially qualified to excel in\npitchpoling. Look at him; he stands upright in the tossed bow of the flying\nboat; wrapt in fleecy foam, the towing whale is forty feet ahead. Handling the\nlong lance lightly, glancing twice or thrice along its length to see if it be\nexactly straight, Stubb whistlingly gathers up the coil of the warp in one hand,\nso as to secure its free end in his grasp, leaving the rest unobstructed. Then\nholding the lance full before his waistband’s middle, he levels it at the whale;\nwhen, covering him with it, he steadily depresses the butt-end in his hand,\nthereby elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon his\npalm, fifteen feet in the air. He minds you somewhat of a juggler, balancing a\nlong staff on his chin. Next moment with a rapid, nameless impulse, in a superb\nlofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming distance, and quivers in the life\nspot of the whale. Instead of sparkling water, he now spouts red blood.\n\n“That drove the spigot out of him!” cried Stubb. “’Tis July’s immortal Fourth;\nall fountains must run wine today! Would now, it were old Orleans whiskey, or\nold Ohio, or unspeakable old Monongahela! Then, Tashtego, lad, I’d have ye hold\na canakin to the jet, and we’d drink round it! Yea, verily, hearts alive, we’d\nbrew choice punch in the spread of his spout-hole there, and from that live\npunch-bowl quaff the living stuff.”\n\nAgain and again to such gamesome talk, the dexterous dart is repeated, the spear\nreturning to its master like a greyhound held in skilful leash. The agonized\nwhale goes into his flurry; the tow-line is slackened, and the pitchpoler\ndropping astern, folds his hands, and mutely watches the monster die.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 85. THE FOUNTAIN.\n\nThat for six thousand years—and no one knows how many millions of ages\nbefore—the great whales should have been spouting all over the sea, and\nsprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep, as with so many sprinkling or\nmistifying pots; and that for some centuries back, thousands of hunters should\nhave been close by the fountain of the whale, watching these sprinklings and\nspoutings—that all this should be, and yet, that down to this blessed minute\n(fifteen and a quarter minutes past one o’clock P.M. of this sixteenth day of\nDecember, A.D. 1851), it should still remain a problem, whether these spoutings\nare, after all, really water, or nothing but vapor—this is surely a noteworthy\nthing.\n\nLet us, then, look at this matter, along with some interesting items contingent.\nEvery one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their gills, the finny tribes in\ngeneral breathe the air which at all times is combined with the element in which\nthey swim; hence, a herring or a cod might live a century, and never once raise\nits head above the surface. But owing to his marked internal structure which\ngives him regular lungs, like a human being’s, the whale can only live by\ninhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere. Wherefore the necessity for\nhis periodical visits to the upper world. But he cannot in any degree breathe\nthrough his mouth, for, in his ordinary attitude, the Sperm Whale’s mouth is\nburied at least eight feet beneath the surface; and what is still more, his\nwindpipe has no connexion with his mouth. No, he breathes through his spiracle\nalone; and this is on the top of his head.\n\nIf I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function indispensable to\nvitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a certain element, which being\nsubsequently brought into contact with the blood imparts to the blood its\nvivifying principle, I do not think I shall err; though I may possibly use some\nsuperfluous scientific words. Assume it, and it follows that if all the blood in\na man could be aerated with one breath, he might then seal up his nostrils and\nnot fetch another for a considerable time. That is to say, he would then live\nwithout breathing. Anomalous as it may seem, this is precisely the case with the\nwhale, who systematically lives, by intervals, his full hour and more (when at\nthe bottom) without drawing a single breath, or so much as in any way inhaling a\nparticle of air; for, remember, he has no gills. How is this? Between his ribs\nand on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable involved Cretan\nlabyrinth of vermicelli-like vessels, which vessels, when he quits the surface,\nare completely distended with oxygenated blood. So that for an hour or more, a\nthousand fathoms in the sea, he carries a surplus stock of vitality in him, just\nas the camel crossing the waterless desert carries a surplus supply of drink for\nfuture use in its four supplementary stomachs. The anatomical fact of this\nlabyrinth is indisputable; and that the supposition founded upon it is\nreasonable and true, seems the more cogent to me, when I consider the otherwise\ninexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in having his spoutings out, as the\nfishermen phrase it. This is what I mean. If unmolested, upon rising to the\nsurface, the Sperm Whale will continue there for a period of time exactly\nuniform with all his other unmolested risings. Say he stays eleven minutes, and\njets seventy times, that is, respires seventy breaths; then whenever he rises\nagain, he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over again, to a minute. Now,\nif after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him, so that he sounds, he will be\nalways dodging up again to make good his regular allowance of air. And not till\nthose seventy breaths are told, will he finally go down to stay out his full\nterm below. Remark, however, that in different individuals these rates are\ndifferent; but in any one they are alike. Now, why should the whale thus insist\nupon having his spoutings out, unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air,\nere descending for good? How obvious is it, too, that this necessity for the\nwhale’s rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase. For not by\nhook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught, when sailing a thousand\nfathoms beneath the sunlight. Not so much thy skill, then, O hunter, as the\ngreat necessities that strike the victory to thee!\n\nIn man, breathing is incessantly going on—one breath only serving for two or\nthree pulsations; so that whatever other business he has to attend to, waking or\nsleeping, breathe he must, or die he will. But the Sperm Whale only breathes\nabout one seventh or Sunday of his time.\n\nIt has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole; if it\ncould truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water, then I opine we\nshould be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell seems obliterated in\nhim; for the only thing about him that at all answers to his nose is that\nidentical spout-hole; and being so clogged with two elements, it could not be\nexpected to have the power of smelling. But owing to the mystery of the\nspout—whether it be water or whether it be vapor—no absolute certainty can as\nyet be arrived at on this head. Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm Whale\nhas no proper olfactories. But what does he want of them? No roses, no violets,\nno Cologne-water in the sea.\n\nFurthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting canal,\nand as that long canal—like the grand Erie Canal—is furnished with a sort of\nlocks (that open and shut) for the downward retention of air or the upward\nexclusion of water, therefore the whale has no voice; unless you insult him by\nsaying, that when he so strangely rumbles, he talks through his nose. But then\nagain, what has the whale to say? Seldom have I known any profound being that\nhad anything to say to this world, unless forced to stammer out something by way\nof getting a living. Oh! happy that the world is such an excellent listener!\n\nNow, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it is for the\nconveyance of air, and for several feet laid along, horizontally, just beneath\nthe upper surface of his head, and a little to one side; this curious canal is\nvery much like a gas-pipe laid down in a city on one side of a street. But the\nquestion returns whether this gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words,\nwhether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the mere vapor of the exhaled breath, or\nwhether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth, and\ndischarged through the spiracle. It is certain that the mouth indirectly\ncommunicates with the spouting canal; but it cannot be proved that this is for\nthe purpose of discharging water through the spiracle. Because the greatest\nnecessity for so doing would seem to be, when in feeding he accidentally takes\nin water. But the Sperm Whale’s food is far beneath the surface, and there he\ncannot spout even if he would. Besides, if you regard him very closely, and time\nhim with your watch, you will find that when unmolested, there is an undeviating\nrhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of respiration.\n\nBut why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject? Speak out! You have\nseen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can you not tell water from air?\nMy dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to settle these plain things. I\nhave ever found your plain things the knottiest of all. And as for this whale\nspout, you might almost stand in it, and yet be undecided as to what it is\nprecisely.\n\nThe central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping it; and\nhow can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it, when, always, when\nyou are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his spout, he is in a\nprodigious commotion, the water cascading all around him. And if at such times\nyou should think that you really perceived drops of moisture in the spout, how\ndo you know that they are not merely condensed from its vapor; or how do you\nknow that they are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the\nspout-hole fissure, which is countersunk into the summit of the whale’s head?\nFor even when tranquilly swimming through the mid-day sea in a calm, with his\nelevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary’s in the desert; even then, the whale\nalways carries a small basin of water on his head, as under a blazing sun you\nwill sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with rain.\n\nNor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the precise\nnature of the whale spout. It will not do for him to be peering into it, and\nputting his face in it. You cannot go with your pitcher to this fountain and\nfill it, and bring it away. For even when coming into slight contact with the\nouter, vapory shreds of the jet, which will often happen, your skin will\nfeverishly smart, from the acridness of the thing so touching it. And I know\none, who coming into still closer contact with the spout, whether with some\nscientific object in view, or otherwise, I cannot say, the skin peeled off from\nhis cheek and arm. Wherefore, among whalemen, the spout is deemed poisonous;\nthey try to evade it. Another thing; I have heard it said, and I do not much\ndoubt it, that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind you.\nThe wisest thing the investigator can do then, it seems to me, is to let this\ndeadly spout alone.\n\nStill, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and establish. My hypothesis\nis this: that the spout is nothing but mist. And besides other reasons, to this\nconclusion I am impelled, by considerations touching the great inherent dignity\nand sublimity of the Sperm Whale; I account him no common, shallow being,\ninasmuch as it is an undisputed fact that he is never found on soundings, or\nnear shores; all other whales sometimes are. He is both ponderous and profound.\nAnd I am convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings, such as\nPlato, Pyrrho, the Devil, Jupiter, Dante, and so on, there always goes up a\ncertain semi-visible steam, while in the act of thinking deep thoughts. While\ncomposing a little treatise on Eternity, I had the curiosity to place a mirror\nbefore me; and ere long saw reflected there, a curious involved worming and\nundulation in the atmosphere over my head. The invariable moisture of my hair,\nwhile plunged in deep thought, after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled\nattic, of an August noon; this seems an additional argument for the above\nsupposition.\n\nAnd how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster, to behold him\nsolemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea; his vast, mild head overhung by a\ncanopy of vapor, engendered by his incommunicable contemplations, and that\nvapor—as you will sometimes see it—glorified by a rainbow, as if Heaven itself\nhad put its seal upon his thoughts. For, d’ye see, rainbows do not visit the\nclear air; they only irradiate vapor. And so, through all the thick mists of the\ndim doubts in my mind, divine intuitions now and then shoot, enkindling my fog\nwith a heavenly ray. And for this I thank God; for all have doubts; many deny;\nbut doubts or denials, few along with them, have intuitions. Doubts of all\nthings earthly, and intuitions of some things heavenly; this combination makes\nneither believer nor infidel, but makes a man who regards them both with equal\neye.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 86. THE TAIL.\n\nOther poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope, and the\nlovely plumage of the bird that never alights; less celestial, I celebrate a\ntail.\n\nReckoning the largest sized Sperm Whale’s tail to begin at that point of the\ntrunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man, it comprises upon its upper\nsurface alone, an area of at least fifty square feet. The compact round body of\nits root expands into two broad, firm, flat palms or flukes, gradually shoaling\naway to less than an inch in thickness. At the crotch or junction, these flukes\nslightly overlap, then sideways recede from each other like wings, leaving a\nwide vacancy between. In no living thing are the lines of beauty more\nexquisitely defined than in the crescentic borders of these flukes. At its\nutmost expansion in the full grown whale, the tail will considerably exceed\ntwenty feet across.\n\nThe entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews; but cut into it,\nand you find that three distinct strata compose it:—upper, middle, and lower.\nThe fibres in the upper and lower layers, are long and horizontal; those of the\nmiddle one, very short, and running crosswise between the outside layers. This\ntriune structure, as much as anything else, imparts power to the tail. To the\nstudent of old Roman walls, the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to\nthe thin course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those wonderful\nrelics of the antique, and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the great\nstrength of the masonry.\n\nBut as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough, the whole\nbulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of muscular fibres and\nfilaments, which passing on either side the loins and running down into the\nflukes, insensibly blend with them, and largely contribute to their might; so\nthat in the tail the confluent measureless force of the whole whale seems\nconcentrated to a point. Could annihilation occur to matter, this were the thing\nto do it.\n\nNor does this—its amazing strength, at all tend to cripple the graceful flexion\nof its motions; where infantileness of ease undulates through a Titanism of\npower. On the contrary, those motions derive their most appalling beauty from\nit. Real strength never impairs beauty or harmony, but it often bestows it; and\nin everything imposingly beautiful, strength has much to do with the magic. Take\naway the tied tendons that all over seem bursting from the marble in the carved\nHercules, and its charm would be gone. As devout Eckerman lifted the linen sheet\nfrom the naked corpse of Goethe, he was overwhelmed with the massive chest of\nthe man, that seemed as a Roman triumphal arch. When Angelo paints even God the\nFather in human form, mark what robustness is there. And whatever they may\nreveal of the divine love in the Son, the soft, curled, hermaphroditical Italian\npictures, in which his idea has been most successfully embodied; these pictures,\nso destitute as they are of all brawniness, hint nothing of any power, but the\nmere negative, feminine one of submission and endurance, which on all hands it\nis conceded, form the peculiar practical virtues of his teachings.\n\nSuch is the subtle elasticity of the organ I treat of, that whether wielded in\nsport, or in earnest, or in anger, whatever be the mood it be in, its flexions\nare invariably marked by exceeding grace. Therein no fairy’s arm can transcend\nit.\n\nFive great motions are peculiar to it. First, when used as a fin for\nprogression; Second, when used as a mace in battle; Third, in sweeping; Fourth,\nin lobtailing; Fifth, in peaking flukes.\n\nFirst: Being horizontal in its position, the Leviathan’s tail acts in a\ndifferent manner from the tails of all other sea creatures. It never wriggles.\nIn man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority. To the whale, his tail is\nthe sole means of propulsion. Scroll-wise coiled forwards beneath the body, and\nthen rapidly sprung backwards, it is this which gives that singular darting,\nleaping motion to the monster when furiously swimming. His side-fins only serve\nto steer by.\n\nSecond: It is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only fights\nanother sperm whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in his conflicts with\nman, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail. In striking at a boat, he\nswiftly curves away his flukes from it, and the blow is only inflicted by the\nrecoil. If it be made in the unobstructed air, especially if it descend to its\nmark, the stroke is then simply irresistible. No ribs of man or boat can\nwithstand it. Your only salvation lies in eluding it; but if it comes sideways\nthrough the opposing water, then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the\nwhale-boat, and the elasticity of its materials, a cracked rib or a dashed plank\nor two, a sort of stitch in the side, is generally the most serious result.\nThese submerged side blows are so often received in the fishery, that they are\naccounted mere child’s play. Some one strips off a frock, and the hole is\nstopped.\n\nThird: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in the whale the sense\nof touch is concentrated in the tail; for in this respect there is a delicacy in\nit only equalled by the daintiness of the elephant’s trunk. This delicacy is\nchiefly evinced in the action of sweeping, when in maidenly gentleness the whale\nwith a certain soft slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the\nsurface of the sea; and if he feel but a sailor’s whisker, woe to that sailor,\nwhiskers and all. What tenderness there is in that preliminary touch! Had this\ntail any prehensile power, I should straightway bethink me of Darmonodes’\nelephant that so frequented the flower-market, and with low salutations\npresented nosegays to damsels, and then caressed their zones. On more accounts\nthan one, a pity it is that the whale does not possess this prehensile virtue in\nhis tail; for I have heard of yet another elephant, that when wounded in the\nfight, curved round his trunk and extracted the dart.\n\nFourth: Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the middle\nof solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast corpulence of his dignity,\nand kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as if it were a hearth. But still you see\nhis power in his play. The broad palms of his tail are flirted high into the\nair; then smiting the surface, the thunderous concussion resounds for miles. You\nwould almost think a great gun had been discharged; and if you noticed the light\nwreath of vapor from the spiracle at his other extremity, you would think that\nthat was the smoke from the touch-hole.\n\nFifth: As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes lie\nconsiderably below the level of his back, they are then completely out of sight\nbeneath the surface; but when he is about to plunge into the deeps, his entire\nflukes with at least thirty feet of his body are tossed erect in the air, and so\nremain vibrating a moment, till they downwards shoot out of view. Excepting the\nsublime breach—somewhere else to be described—this peaking of the whale’s flukes\nis perhaps the grandest sight to be seen in all animated nature. Out of the\nbottomless profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the\nhighest heaven. So in dreams, have I seen majestic Satan thrusting forth his\ntormented colossal claw from the flame Baltic of Hell. But in gazing at such\nscenes, it is all in all what mood you are in; if in the Dantean, the devils\nwill occur to you; if in that of Isaiah, the archangels. Standing at the\nmast-head of my ship during a sunrise that crimsoned sky and sea, I once saw a\nlarge herd of whales in the east, all heading towards the sun, and for a moment\nvibrating in concert with peaked flukes. As it seemed to me at the time, such a\ngrand embodiment of adoration of the gods was never beheld, even in Persia, the\nhome of the fire worshippers. As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African\nelephant, I then testified of the whale, pronouncing him the most devout of all\nbeings. For according to King Juba, the military elephants of antiquity often\nhailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the profoundest silence.\n\nThe chance comparison in this chapter, between the whale and the elephant, so\nfar as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk of the other are\nconcerned, should not tend to place those two opposite organs on an equality,\nmuch less the creatures to which they respectively belong. For as the mightiest\nelephant is but a terrier to Leviathan, so, compared with Leviathan’s tail, his\ntrunk is but the stalk of a lily. The most direful blow from the elephant’s\ntrunk were as the playful tap of a fan, compared with the measureless crush and\ncrash of the sperm whale’s ponderous flukes, which in repeated instances have\none after the other hurled entire boats with all their oars and crews into the\nair, very much as an Indian juggler tosses his balls.*\n\n*Though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale and the\nelephant is preposterous, inasmuch as in that particular the elephant stands in\nmuch the same respect to the whale that a dog does to the elephant;\nnevertheless, there are not wanting some points of curious similitude; among\nthese is the spout. It is well known that the elephant will often draw up water\nor dust in his trunk, and then elevating it, jet it forth in a stream.\n\nThe more I consider this mighty tail, the more do I deplore my inability to\nexpress it. At times there are gestures in it, which, though they would well\ngrace the hand of man, remain wholly inexplicable. In an extensive herd, so\nremarkable, occasionally, are these mystic gestures, that I have heard hunters\nwho have declared them akin to Free-Mason signs and symbols; that the whale,\nindeed, by these methods intelligently conversed with the world. Nor are there\nwanting other motions of the whale in his general body, full of strangeness, and\nunaccountable to his most experienced assailant. Dissect him how I may, then, I\nbut go skin deep; I know him not, and never will. But if I know not even the\ntail of this whale, how understand his head? much more, how comprehend his face,\nwhen face he has none? Thou shalt see my back parts, my tail, he seems to say,\nbut my face shall not be seen. But I cannot completely make out his back parts;\nand hint what he will about his face, I say again he has no face.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 87. THE GRAND ARMADA.\n\nThe long and narrow peninsula of Malacca, extending south-eastward from the\nterritories of Birmah, forms the most southerly point of all Asia. In a\ncontinuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands of Sumatra, Java,\nBally, and Timor; which, with many others, form a vast mole, or rampart,\nlengthwise connecting Asia with Australia, and dividing the long unbroken Indian\nocean from the thickly studded oriental archipelagoes. This rampart is pierced\nby several sally-ports for the convenience of ships and whales; conspicuous\namong which are the straits of Sunda and Malacca. By the straits of Sunda,\nchiefly, vessels bound to China from the west, emerge into the China seas.\n\nThose narrow straits of Sunda divide Sumatra from Java; and standing midway in\nthat vast rampart of islands, buttressed by that bold green promontory, known to\nseamen as Java Head; they not a little correspond to the central gateway opening\ninto some vast walled empire: and considering the inexhaustible wealth of\nspices, and silks, and jewels, and gold, and ivory, with which the thousand\nislands of that oriental sea are enriched, it seems a significant provision of\nnature, that such treasures, by the very formation of the land, should at least\nbear the appearance, however ineffectual, of being guarded from the all-grasping\nwestern world. The shores of the Straits of Sunda are unsupplied with those\ndomineering fortresses which guard the entrances to the Mediterranean, the\nBaltic, and the Propontis. Unlike the Danes, these Orientals do not demand the\nobsequious homage of lowered top-sails from the endless procession of ships\nbefore the wind, which for centuries past, by night and by day, have passed\nbetween the islands of Sumatra and Java, freighted with the costliest cargoes of\nthe east. But while they freely waive a ceremonial like this, they do by no\nmeans renounce their claim to more solid tribute.\n\nTime out of mind the piratical proas of the Malays, lurking among the low shaded\ncoves and islets of Sumatra, have sallied out upon the vessels sailing through\nthe straits, fiercely demanding tribute at the point of their spears. Though by\nthe repeated bloody chastisements they have received at the hands of European\ncruisers, the audacity of these corsairs has of late been somewhat repressed;\nyet, even at the present day, we occasionally hear of English and American\nvessels, which, in those waters, have been remorselessly boarded and pillaged.\n\nWith a fair, fresh wind, the Pequod was now drawing nigh to these straits; Ahab\npurposing to pass through them into the Javan sea, and thence, cruising\nnorthwards, over waters known to be frequented here and there by the Sperm\nWhale, sweep inshore by the Philippine Islands, and gain the far coast of Japan,\nin time for the great whaling season there. By these means, the circumnavigating\nPequod would sweep almost all the known Sperm Whale cruising grounds of the\nworld, previous to descending upon the Line in the Pacific; where Ahab, though\neverywhere else foiled in his pursuit, firmly counted upon giving battle to Moby\nDick, in the sea he was most known to frequent; and at a season when he might\nmost reasonably be presumed to be haunting it.\n\nBut how now? in this zoned quest, does Ahab touch no land? does his crew drink\nair? Surely, he will stop for water. Nay. For a long time, now, the\ncircus-running sun has raced within his fiery ring, and needs no sustenance but\nwhat’s in himself. So Ahab. Mark this, too, in the whaler. While other hulls are\nloaded down with alien stuff, to be transferred to foreign wharves; the\nworld-wandering whale-ship carries no cargo but herself and crew, their weapons\nand their wants. She has a whole lake’s contents bottled in her ample hold. She\nis ballasted with utilities; not altogether with unusable pig-lead and\nkentledge. She carries years’ water in her. Clear old prime Nantucket water;\nwhich, when three years afloat, the Nantucketer, in the Pacific, prefers to\ndrink before the brackish fluid, but yesterday rafted off in casks, from the\nPeruvian or Indian streams. Hence it is, that, while other ships may have gone\nto China from New York, and back again, touching at a score of ports, the\nwhale-ship, in all that interval, may not have sighted one grain of soil; her\ncrew having seen no man but floating seamen like themselves. So that did you\ncarry them the news that another flood had come; they would only answer—“Well,\nboys, here’s the ark!”\n\nNow, as many Sperm Whales had been captured off the western coast of Java, in\nthe near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda; indeed, as most of the ground,\nroundabout, was generally recognised by the fishermen as an excellent spot for\ncruising; therefore, as the Pequod gained more and more upon Java Head, the\nlook-outs were repeatedly hailed, and admonished to keep wide awake. But though\nthe green palmy cliffs of the land soon loomed on the starboard bow, and with\ndelighted nostrils the fresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air, yet not a single\njet was descried. Almost renouncing all thought of falling in with any game\nhereabouts, the ship had well nigh entered the straits, when the customary\ncheering cry was heard from aloft, and ere long a spectacle of singular\nmagnificence saluted us.\n\nBut here be it premised, that owing to the unwearied activity with which of late\nthey have been hunted over all four oceans, the Sperm Whales, instead of almost\ninvariably sailing in small detached companies, as in former times, are now\nfrequently met with in extensive herds, sometimes embracing so great a\nmultitude, that it would almost seem as if numerous nations of them had sworn\nsolemn league and covenant for mutual assistance and protection. To this\naggregation of the Sperm Whale into such immense caravans, may be imputed the\ncircumstance that even in the best cruising grounds, you may now sometimes sail\nfor weeks and months together, without being greeted by a single spout; and then\nbe suddenly saluted by what sometimes seems thousands on thousands.\n\nBroad on both bows, at the distance of some two or three miles, and forming a\ngreat semicircle, embracing one half of the level horizon, a continuous chain of\nwhale-jets were up-playing and sparkling in the noon-day air. Unlike the\nstraight perpendicular twin-jets of the Right Whale, which, dividing at top,\nfall over in two branches, like the cleft drooping boughs of a willow, the\nsingle forward-slanting spout of the Sperm Whale presents a thick curled bush of\nwhite mist, continually rising and falling away to leeward.\n\nSeen from the Pequod’s deck, then, as she would rise on a high hill of the sea,\nthis host of vapory spouts, individually curling up into the air, and beheld\nthrough a blending atmosphere of bluish haze, showed like the thousand cheerful\nchimneys of some dense metropolis, descried of a balmy autumnal morning, by some\nhorseman on a height.\n\nAs marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains, accelerate\ntheir march, all eagerness to place that perilous passage in their rear, and\nonce more expand in comparative security upon the plain; even so did this vast\nfleet of whales now seem hurrying forward through the straits; gradually\ncontracting the wings of their semicircle, and swimming on, in one solid, but\nstill crescentic centre.\n\nCrowding all sail the Pequod pressed after them; the harpooneers handling their\nweapons, and loudly cheering from the heads of their yet suspended boats. If the\nwind only held, little doubt had they, that chased through these Straits of\nSunda, the vast host would only deploy into the Oriental seas to witness the\ncapture of not a few of their number. And who could tell whether, in that\ncongregated caravan, Moby Dick himself might not temporarily be swimming, like\nthe worshipped white-elephant in the coronation procession of the Siamese! So\nwith stun-sail piled on stun-sail, we sailed along, driving these leviathans\nbefore us; when, of a sudden, the voice of Tashtego was heard, loudly directing\nattention to something in our wake.\n\nCorresponding to the crescent in our van, we beheld another in our rear. It\nseemed formed of detached white vapors, rising and falling something like the\nspouts of the whales; only they did not so completely come and go; for they\nconstantly hovered, without finally disappearing. Levelling his glass at this\nsight, Ahab quickly revolved in his pivot-hole, crying, “Aloft there, and rig\nwhips and buckets to wet the sails;—Malays, sir, and after us!”\n\nAs if too long lurking behind the headlands, till the Pequod should fairly have\nentered the straits, these rascally Asiatics were now in hot pursuit, to make up\nfor their over-cautious delay. But when the swift Pequod, with a fresh leading\nwind, was herself in hot chase; how very kind of these tawny philanthropists to\nassist in speeding her on to her own chosen pursuit,—mere riding-whips and\nrowels to her, that they were. As with glass under arm, Ahab to-and-fro paced\nthe deck; in his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased, and in the after\none the bloodthirsty pirates chasing him; some such fancy as the above seemed\nhis. And when he glanced upon the green walls of the watery defile in which the\nship was then sailing, and bethought him that through that gate lay the route to\nhis vengeance, and beheld, how that through that same gate he was now both\nchasing and being chased to his deadly end; and not only that, but a herd of\nremorseless wild pirates and inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering\nhim on with their curses;—when all these conceits had passed through his brain,\nAhab’s brow was left gaunt and ribbed, like the black sand beach after some\nstormy tide has been gnawing it, without being able to drag the firm thing from\nits place.\n\nBut thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew; and when, after\nsteadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern, the Pequod at last shot by\nthe vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra side, emerging at last upon the\nbroad waters beyond; then, the harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift\nwhales had been gaining upon the ship, than to rejoice that the ship had so\nvictoriously gained upon the Malays. But still driving on in the wake of the\nwhales, at length they seemed abating their speed; gradually the ship neared\nthem; and the wind now dying away, word was passed to spring to the boats. But\nno sooner did the herd, by some presumed wonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale,\nbecome notified of the three keels that were after them,—though as yet a mile in\ntheir rear,—than they rallied again, and forming in close ranks and battalions,\nso that their spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked bayonets, moved\non with redoubled velocity.\n\nStripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash, and after\nseveral hours’ pulling were almost disposed to renounce the chase, when a\ngeneral pausing commotion among the whales gave animating token that they were\nnow at last under the influence of that strange perplexity of inert\nirresolution, which, when the fishermen perceive it in the whale, they say he is\ngallied. The compact martial columns in which they had been hitherto rapidly and\nsteadily swimming, were now broken up in one measureless rout; and like King\nPorus’ elephants in the Indian battle with Alexander, they seemed going mad with\nconsternation. In all directions expanding in vast irregular circles, and\naimlessly swimming hither and thither, by their short thick spoutings, they\nplainly betrayed their distraction of panic. This was still more strangely\nevinced by those of their number, who, completely paralysed as it were,\nhelplessly floated like water-logged dismantled ships on the sea. Had these\nLeviathans been but a flock of simple sheep, pursued over the pasture by three\nfierce wolves, they could not possibly have evinced such excessive dismay. But\nthis occasional timidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures.\nThough banding together in tens of thousands, the lion-maned buffaloes of the\nWest have fled before a solitary horseman. Witness, too, all human beings, how\nwhen herded together in the sheepfold of a theatre’s pit, they will, at the\nslightest alarm of fire, rush helter-skelter for the outlets, crowding,\ntrampling, jamming, and remorselessly dashing each other to death. Best,\ntherefore, withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whales before us, for\nthere is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not infinitely outdone by\nthe madness of men.\n\nThough many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion, yet it is\nto be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor retreated, but\ncollectively remained in one place. As is customary in those cases, the boats at\nonce separated, each making for some one lone whale on the outskirts of the\nshoal. In about three minutes’ time, Queequeg’s harpoon was flung; the stricken\nfish darted blinding spray in our faces, and then running away with us like\nlight, steered straight for the heart of the herd. Though such a movement on the\npart of the whale struck under such circumstances, is in no wise unprecedented;\nand indeed is almost always more or less anticipated; yet does it present one of\nthe more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. For as the swift monster drags\nyou deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal, you bid adieu to circumspect life\nand only exist in a delirious throb.\n\nAs, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power of speed to\nrid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him; as we thus tore a white\ngash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we flew, by the crazed creatures to and\nfro rushing about us; our beset boat was like a ship mobbed by ice-isles in a\ntempest, and striving to steer through their complicated channels and straits,\nknowing not at what moment it may be locked in and crushed.\n\nBut not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us manfully; now sheering off from this\nmonster directly across our route in advance; now edging away from that, whose\ncolossal flukes were suspended overhead, while all the time, Starbuck stood up\nin the bows, lance in hand, pricking out of our way whatever whales he could\nreach by short darts, for there was no time to make long ones. Nor were the\noarsmen quite idle, though their wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with.\nThey chiefly attended to the shouting part of the business. “Out of the way,\nCommodore!” cried one, to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the\nsurface, and for an instant threatened to swamp us. “Hard down with your tail,\nthere!” cried a second to another, which, close to our gunwale, seemed calmly\ncooling himself with his own fan-like extremity.\n\nAll whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally invented by the\nNantucket Indians, called druggs. Two thick squares of wood of equal size are\nstoutly clenched together, so that they cross each other’s grain at right\nangles; a line of considerable length is then attached to the middle of this\nblock, and the other end of the line being looped, it can in a moment be\nfastened to a harpoon. It is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is\nused. For then, more whales are close round you than you can possibly chase at\none time. But sperm whales are not every day encountered; while you may, then,\nyou must kill all you can. And if you cannot kill them all at once, you must\nwing them, so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure. Hence it is,\nthat at times like these the drugg, comes into requisition. Our boat was\nfurnished with three of them. The first and second were successfully darted, and\nwe saw the whales staggeringly running off, fettered by the enormous sidelong\nresistance of the towing drugg. They were cramped like malefactors with the\nchain and ball. But upon flinging the third, in the act of tossing overboard the\nclumsy wooden block, it caught under one of the seats of the boat, and in an\ninstant tore it out and carried it away, dropping the oarsman in the boat’s\nbottom as the seat slid from under him. On both sides the sea came in at the\nwounded planks, but we stuffed two or three drawers and shirts in, and so\nstopped the leaks for the time.\n\nIt had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were it not that\nas we advanced into the herd, our whale’s way greatly diminished; moreover, that\nas we went still further and further from the circumference of commotion, the\ndireful disorders seemed waning. So that when at last the jerking harpoon drew\nout, and the towing whale sideways vanished; then, with the tapering force of\nhis parting momentum, we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of\nthe shoal, as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene valley\nlake. Here the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost whales, were\nheard but not felt. In this central expanse the sea presented that smooth\nsatin-like surface, called a sleek, produced by the subtle moisture thrown off\nby the whale in his more quiet moods. Yes, we were now in that enchanted calm\nwhich they say lurks at the heart of every commotion. And still in the\ndistracted distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles, and\nsaw successive pods of whales, eight or ten in each, swiftly going round and\nround, like multiplied spans of horses in a ring; and so closely shoulder to\nshoulder, that a Titanic circus-rider might easily have over-arched the middle\nones, and so have gone round on their backs. Owing to the density of the crowd\nof reposing whales, more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd,\nno possible chance of escape was at present afforded us. We must watch for a\nbreach in the living wall that hemmed us in; the wall that had only admitted us\nin order to shut us up. Keeping at the centre of the lake, we were occasionally\nvisited by small tame cows and calves; the women and children of this routed\nhost.\n\nNow, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving outer\ncircles, and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in any one of\nthose circles, the entire area at this juncture, embraced by the whole\nmultitude, must have contained at least two or three square miles. At any\nrate—though indeed such a test at such a time might be deceptive—spoutings might\nbe discovered from our low boat that seemed playing up almost from the rim of\nthe horizon. I mention this circumstance, because, as if the cows and calves had\nbeen purposely locked up in this innermost fold; and as if the wide extent of\nthe herd had hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its\nstopping; or, possibly, being so young, unsophisticated, and every way innocent\nand inexperienced; however it may have been, these smaller whales—now and then\nvisiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the lake—evinced a wondrous\nfearlessness and confidence, or else a still becharmed panic which it was\nimpossible not to marvel at. Like household dogs they came snuffling round us,\nright up to our gunwales, and touching them; till it almost seemed that some\nspell had suddenly domesticated them. Queequeg patted their foreheads; Starbuck\nscratched their backs with his lance; but fearful of the consequences, for the\ntime refrained from darting it.\n\nBut far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and still stranger\nworld met our eyes as we gazed over the side. For, suspended in those watery\nvaults, floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the whales, and those that\nby their enormous girth seemed shortly to become mothers. The lake, as I have\nhinted, was to a considerable depth exceedingly transparent; and as human\ninfants while suckling will calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast, as if\nleading two different lives at the time; and while yet drawing mortal\nnourishment, be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly\nreminiscence;—even so did the young of these whales seem looking up towards us,\nbut not at us, as if we were but a bit of Gulfweed in their new-born sight.\nFloating on their sides, the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us. One of these\nlittle infants, that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old, might\nhave measured some fourteen feet in length, and some six feet in girth. He was a\nlittle frisky; though as yet his body seemed scarce yet recovered from that\nirksome position it had so lately occupied in the maternal reticule; where, tail\nto head, and all ready for the final spring, the unborn whale lies bent like a\nTartar’s bow. The delicate side-fins, and the palms of his flukes, still freshly\nretained the plaited crumpled appearance of a baby’s ears newly arrived from\nforeign parts.\n\n“Line! line!” cried Queequeg, looking over the gunwale; “him fast! him fast!—Who\nline him! Who struck?—Two whale; one big, one little!”\n\n“What ails ye, man?” cried Starbuck.\n\n“Look-e here,” said Queequeg, pointing down.\n\nAs when the stricken whale, that from the tub has reeled out hundreds of fathoms\nof rope; as, after deep sounding, he floats up again, and shows the slackened\ncurling line buoyantly rising and spiralling towards the air; so now, Starbuck\nsaw long coils of the umbilical cord of Madame Leviathan, by which the young cub\nseemed still tethered to its dam. Not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the\nchase, this natural line, with the maternal end loose, becomes entangled with\nthe hempen one, so that the cub is thereby trapped. Some of the subtlest secrets\nof the seas seemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond. We saw young Leviathan\namours in the deep.*\n\n*The sperm whale, as with all other species of the Leviathan, but unlike most\nother fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons; after a gestation which may\nprobably be set down at nine months, producing but one at a time; though in some\nfew known instances giving birth to an Esau and Jacob:—a contingency provided\nfor in suckling by two teats, curiously situated, one on each side of the anus;\nbut the breasts themselves extend upwards from that. When by chance these\nprecious parts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter’s lance, the mother’s\npouring milk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for rods. The milk is very\nsweet and rich; it has been tasted by man; it might do well with strawberries.\nWhen overflowing with mutual esteem, the whales salute more hominum.\n\nAnd thus, though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations and\naffrights, did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and fearlessly\nindulge in all peaceful concernments; yea, serenely revelled in dalliance and\ndelight. But even so, amid the tornadoed Atlantic of my being, do I myself still\nfor ever centrally disport in mute calm; and while ponderous planets of unwaning\nwoe revolve round me, deep down and deep inland there I still bathe me in\neternal mildness of joy.\n\nMeanwhile, as we thus lay entranced, the occasional sudden frantic spectacles in\nthe distance evinced the activity of the other boats, still engaged in drugging\nthe whales on the frontier of the host; or possibly carrying on the war within\nthe first circle, where abundance of room and some convenient retreats were\nafforded them. But the sight of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly\ndarting to and fro across the circles, was nothing to what at last met our eyes.\nIt is sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful and\nalert, to seek to hamstring him, as it were, by sundering or maiming his\ngigantic tail-tendon. It is done by darting a short-handled cutting-spade, to\nwhich is attached a rope for hauling it back again. A whale wounded (as we\nafterwards learned) in this part, but not effectually, as it seemed, had broken\naway from the boat, carrying along with him half of the harpoon line; and in the\nextraordinary agony of the wound, he was now dashing among the revolving circles\nlike the lone mounted desperado Arnold, at the battle of Saratoga, carrying\ndismay wherever he went.\n\nBut agonizing as was the wound of this whale, and an appalling spectacle enough,\nany way; yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed to inspire the rest of the\nherd, was owing to a cause which at first the intervening distance obscured from\nus. But at length we perceived that by one of the unimaginable accidents of the\nfishery, this whale had become entangled in the harpoon-line that he towed; he\nhad also run away with the cutting-spade in him; and while the free end of the\nrope attached to that weapon, had permanently caught in the coils of the\nharpoon-line round his tail, the cutting-spade itself had worked loose from his\nflesh. So that tormented to madness, he was now churning through the water,\nviolently flailing with his flexible tail, and tossing the keen spade about him,\nwounding and murdering his own comrades.\n\nThis terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their stationary\nfright. First, the whales forming the margin of our lake began to crowd a\nlittle, and tumble against each other, as if lifted by half spent billows from\nafar; then the lake itself began faintly to heave and swell; the submarine\nbridal-chambers and nurseries vanished; in more and more contracting orbits the\nwhales in the more central circles began to swim in thickening clusters. Yes,\nthe long calm was departing. A low advancing hum was soon heard; and then like\nto the tumultuous masses of block-ice when the great river Hudson breaks up in\nSpring, the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner centre, as if\nto pile themselves up in one common mountain. Instantly Starbuck and Queequeg\nchanged places; Starbuck taking the stern.\n\n“Oars! Oars!” he intensely whispered, seizing the helm—“gripe your oars, and\nclutch your souls, now! My God, men, stand by! Shove him off, you Queequeg—the\nwhale there!—prick him!—hit him! Stand up—stand up, and stay so! Spring,\nmen—pull, men; never mind their backs—scrape them!—scrape away!”\n\nThe boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks, leaving a narrow\nDardanelles between their long lengths. But by desperate endeavor we at last\nshot into a temporary opening; then giving way rapidly, and at the same time\nearnestly watching for another outlet. After many similar hair-breadth escapes,\nwe at last swiftly glided into what had just been one of the outer circles, but\nnow crossed by random whales, all violently making for one centre. This lucky\nsalvation was cheaply purchased by the loss of Queequeg’s hat, who, while\nstanding in the bows to prick the fugitive whales, had his hat taken clean from\nhis head by the air-eddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad flukes\nclose by.\n\nRiotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was, it soon resolved\nitself into what seemed a systematic movement; for having clumped together at\nlast in one dense body, they then renewed their onward flight with augmented\nfleetness. Further pursuit was useless; but the boats still lingered in their\nwake to pick up what drugged whales might be dropped astern, and likewise to\nsecure one which Flask had killed and waifed. The waif is a pennoned pole, two\nor three of which are carried by every boat; and which, when additional game is\nat hand, are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale, both to\nmark its place on the sea, and also as token of prior possession, should the\nboats of any other ship draw near.\n\nThe result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious saying\nin the Fishery,—the more whales the less fish. Of all the drugged whales only\none was captured. The rest contrived to escape for the time, but only to be\ntaken, as will hereafter be seen, by some other craft than the Pequod.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 88. SCHOOLS AND SCHOOLMASTERS.\n\nThe previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of Sperm Whales,\nand there was also then given the probable cause inducing those vast\naggregations.\n\nNow, though such great bodies are at times encountered, yet, as must have been\nseen, even at the present day, small detached bands are occasionally observed,\nembracing from twenty to fifty individuals each. Such bands are known as\nschools. They generally are of two sorts; those composed almost entirely of\nfemales, and those mustering none but young vigorous males, or bulls, as they\nare familiarly designated.\n\nIn cavalier attendance upon the school of females, you invariably see a male of\nfull grown magnitude, but not old; who, upon any alarm, evinces his gallantry by\nfalling in the rear and covering the flight of his ladies. In truth, this\ngentleman is a luxurious Ottoman, swimming about over the watery world,\nsurroundingly accompanied by all the solaces and endearments of the harem. The\ncontrast between this Ottoman and his concubines is striking; because, while he\nis always of the largest leviathanic proportions, the ladies, even at full\ngrowth, are not more than one-third of the bulk of an average-sized male. They\nare comparatively delicate, indeed; I dare say, not to exceed half a dozen yards\nround the waist. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied, that upon the whole they are\nhereditarily entitled to en bon point.\n\nIt is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent ramblings.\nLike fashionables, they are for ever on the move in leisurely search of variety.\nYou meet them on the Line in time for the full flower of the Equatorial feeding\nseason, having just returned, perhaps, from spending the summer in the Northern\nseas, and so cheating summer of all unpleasant weariness and warmth. By the time\nthey have lounged up and down the promenade of the Equator awhile, they start\nfor the Oriental waters in anticipation of the cool season there, and so evade\nthe other excessive temperature of the year.\n\nWhen serenely advancing on one of these journeys, if any strange suspicious\nsights are seen, my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his interesting family.\nShould any unwarrantably pert young Leviathan coming that way, presume to draw\nconfidentially close to one of the ladies, with what prodigious fury the Bashaw\nassails him, and chases him away! High times, indeed, if unprincipled young\nrakes like him are to be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss;\nthough do what the Bashaw will, he cannot keep the most notorious Lothario out\nof his bed; for, alas! all fish bed in common. As ashore, the ladies often cause\nthe most terrible duels among their rival admirers; just so with the whales, who\nsometimes come to deadly battle, and all for love. They fence with their long\nlower jaws, sometimes locking them together, and so striving for the supremacy\nlike elks that warringly interweave their antlers. Not a few are captured having\nthe deep scars of these encounters,—furrowed heads, broken teeth, scolloped\nfins; and in some instances, wrenched and dislocated mouths.\n\nBut supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at the first\nrush of the harem’s lord, then is it very diverting to watch that lord. Gently\nhe insinuates his vast bulk among them again and revels there awhile, still in\ntantalizing vicinity to young Lothario, like pious Solomon devoutly worshipping\namong his thousand concubines. Granting other whales to be in sight, the\nfishermen will seldom give chase to one of these Grand Turks; for these Grand\nTurks are too lavish of their strength, and hence their unctuousness is small.\nAs for the sons and the daughters they beget, why, those sons and daughters must\ntake care of themselves; at least, with only the maternal help. For like certain\nother omnivorous roving lovers that might be named, my Lord Whale has no taste\nfor the nursery, however much for the bower; and so, being a great traveller, he\nleaves his anonymous babies all over the world; every baby an exotic. In good\ntime, nevertheless, as the ardour of youth declines; as years and dumps\nincrease; as reflection lends her solemn pauses; in short, as a general\nlassitude overtakes the sated Turk; then a love of ease and virtue supplants the\nlove for maidens; our Ottoman enters upon the impotent, repentant, admonitory\nstage of life, forswears, disbands the harem, and grown to an exemplary, sulky\nold soul, goes about all alone among the meridians and parallels saying his\nprayers, and warning each young Leviathan from his amorous errors.\n\nNow, as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school, so is the lord\nand master of that school technically known as the schoolmaster. It is therefore\nnot in strict character, however admirably satirical, that after going to school\nhimself, he should then go abroad inculcating not what he learned there, but the\nfolly of it. His title, schoolmaster, would very naturally seem derived from the\nname bestowed upon the harem itself, but some have surmised that the man who\nfirst thus entitled this sort of Ottoman whale, must have read the memoirs of\nVidocq, and informed himself what sort of a country-schoolmaster that famous\nFrenchman was in his younger days, and what was the nature of those occult\nlessons he inculcated into some of his pupils.\n\nThe same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale betakes\nhimself in his advancing years, is true of all aged Sperm Whales. Almost\nuniversally, a lone whale—as a solitary Leviathan is called—proves an ancient\none. Like venerable moss-bearded Daniel Boone, he will have no one near him but\nNature herself; and her he takes to wife in the wilderness of waters, and the\nbest of wives she is, though she keeps so many moody secrets.\n\nThe schools composing none but young and vigorous males, previously mentioned,\noffer a strong contrast to the harem schools. For while those female whales are\ncharacteristically timid, the young males, or forty-barrel-bulls, as they call\nthem, are by far the most pugnacious of all Leviathans, and proverbially the\nmost dangerous to encounter; excepting those wondrous grey-headed, grizzled\nwhales, sometimes met, and these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by\na penal gout.\n\nThe Forty-barrel-bull schools are larger than the harem schools. Like a mob of\nyoung collegians, they are full of fight, fun, and wickedness, tumbling round\nthe world at such a reckless, rollicking rate, that no prudent underwriter would\ninsure them any more than he would a riotous lad at Yale or Harvard. They soon\nrelinquish this turbulence though, and when about three-fourths grown, break up,\nand separately go about in quest of settlements, that is, harems.\n\nAnother point of difference between the male and female schools is still more\ncharacteristic of the sexes. Say you strike a Forty-barrel-bull—poor devil! all\nhis comrades quit him. But strike a member of the harem school, and her\ncompanions swim around her with every token of concern, sometimes lingering so\nnear her and so long, as themselves to fall a prey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 89. FAST-FISH AND LOOSE-FISH.\n\nThe allusion to the waif and waif-poles in the last chapter but one,\nnecessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale fishery, of\nwhich the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge.\n\nIt frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company, a whale\nmay be struck by one vessel, then escape, and be finally killed and captured by\nanother vessel; and herein are indirectly comprised many minor contingencies,\nall partaking of this one grand feature. For example,—after a weary and perilous\nchase and capture of a whale, the body may get loose from the ship by reason of\na violent storm; and drifting far away to leeward, be retaken by a second\nwhaler, who, in a calm, snugly tows it alongside, without risk of life or line.\nThus the most vexatious and violent disputes would often arise between the\nfishermen, were there not some written or unwritten, universal, undisputed law\napplicable to all cases.\n\nPerhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative enactment, was\nthat of Holland. It was decreed by the States-General in A.D. 1695. But though\nno other nation has ever had any written whaling law, yet the American fishermen\nhave been their own legislators and lawyers in this matter. They have provided a\nsystem which for terse comprehensiveness surpasses Justinian’s Pandects and the\nBy-laws of the Chinese Society for the Suppression of Meddling with other\nPeople’s Business. Yes; these laws might be engraven on a Queen Anne’s farthing,\nor the barb of a harpoon, and worn round the neck, so small are they.\n\nI. A Fast-Fish belongs to the party fast to it.\n\nII. A Loose-Fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it.\n\nBut what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable brevity of\nit, which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to expound it.\n\nFirst: What is a Fast-Fish? Alive or dead a fish is technically fast, when it is\nconnected with an occupied ship or boat, by any medium at all controllable by\nthe occupant or occupants,—a mast, an oar, a nine-inch cable, a telegraph wire,\nor a strand of cobweb, it is all the same. Likewise a fish is technically fast\nwhen it bears a waif, or any other recognised symbol of possession; so long as\nthe party waifing it plainly evince their ability at any time to take it\nalongside, as well as their intention so to do.\n\nThese are scientific commentaries; but the commentaries of the whalemen\nthemselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocks—the\nCoke-upon-Littleton of the fist. True, among the more upright and honorable\nwhalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases, where it would be an\noutrageous moral injustice for one party to claim possession of a whale\npreviously chased or killed by another party. But others are by no means so\nscrupulous.\n\nSome fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale-trover litigated in\nEngland, wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of a whale in\nthe Northern seas; and when indeed they (the plaintiffs) had succeeded in\nharpooning the fish; they were at last, through peril of their lives, obliged to\nforsake not only their lines, but their boat itself. Ultimately the defendants\n(the crew of another ship) came up with the whale, struck, killed, seized, and\nfinally appropriated it before the very eyes of the plaintiffs. And when those\ndefendants were remonstrated with, their captain snapped his fingers in the\nplaintiffs’ teeth, and assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had\ndone, he would now retain their line, harpoons, and boat, which had remained\nattached to the whale at the time of the seizure. Wherefore the plaintiffs now\nsued for the recovery of the value of their whale, line, harpoons, and boat.\n\nMr. Erskine was counsel for the defendants; Lord Ellenborough was the judge. In\nthe course of the defence, the witty Erskine went on to illustrate his position,\nby alluding to a recent crim. con. case, wherein a gentleman, after in vain\ntrying to bridle his wife’s viciousness, had at last abandoned her upon the seas\nof life; but in the course of years, repenting of that step, he instituted an\naction to recover possession of her. Erskine was on the other side; and he then\nsupported it by saying, that though the gentleman had originally harpooned the\nlady, and had once had her fast, and only by reason of the great stress of her\nplunging viciousness, had at last abandoned her; yet abandon her he did, so that\nshe became a loose-fish; and therefore when a subsequent gentleman re-harpooned\nher, the lady then became that subsequent gentleman’s property, along with\nwhatever harpoon might have been found sticking in her.\n\nNow in the present case Erskine contended that the examples of the whale and the\nlady were reciprocally illustrative of each other.\n\nThese pleadings, and the counter pleadings, being duly heard, the very learned\njudge in set terms decided, to wit,—That as for the boat, he awarded it to the\nplaintiffs, because they had merely abandoned it to save their lives; but that\nwith regard to the controverted whale, harpoons, and line, they belonged to the\ndefendants; the whale, because it was a Loose-Fish at the time of the final\ncapture; and the harpoons and line because when the fish made off with them, it\n(the fish) acquired a property in those articles; and hence anybody who\nafterwards took the fish had a right to them. Now the defendants afterwards took\nthe fish; ergo, the aforesaid articles were theirs.\n\nA common man looking at this decision of the very learned Judge, might possibly\nobject to it. But ploughed up to the primary rock of the matter, the two great\nprinciples laid down in the twin whaling laws previously quoted, and applied and\nelucidated by Lord Ellenborough in the above cited case; these two laws touching\nFast-Fish and Loose-Fish, I say, will, on reflection, be found the fundamentals\nof all human jurisprudence; for notwithstanding its complicated tracery of\nsculpture, the Temple of the Law, like the Temple of the Philistines, has but\ntwo props to stand on.\n\nIs it not a saying in every one’s mouth, Possession is half of the law: that is,\nregardless of how the thing came into possession? But often possession is the\nwhole of the law. What are the sinews and souls of Russian serfs and Republican\nslaves but Fast-Fish, whereof possession is the whole of the law? What to the\nrapacious landlord is the widow’s last mite but a Fast-Fish? What is yonder\nundetected villain’s marble mansion with a door-plate for a waif; what is that\nbut a Fast-Fish? What is the ruinous discount which Mordecai, the broker, gets\nfrom poor Woebegone, the bankrupt, on a loan to keep Woebegone’s family from\nstarvation; what is that ruinous discount but a Fast-Fish? What is the\nArchbishop of Savesoul’s income of £100,000 seized from the scant bread and\ncheese of hundreds of thousands of broken-backed laborers (all sure of heaven\nwithout any of Savesoul’s help) what is that globular £100,000 but a Fast-Fish?\nWhat are the Duke of Dunder’s hereditary towns and hamlets but Fast-Fish? What\nto that redoubted harpooneer, John Bull, is poor Ireland, but a Fast-Fish? What\nto that apostolic lancer, Brother Jonathan, is Texas but a Fast-Fish? And\nconcerning all these, is not Possession the whole of the law?\n\nBut if the doctrine of Fast-Fish be pretty generally applicable, the kindred\ndoctrine of Loose-Fish is still more widely so. That is internationally and\nuniversally applicable.\n\nWhat was America in 1492 but a Loose-Fish, in which Columbus struck the Spanish\nstandard by way of waifing it for his royal master and mistress? What was Poland\nto the Czar? What Greece to the Turk? What India to England? What at last will\nMexico be to the United States? All Loose-Fish.\n\nWhat are the Rights of Man and the Liberties of the World but Loose-Fish? What\nall men’s minds and opinions but Loose-Fish? What is the principle of religious\nbelief in them but a Loose-Fish? What to the ostentatious smuggling verbalists\nare the thoughts of thinkers but Loose-Fish? What is the great globe itself but\na Loose-Fish? And what are you, reader, but a Loose-Fish and a Fast-Fish, too?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 90. HEADS OR TAILS.\n\n“De balena vero sufficit, si rex habeat caput, et regina caudam.” Bracton, l. 3,\nc. 3.\n\nLatin from the books of the Laws of England, which taken along with the context,\nmeans, that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of that land, the\nKing, as Honorary Grand Harpooneer, must have the head, and the Queen be\nrespectfully presented with the tail. A division which, in the whale, is much\nlike halving an apple; there is no intermediate remainder. Now as this law,\nunder a modified form, is to this day in force in England; and as it offers in\nvarious respects a strange anomaly touching the general law of Fast and\nLoose-Fish, it is here treated of in a separate chapter, on the same courteous\nprinciple that prompts the English railways to be at the expense of a separate\ncar, specially reserved for the accommodation of royalty. In the first place, in\ncurious proof of the fact that the above-mentioned law is still in force, I\nproceed to lay before you a circumstance that happened within the last two\nyears.\n\nIt seems that some honest mariners of Dover, or Sandwich, or some one of the\nCinque Ports, had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and beaching a fine\nwhale which they had originally descried afar off from the shore. Now the Cinque\nPorts are partially or somehow under the jurisdiction of a sort of policeman or\nbeadle, called a Lord Warden. Holding the office directly from the crown, I\nbelieve, all the royal emoluments incident to the Cinque Port territories become\nby assignment his. By some writers this office is called a sinecure. But not so.\nBecause the Lord Warden is busily employed at times in fobbing his perquisites;\nwhich are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing of them.\n\nNow when these poor sun-burnt mariners, bare-footed, and with their trowsers\nrolled high up on their eely legs, had wearily hauled their fat fish high and\ndry, promising themselves a good £150 from the precious oil and bone; and in\nfantasy sipping rare tea with their wives, and good ale with their cronies, upon\nthe strength of their respective shares; up steps a very learned and most\nChristian and charitable gentleman, with a copy of Blackstone under his arm; and\nlaying it upon the whale’s head, he says—“Hands off! this fish, my masters, is a\nFast-Fish. I seize it as the Lord Warden’s.” Upon this the poor mariners in\ntheir respectful consternation—so truly English—knowing not what to say, fall to\nvigorously scratching their heads all round; meanwhile ruefully glancing from\nthe whale to the stranger. But that did in nowise mend the matter, or at all\nsoften the hard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of Blackstone. At\nlength one of them, after long scratching about for his ideas, made bold to\nspeak,\n\n“Please, sir, who is the Lord Warden?”\n\n“The Duke.”\n\n“But the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish?”\n\n“It is his.”\n\n“We have been at great trouble, and peril, and some expense, and is all that to\ngo to the Duke’s benefit; we getting nothing at all for our pains but our\nblisters?”\n\n“It is his.”\n\n“Is the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of getting a\nlivelihood?”\n\n“It is his.”\n\n“I thought to relieve my old bed-ridden mother by part of my share of this\nwhale.”\n\n“It is his.”\n\n“Won’t the Duke be content with a quarter or a half?”\n\n“It is his.”\n\nIn a word, the whale was seized and sold, and his Grace the Duke of Wellington\nreceived the money. Thinking that viewed in some particular lights, the case\nmight by a bare possibility in some small degree be deemed, under the\ncircumstances, a rather hard one, an honest clergyman of the town respectfully\naddressed a note to his Grace, begging him to take the case of those unfortunate\nmariners into full consideration. To which my Lord Duke in substance replied\n(both letters were published) that he had already done so, and received the\nmoney, and would be obliged to the reverend gentleman if for the future he (the\nreverend gentleman) would decline meddling with other people’s business. Is this\nthe still militant old man, standing at the corners of the three kingdoms, on\nall hands coercing alms of beggars?\n\nIt will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the Duke to the\nwhale was a delegated one from the Sovereign. We must needs inquire then on what\nprinciple the Sovereign is originally invested with that right. The law itself\nhas already been set forth. But Plowdon gives us the reason for it. Says\nPlowdon, the whale so caught belongs to the King and Queen, “because of its\nsuperior excellence.” And by the soundest commentators this has ever been held a\ncogent argument in such matters.\n\nBut why should the King have the head, and the Queen the tail? A reason for\nthat, ye lawyers!\n\nIn his treatise on “Queen-Gold,” or Queen-pinmoney, an old King’s Bench author,\none William Prynne, thus discourseth: “Ye tail is ye Queen’s, that ye Queen’s\nwardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone.” Now this was written at a time when\nthe black limber bone of the Greenland or Right whale was largely used in\nladies’ bodices. But this same bone is not in the tail; it is in the head, which\nis a sad mistake for a sagacious lawyer like Prynne. But is the Queen a mermaid,\nto be presented with a tail? An allegorical meaning may lurk here.\n\nThere are two royal fish so styled by the English law writers—the whale and the\nsturgeon; both royal property under certain limitations, and nominally supplying\nthe tenth branch of the crown’s ordinary revenue. I know not that any other\nauthor has hinted of the matter; but by inference it seems to me that the\nsturgeon must be divided in the same way as the whale, the King receiving the\nhighly dense and elastic head peculiar to that fish, which, symbolically\nregarded, may possibly be humorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality.\nAnd thus there seems a reason in all things, even in law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 91. THE PEQUOD MEETS THE ROSE-BUD.\n\n“In vain it was to rake for Ambergriese in the paunch of this Leviathan,\ninsufferable fetor denying not inquiry.” Sir T. Browne, V.E.\n\nIt was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted, and when we were\nslowly sailing over a sleepy, vapory, mid-day sea, that the many noses on the\nPequod’s deck proved more vigilant discoverers than the three pairs of eyes\naloft. A peculiar and not very pleasant smell was smelt in the sea.\n\n“I will bet something now,” said Stubb, “that somewhere hereabouts are some of\nthose drugged whales we tickled the other day. I thought they would keel up\nbefore long.”\n\nPresently, the vapors in advance slid aside; and there in the distance lay a\nship, whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must be alongside. As\nwe glided nearer, the stranger showed French colours from his peak; and by the\neddying cloud of vulture sea-fowl that circled, and hovered, and swooped around\nhim, it was plain that the whale alongside must be what the fishermen call a\nblasted whale, that is, a whale that has died unmolested on the sea, and so\nfloated an unappropriated corpse. It may well be conceived, what an unsavory\nodor such a mass must exhale; worse than an Assyrian city in the plague, when\nthe living are incompetent to bury the departed. So intolerable indeed is it\nregarded by some, that no cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it.\nYet are there those who will still do it; notwithstanding the fact that the oil\nobtained from such subjects is of a very inferior quality, and by no means of\nthe nature of attar-of-rose.\n\nComing still nearer with the expiring breeze, we saw that the Frenchman had a\nsecond whale alongside; and this second whale seemed even more of a nosegay than\nthe first. In truth, it turned out to be one of those problematical whales that\nseem to dry up and die with a sort of prodigious dyspepsia, or indigestion;\nleaving their defunct bodies almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil.\nNevertheless, in the proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will\never turn up his nose at such a whale as this, however much he may shun blasted\nwhales in general.\n\nThe Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger, that Stubb vowed he recognised\nhis cutting spade-pole entangled in the lines that were knotted round the tail\nof one of these whales.\n\n“There’s a pretty fellow, now,” he banteringly laughed, standing in the ship’s\nbows, “there’s a jackal for ye! I well know that these Crappoes of Frenchmen are\nbut poor devils in the fishery; sometimes lowering their boats for breakers,\nmistaking them for Sperm Whale spouts; yes, and sometimes sailing from their\nport with their hold full of boxes of tallow candles, and cases of snuffers,\nforeseeing that all the oil they will get won’t be enough to dip the Captain’s\nwick into; aye, we all know these things; but look ye, here’s a Crappo that is\ncontent with our leavings, the drugged whale there, I mean; aye, and is content\ntoo with scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has there. Poor\ndevil! I say, pass round a hat, some one, and let’s make him a present of a\nlittle oil for dear charity’s sake. For what oil he’ll get from that drugged\nwhale there, wouldn’t be fit to burn in a jail; no, not in a condemned cell. And\nas for the other whale, why, I’ll agree to get more oil by chopping up and\ntrying out these three masts of ours, than he’ll get from that bundle of bones;\nthough, now that I think of it, it may contain something worth a good deal more\nthan oil; yes, ambergris. I wonder now if our old man has thought of that. It’s\nworth trying. Yes, I’m for it;” and so saying he started for the quarter-deck.\n\nBy this time the faint air had become a complete calm; so that whether or no,\nthe Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell, with no hope of escaping\nexcept by its breezing up again. Issuing from the cabin, Stubb now called his\nboat’s crew, and pulled off for the stranger. Drawing across her bow, he\nperceived that in accordance with the fanciful French taste, the upper part of\nher stem-piece was carved in the likeness of a huge drooping stalk, was painted\ngreen, and for thorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there; the\nwhole terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colour. Upon her\nhead boards, in large gilt letters, he read “Bouton de Rose,”—Rose-button, or\nRose-bud; and this was the romantic name of this aromatic ship.\n\nThough Stubb did not understand the Bouton part of the inscription, yet the word\nrose, and the bulbous figure-head put together, sufficiently explained the whole\nto him.\n\n“A wooden rose-bud, eh?” he cried with his hand to his nose, “that will do very\nwell; but how like all creation it smells!”\n\nNow in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck, he had to\npull round the bows to the starboard side, and thus come close to the blasted\nwhale; and so talk over it.\n\nArrived then at this spot, with one hand still to his nose, he\nbawled—“Bouton-de-Rose, ahoy! are there any of you Bouton-de-Roses that speak\nEnglish?”\n\n“Yes,” rejoined a Guernsey-man from the bulwarks, who turned out to be the\nchief-mate.\n\n“Well, then, my Bouton-de-Rose-bud, have you seen the White Whale?”\n\n“What whale?”\n\n“The White Whale—a Sperm Whale—Moby Dick, have ye seen him?\n\n“Never heard of such a whale. Cachalot Blanche! White Whale—no.”\n\n“Very good, then; good bye now, and I’ll call again in a minute.”\n\nThen rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod, and seeing Ahab leaning over the\nquarter-deck rail awaiting his report, he moulded his two hands into a trumpet\nand shouted—“No, Sir! No!” Upon which Ahab retired, and Stubb returned to the\nFrenchman.\n\nHe now perceived that the Guernsey-man, who had just got into the chains, and\nwas using a cutting-spade, had slung his nose in a sort of bag.\n\n“What’s the matter with your nose, there?” said Stubb. “Broke it?”\n\n“I wish it was broken, or that I didn’t have any nose at all!” answered the\nGuernsey-man, who did not seem to relish the job he was at very much. “But what\nare you holding yours for?”\n\n“Oh, nothing! It’s a wax nose; I have to hold it on. Fine day, ain’t it? Air\nrather gardenny, I should say; throw us a bunch of posies, will ye,\nBouton-de-Rose?”\n\n“What in the devil’s name do you want here?” roared the Guernseyman, flying into\na sudden passion.\n\n“Oh! keep cool—cool? yes, that’s the word! why don’t you pack those whales in\nice while you’re working at ’em? But joking aside, though; do you know,\nRose-bud, that it’s all nonsense trying to get any oil out of such whales? As\nfor that dried up one, there, he hasn’t a gill in his whole carcase.”\n\n“I know that well enough; but, d’ye see, the Captain here won’t believe it; this\nis his first voyage; he was a Cologne manufacturer before. But come aboard, and\nmayhap he’ll believe you, if he won’t me; and so I’ll get out of this dirty\nscrape.”\n\n“Anything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow,” rejoined Stubb, and with\nthat he soon mounted to the deck. There a queer scene presented itself. The\nsailors, in tasselled caps of red worsted, were getting the heavy tackles in\nreadiness for the whales. But they worked rather slow and talked very fast, and\nseemed in anything but a good humor. All their noses upwardly projected from\ntheir faces like so many jib-booms. Now and then pairs of them would drop their\nwork, and run up to the mast-head to get some fresh air. Some thinking they\nwould catch the plague, dipped oakum in coal-tar, and at intervals held it to\ntheir nostrils. Others having broken the stems of their pipes almost short off\nat the bowl, were vigorously puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it constantly filled\ntheir olfactories.\n\nStubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from the\nCaptain’s round-house abaft; and looking in that direction saw a fiery face\nthrust from behind the door, which was held ajar from within. This was the\ntormented surgeon, who, after in vain remonstrating against the proceedings of\nthe day, had betaken himself to the Captain’s round-house (cabinet he called it)\nto avoid the pest; but still, could not help yelling out his entreaties and\nindignations at times.\n\nMarking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to the\nGuernsey-man had a little chat with him, during which the stranger mate\nexpressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited ignoramus, who had\nbrought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle. Sounding him\ncarefully, Stubb further perceived that the Guernsey-man had not the slightest\nsuspicion concerning the ambergris. He therefore held his peace on that head,\nbut otherwise was quite frank and confidential with him, so that the two quickly\nconcocted a little plan for both circumventing and satirizing the Captain,\nwithout his at all dreaming of distrusting their sincerity. According to this\nlittle plan of theirs, the Guernsey-man, under cover of an interpreter’s office,\nwas to tell the Captain what he pleased, but as coming from Stubb; and as for\nStubb, he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost in him during the\ninterview.\n\nBy this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin. He was a small and\ndark, but rather delicate looking man for a sea-captain, with large whiskers and\nmoustache, however; and wore a red cotton velvet vest with watch-seals at his\nside. To this gentleman, Stubb was now politely introduced by the Guernsey-man,\nwho at once ostentatiously put on the aspect of interpreting between them.\n\n“What shall I say to him first?” said he.\n\n“Why,” said Stubb, eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals, “you may as\nwell begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me, though I don’t\npretend to be a judge.”\n\n“He says, Monsieur,” said the Guernsey-man, in French, turning to his captain,\n“that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel, whose captain and chief-mate, with\nsix sailors, had all died of a fever caught from a blasted whale they had\nbrought alongside.”\n\nUpon this the captain started, and eagerly desired to know more.\n\n“What now?” said the Guernsey-man to Stubb.\n\n“Why, since he takes it so easy, tell him that now I have eyed him carefully,\nI’m quite certain that he’s no more fit to command a whale-ship than a St. Jago\nmonkey. In fact, tell him from me he’s a baboon.”\n\n“He vows and declares, Monsieur, that the other whale, the dried one, is far\nmore deadly than the blasted one; in fine, Monsieur, he conjures us, as we value\nour lives, to cut loose from these fish.”\n\nInstantly the captain ran forward, and in a loud voice commanded his crew to\ndesist from hoisting the cutting-tackles, and at once cast loose the cables and\nchains confining the whales to the ship.\n\n“What now?” said the Guernsey-man, when the Captain had returned to them.\n\n“Why, let me see; yes, you may as well tell him now that—that—in fact, tell him\nI’ve diddled him, and (aside to himself) perhaps somebody else.”\n\n“He says, Monsieur, that he’s very happy to have been of any service to us.”\n\nHearing this, the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties (meaning\nhimself and mate) and concluded by inviting Stubb down into his cabin to drink a\nbottle of Bordeaux.\n\n“He wants you to take a glass of wine with him,” said the interpreter.\n\n“Thank him heartily; but tell him it’s against my principles to drink with the\nman I’ve diddled. In fact, tell him I must go.”\n\n“He says, Monsieur, that his principles won’t admit of his drinking; but that if\nMonsieur wants to live another day to drink, then Monsieur had best drop all\nfour boats, and pull the ship away from these whales, for it’s so calm they\nwon’t drift.”\n\nBy this time Stubb was over the side, and getting into his boat, hailed the\nGuernsey-man to this effect,—that having a long tow-line in his boat, he would\ndo what he could to help them, by pulling out the lighter whale of the two from\nthe ship’s side. While the Frenchman’s boats, then, were engaged in towing the\nship one way, Stubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other way,\nostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long tow-line.\n\nPresently a breeze sprang up; Stubb feigned to cast off from the whale; hoisting\nhis boats, the Frenchman soon increased his distance, while the Pequod slid in\nbetween him and Stubb’s whale. Whereupon Stubb quickly pulled to the floating\nbody, and hailing the Pequod to give notice of his intentions, at once proceeded\nto reap the fruit of his unrighteous cunning. Seizing his sharp boat-spade, he\ncommenced an excavation in the body, a little behind the side fin. You would\nalmost have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea; and when at length\nhis spade struck against the gaunt ribs, it was like turning up old Roman tiles\nand pottery buried in fat English loam. His boat’s crew were all in high\nexcitement, eagerly helping their chief, and looking as anxious as gold-hunters.\n\nAnd all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking, and screaming, and\nyelling, and fighting around them. Stubb was beginning to look disappointed,\nespecially as the horrible nosegay increased, when suddenly from out the very\nheart of this plague, there stole a faint stream of perfume, which flowed\nthrough the tide of bad smells without being absorbed by it, as one river will\nflow into and then along with another, without at all blending with it for a\ntime.\n\n“I have it, I have it,” cried Stubb, with delight, striking something in the\nsubterranean regions, “a purse! a purse!”\n\nDropping his spade, he thrust both hands in, and drew out handfuls of something\nthat looked like ripe Windsor soap, or rich mottled old cheese; very unctuous\nand savory withal. You might easily dent it with your thumb; it is of a hue\nbetween yellow and ash colour. And this, good friends, is ambergris, worth a\ngold guinea an ounce to any druggist. Some six handfuls were obtained; but more\nwas unavoidably lost in the sea, and still more, perhaps, might have been\nsecured were it not for impatient Ahab’s loud command to Stubb to desist, and\ncome on board, else the ship would bid them good bye.\n\n"},{"title":"Test Section Title","content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 49. THE HYENA.\n\nThere are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed affair we call\nlife when a man takes this whole universe for a vast practical joke, though the\nwit thereof he but dimly discerns, and more than suspects that the joke is at\nnobody’s expense but his own. However, nothing dispirits, and nothing seems\nworth while disputing. He bolts down all events, all creeds, and beliefs, and\npersuasions, all hard things visible and invisible, never mind how knobby; as an\nostrich of potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints. And as for\nsmall difficulties and worryings, prospects of sudden disaster, peril of life\nand limb; all these, and death itself, seem to him only sly, good-natured hits,\nand jolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseen and unaccountable old\njoker. That odd sort of wayward mood I am speaking of, comes over a man only in\nsome time of extreme tribulation; it comes in the very midst of his earnestness,\nso that what just before might have seemed to him a thing most momentous, now\nseems but a part of the general joke. There is nothing like the perils of\nwhaling to breed this free and easy sort of genial, desperado philosophy; and\nwith it I now regarded this whole voyage of the Pequod, and the great White\nWhale its object.\n\n“Queequeg,” said I, when they had dragged me, the last man, to the deck, and I\nwas still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the water; “Queequeg, my fine\nfriend, does this sort of thing often happen?” Without much emotion, though\nsoaked through just like me, he gave me to understand that such things did often\nhappen.\n\n“Mr. Stubb,” said I, turning to that worthy, who, buttoned up in his oil-jacket,\nwas now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain; “Mr. Stubb, I think I have heard\nyou say that of all whalemen you ever met, our chief mate, Mr. Starbuck, is by\nfar the most careful and prudent. I suppose then, that going plump on a flying\nwhale with your sail set in a foggy squall is the height of a whaleman’s\ndiscretion?”\n\n“Certain. I’ve lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off Cape Horn.”\n\n“Mr. Flask,” said I, turning to little King-Post, who was standing close by;\n“you are experienced in these things, and I am not. Will you tell me whether it\nis an unalterable law in this fishery, Mr. Flask, for an oarsman to break his\nown back pulling himself back-foremost into death’s jaws?”\n\n“Can’t you twist that smaller?” said Flask. “Yes, that’s the law. I should like\nto see a boat’s crew backing water up to a whale face foremost. Ha, ha! the\nwhale would give them squint for squint, mind that!”\n\nHere then, from three impartial witnesses, I had a deliberate statement of the\nentire case. Considering, therefore, that squalls and capsizings in the water\nand consequent bivouacks on the deep, were matters of common occurrence in this\nkind of life; considering that at the superlatively critical instant of going on\nto the whale I must resign my life into the hands of him who steered the\nboat—oftentimes a fellow who at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon\nthe point of scuttling the craft with his own frantic stampings; considering\nthat the particular disaster to our own particular boat was chiefly to be\nimputed to Starbuck’s driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of a squall,\nand considering that Starbuck, notwithstanding, was famous for his great\nheedfulness in the fishery; considering that I belonged to this uncommonly\nprudent Starbuck’s boat; and finally considering in what a devil’s chase I was\nimplicated, touching the White Whale: taking all things together, I say, I\nthought I might as well go below and make a rough draft of my will. “Queequeg,”\nsaid I, “come along, you shall be my lawyer, executor, and legatee.”\n\nIt may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at their last\nwills and testaments, but there are no people in the world more fond of that\ndiversion. This was the fourth time in my nautical life that I had done the same\nthing. After the ceremony was concluded upon the present occasion, I felt all\nthe easier; a stone was rolled away from my heart. Besides, all the days I\nshould now live would be as good as the days that Lazarus lived after his\nresurrection; a supplementary clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case\nmight be. I survived myself; my death and burial were locked up in my chest. I\nlooked round me tranquilly and contentedly, like a quiet ghost with a clean\nconscience sitting inside the bars of a snug family vault.\n\nNow then, thought I, unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my frock, here goes\nfor a cool, collected dive at death and destruction, and the devil fetch the\nhindmost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 50. AHAB’S BOAT AND CREW. FEDALLAH.\n\n“Who would have thought it, Flask!” cried Stubb; “if I had but one leg you would\nnot catch me in a boat, unless maybe to stop the plug-hole with my timber toe.\nOh! he’s a wonderful old man!”\n\n“I don’t think it so strange, after all, on that account,” said Flask. “If his\nleg were off at the hip, now, it would be a different thing. That would disable\nhim; but he has one knee, and good part of the other left, you know.”\n\n“I don’t know that, my little man; I never yet saw him kneel.”\n\nAmong whale-wise people it has often been argued whether, considering the\nparamount importance of his life to the success of the voyage, it is right for a\nwhaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active perils of the chase. So\nTamerlane’s soldiers often argued with tears in their eyes, whether that\ninvaluable life of his ought to be carried into the thickest of the fight.\n\nBut with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect. Considering that with two\nlegs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger; considering that the\npursuit of whales is always under great and extraordinary difficulties; that\nevery individual moment, indeed, then comprises a peril; under these\ncircumstances is it wise for any maimed man to enter a whale-boat in the hunt?\nAs a general thing, the joint-owners of the Pequod must have plainly thought\nnot.\n\nAhab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of his\nentering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of the chase, for\nthe sake of being near the scene of action and giving his orders in person, yet\nfor Captain Ahab to have a boat actually apportioned to him as a regular\nheadsman in the hunt—above all for Captain Ahab to be supplied with five extra\nmen, as that same boat’s crew, he well knew that such generous conceits never\nentered the heads of the owners of the Pequod. Therefore he had not solicited a\nboat’s crew from them, nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head.\nNevertheless he had taken private measures of his own touching all that matter.\nUntil Cabaco’s published discovery, the sailors had little foreseen it, though\nto be sure when, after being a little while out of port, all hands had concluded\nthe customary business of fitting the whaleboats for service; when some time\nafter this Ahab was now and then found bestirring himself in the matter of\nmaking thole-pins with his own hands for what was thought to be one of the spare\nboats, and even solicitously cutting the small wooden skewers, which when the\nline is running out are pinned over the groove in the bow: when all this was\nobserved in him, and particularly his solicitude in having an extra coat of\nsheathing in the bottom of the boat, as if to make it better withstand the\npointed pressure of his ivory limb; and also the anxiety he evinced in exactly\nshaping the thigh board, or clumsy cleat, as it is sometimes called, the\nhorizontal piece in the boat’s bow for bracing the knee against in darting or\nstabbing at the whale; when it was observed how often he stood up in that boat\nwith his solitary knee fixed in the semi-circular depression in the cleat, and\nwith the carpenter’s chisel gouged out a little here and straightened it a\nlittle there; all these things, I say, had awakened much interest and curiosity\nat the time. But almost everybody supposed that this particular preparative\nheedfulness in Ahab must only be with a view to the ultimate chase of Moby Dick;\nfor he had already revealed his intention to hunt that mortal monster in person.\nBut such a supposition did by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any\nboat’s crew being assigned to that boat.\n\nNow, with the subordinate phantoms, what wonder remained soon waned away; for in\na whaler wonders soon wane. Besides, now and then such unaccountable odds and\nends of strange nations come up from the unknown nooks and ash-holes of the\nearth to man these floating outlaws of whalers; and the ships themselves often\npick up such queer castaway creatures found tossing about the open sea on\nplanks, bits of wreck, oars, whaleboats, canoes, blown-off Japanese junks, and\nwhat not; that Beelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down into the\ncabin to chat with the captain, and it would not create any unsubduable\nexcitement in the forecastle.\n\nBut be all this as it may, certain it is that while the subordinate phantoms\nsoon found their place among the crew, though still as it were somehow distinct\nfrom them, yet that hair-turbaned Fedallah remained a muffled mystery to the\nlast. Whence he came in a mannerly world like this, by what sort of\nunaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to be linked with Ahab’s peculiar\nfortunes; nay, so far as to have some sort of a half-hinted influence; Heaven\nknows, but it might have been even authority over him; all this none knew. But\none cannot sustain an indifferent air concerning Fedallah. He was such a\ncreature as civilized, domestic people in the temperate zone only see in their\ndreams, and that but dimly; but the like of whom now and then glide among the\nunchanging Asiatic communities, especially the Oriental isles to the east of the\ncontinent—those insulated, immemorial, unalterable countries, which even in\nthese modern days still preserve much of the ghostly aboriginalness of earth’s\nprimal generations, when the memory of the first man was a distinct\nrecollection, and all men his descendants, unknowing whence he came, eyed each\nother as real phantoms, and asked of the sun and the moon why they were created\nand to what end; when though, according to Genesis, the angels indeed consorted\nwith the daughters of men, the devils also, add the uncanonical Rabbins,\nindulged in mundane amours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 51. THE SPIRIT-SPOUT.\n\nDays, weeks passed, and under easy sail, the ivory Pequod had slowly swept\nacross four several cruising-grounds; that off the Azores; off the Cape de\nVerdes; on the Plate (so called), being off the mouth of the Rio de la Plata;\nand the Carrol Ground, an unstaked, watery locality, southerly from St. Helena.\n\nIt was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and moonlight\nnight, when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver; and, by their soft,\nsuffusing seethings, made what seemed a silvery silence, not a solitude; on such\na silent night a silvery jet was seen far in advance of the white bubbles at the\nbow. Lit up by the moon, it looked celestial; seemed some plumed and glittering\ngod uprising from the sea. Fedallah first descried this jet. For of these\nmoonlight nights, it was his wont to mount to the main-mast head, and stand a\nlook-out there, with the same precision as if it had been day. And yet, though\nherds of whales were seen by night, not one whaleman in a hundred would venture\na lowering for them. You may think with what emotions, then, the seamen beheld\nthis old Oriental perched aloft at such unusual hours; his turban and the moon,\ncompanions in one sky. But when, after spending his uniform interval there for\nseveral successive nights without uttering a single sound; when, after all this\nsilence, his unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery, moon-lit jet,\nevery reclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged spirit had lighted\nin the rigging, and hailed the mortal crew. “There she blows!” Had the trump of\njudgment blown, they could not have quivered more; yet still they felt no\nterror; rather pleasure. For though it was a most unwonted hour, yet so\nimpressive was the cry, and so deliriously exciting, that almost every soul on\nboard instinctively desired a lowering.\n\nWalking the deck with quick, side-lunging strides, Ahab commanded the t’gallant\nsails and royals to be set, and every stunsail spread. The best man in the ship\nmust take the helm. Then, with every mast-head manned, the piled-up craft rolled\ndown before the wind. The strange, upheaving, lifting tendency of the taffrail\nbreeze filling the hollows of so many sails, made the buoyant, hovering deck to\nfeel like air beneath the feet; while still she rushed along, as if two\nantagonistic influences were struggling in her—one to mount direct to heaven,\nthe other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal. And had you watched Ahab’s\nface that night, you would have thought that in him also two different things\nwere warring. While his one live leg made lively echoes along the deck, every\nstroke of his dead limb sounded like a coffin-tap. On life and death this old\nman walked. But though the ship so swiftly sped, and though from every eye, like\narrows, the eager glances shot, yet the silvery jet was no more seen that night.\nEvery sailor swore he saw it once, but not a second time.\n\nThis midnight-spout had almost grown a forgotten thing, when, some days after,\nlo! at the same silent hour, it was again announced: again it was descried by\nall; but upon making sail to overtake it, once more it disappeared as if it had\nnever been. And so it served us night after night, till no one heeded it but to\nwonder at it. Mysteriously jetted into the clear moonlight, or starlight, as the\ncase might be; disappearing again for one whole day, or two days, or three; and\nsomehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still further and\nfurther in our van, this solitary jet seemed for ever alluring us on.\n\nNor with the immemorial superstition of their race, and in accordance with the\npreternaturalness, as it seemed, which in many things invested the Pequod, were\nthere wanting some of the seamen who swore that whenever and wherever descried;\nat however remote times, or in however far apart latitudes and longitudes, that\nunnearable spout was cast by one self-same whale; and that whale, Moby Dick. For\na time, there reigned, too, a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting\napparition, as if it were treacherously beckoning us on and on, in order that\nthe monster might turn round upon us, and rend us at last in the remotest and\nmost savage seas.\n\nThese temporary apprehensions, so vague but so awful, derived a wondrous potency\nfrom the contrasting serenity of the weather, in which, beneath all its blue\nblandness, some thought there lurked a devilish charm, as for days and days we\nvoyaged along, through seas so wearily, lonesomely mild, that all space, in\nrepugnance to our vengeful errand, seemed vacating itself of life before our\nurn-like prow.\n\nBut, at last, when turning to the eastward, the Cape winds began howling around\nus, and we rose and fell upon the long, troubled seas that are there; when the\nivory-tusked Pequod sharply bowed to the blast, and gored the dark waves in her\nmadness, till, like showers of silver chips, the foam-flakes flew over her\nbulwarks; then all this desolate vacuity of life went away, but gave place to\nsights more dismal than before.\n\nClose to our bows, strange forms in the water darted hither and thither before\nus; while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea-ravens. And every morning,\nperched on our stays, rows of these birds were seen; and spite of our hootings,\nfor a long time obstinately clung to the hemp, as though they deemed our ship\nsome drifting, uninhabited craft; a thing appointed to desolation, and therefore\nfit roosting-place for their homeless selves. And heaved and heaved, still\nunrestingly heaved the black sea, as if its vast tides were a conscience; and\nthe great mundane soul were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and\nsuffering it had bred.\n\nCape of Good Hope, do they call ye? Rather Cape Tormentoso, as called of yore;\nfor long allured by the perfidious silences that before had attended us, we\nfound ourselves launched into this tormented sea, where guilty beings\ntransformed into those fowls and these fish, seemed condemned to swim on\neverlastingly without any haven in store, or beat that black air without any\nhorizon. But calm, snow-white, and unvarying; still directing its fountain of\nfeathers to the sky; still beckoning us on from before, the solitary jet would\nat times be descried.\n\nDuring all this blackness of the elements, Ahab, though assuming for the time\nthe almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous deck, manifested the\ngloomiest reserve; and more seldom than ever addressed his mates. In tempestuous\ntimes like these, after everything above and aloft has been secured, nothing\nmore can be done but passively to await the issue of the gale. Then Captain and\ncrew become practical fatalists. So, with his ivory leg inserted into its\naccustomed hole, and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud, Ahab for hours and\nhours would stand gazing dead to windward, while an occasional squall of sleet\nor snow would all but congeal his very eyelashes together. Meantime, the crew\ndriven from the forward part of the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly\nbroke over its bows, stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist; and the\nbetter to guard against the leaping waves, each man had slipped himself into a\nsort of bowline secured to the rail, in which he swung as in a loosened belt.\nFew or no words were spoken; and the silent ship, as if manned by painted\nsailors in wax, day after day tore on through all the swift madness and gladness\nof the demoniac waves. By night the same muteness of humanity before the shrieks\nof the ocean prevailed; still in silence the men swung in the bowlines; still\nwordless Ahab stood up to the blast. Even when wearied nature seemed demanding\nrepose he would not seek that repose in his hammock. Never could Starbuck forget\nthe old man’s aspect, when one night going down into the cabin to mark how the\nbarometer stood, he saw him with closed eyes sitting straight in his\nfloor-screwed chair; the rain and half-melted sleet of the storm from which he\nhad some time before emerged, still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat and\ncoat. On the table beside him lay unrolled one of those charts of tides and\ncurrents which have previously been spoken of. His lantern swung from his\ntightly clenched hand. Though the body was erect, the head was thrown back so\nthat the closed eyes were pointed towards the needle of the tell-tale that swung\nfrom a beam in the ceiling.*\n\n*The cabin-compass is called the tell-tale, because without going to the compass\nat the helm, the Captain, while below, can inform himself of the course of the\nship.\n\nTerrible old man! thought Starbuck with a shudder, sleeping in this gale, still\nthou steadfastly eyest thy purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 52. THE ALBATROSS.\n\nSouth-eastward from the Cape, off the distant Crozetts, a good cruising ground\nfor Right Whalemen, a sail loomed ahead, the Goney (Albatross) by name. As she\nslowly drew nigh, from my lofty perch at the fore-mast-head, I had a good view\nof that sight so remarkable to a tyro in the far ocean fisheries—a whaler at\nsea, and long absent from home.\n\nAs if the waves had been fullers, this craft was bleached like the skeleton of a\nstranded walrus. All down her sides, this spectral appearance was traced with\nlong channels of reddened rust, while all her spars and her rigging were like\nthe thick branches of trees furred over with hoar-frost. Only her lower sails\nwere set. A wild sight it was to see her long-bearded look-outs at those three\nmast-heads. They seemed clad in the skins of beasts, so torn and bepatched the\nraiment that had survived nearly four years of cruising. Standing in iron hoops\nnailed to the mast, they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea; and though,\nwhen the ship slowly glided close under our stern, we six men in the air came so\nnigh to each other that we might almost have leaped from the mast-heads of one\nship to those of the other; yet, those forlorn-looking fishermen, mildly eyeing\nus as they passed, said not one word to our own look-outs, while the\nquarter-deck hail was being heard from below.\n\n“Ship ahoy! Have ye seen the White Whale?”\n\nBut as the strange captain, leaning over the pallid bulwarks, was in the act of\nputting his trumpet to his mouth, it somehow fell from his hand into the sea;\nand the wind now rising amain, he in vain strove to make himself heard without\nit. Meantime his ship was still increasing the distance between. While in\nvarious silent ways the seamen of the Pequod were evincing their observance of\nthis ominous incident at the first mere mention of the White Whale’s name to\nanother ship, Ahab for a moment paused; it almost seemed as though he would have\nlowered a boat to board the stranger, had not the threatening wind forbade. But\ntaking advantage of his windward position, he again seized his trumpet, and\nknowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a Nantucketer and shortly\nbound home, he loudly hailed—“Ahoy there! This is the Pequod, bound round the\nworld! Tell them to address all future letters to the Pacific ocean! and this\ntime three years, if I am not at home, tell them to address them to ——”\n\nAt that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed, and instantly, then, in\naccordance with their singular ways, shoals of small harmless fish, that for\nsome days before had been placidly swimming by our side, darted away with what\nseemed shuddering fins, and ranged themselves fore and aft with the stranger’s\nflanks. Though in the course of his continual voyagings Ahab must often before\nhave noticed a similar sight, yet, to any monomaniac man, the veriest trifles\ncapriciously carry meanings.\n\n“Swim away from me, do ye?” murmured Ahab, gazing over into the water. There\nseemed but little in the words, but the tone conveyed more of deep helpless\nsadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced. But turning to the\nsteersman, who thus far had been holding the ship in the wind to diminish her\nheadway, he cried out in his old lion voice,—“Up helm! Keep her off round the\nworld!”\n\nRound the world! There is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings; but\nwhereto does all that circumnavigation conduct? Only through numberless perils\nto the very point whence we started, where those that we left behind secure,\nwere all the time before us.\n\nWere this world an endless plain, and by sailing eastward we could for ever\nreach new distances, and discover sights more sweet and strange than any\nCyclades or Islands of King Solomon, then there were promise in the voyage. But\nin pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of, or in tormented chase of that\ndemon phantom that, some time or other, swims before all human hearts; while\nchasing such over this round globe, they either lead us on in barren mazes or\nmidway leave us whelmed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 53. THE GAM.\n\nThe ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had spoken\nwas this: the wind and sea betokened storms. But even had this not been the\ncase, he would not after all, perhaps, have boarded her—judging by his\nsubsequent conduct on similar occasions—if so it had been that, by the process\nof hailing, he had obtained a negative answer to the question he put. For, as it\neventually turned out, he cared not to consort, even for five minutes, with any\nstranger captain, except he could contribute some of that information he so\nabsorbingly sought. But all this might remain inadequately estimated, were not\nsomething said here of the peculiar usages of whaling-vessels when meeting each\nother in foreign seas, and especially on a common cruising-ground.\n\nIf two strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New York State, or the equally\ndesolate Salisbury Plain in England; if casually encountering each other in such\ninhospitable wilds, these twain, for the life of them, cannot well avoid a\nmutual salutation; and stopping for a moment to interchange the news; and,\nperhaps, sitting down for a while and resting in concert: then, how much more\nnatural that upon the illimitable Pine Barrens and Salisbury Plains of the sea,\ntwo whaling vessels descrying each other at the ends of the earth—off lone\nFanning’s Island, or the far away King’s Mills; how much more natural, I say,\nthat under such circumstances these ships should not only interchange hails, but\ncome into still closer, more friendly and sociable contact. And especially would\nthis seem to be a matter of course, in the case of vessels owned in one seaport,\nand whose captains, officers, and not a few of the men are personally known to\neach other; and consequently, have all sorts of dear domestic things to talk\nabout.\n\nFor the long absent ship, the outward-bounder, perhaps, has letters on board; at\nany rate, she will be sure to let her have some papers of a date a year or two\nlater than the last one on her blurred and thumb-worn files. And in return for\nthat courtesy, the outward-bound ship would receive the latest whaling\nintelligence from the cruising-ground to which she may be destined, a thing of\nthe utmost importance to her. And in degree, all this will hold true concerning\nwhaling vessels crossing each other’s track on the cruising-ground itself, even\nthough they are equally long absent from home. For one of them may have received\na transfer of letters from some third, and now far remote vessel; and some of\nthose letters may be for the people of the ship she now meets. Besides, they\nwould exchange the whaling news, and have an agreeable chat. For not only would\nthey meet with all the sympathies of sailors, but likewise with all the peculiar\ncongenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually shared privations and\nperils.\n\nNor would difference of country make any very essential difference; that is, so\nlong as both parties speak one language, as is the case with Americans and\nEnglish. Though, to be sure, from the small number of English whalers, such\nmeetings do not very often occur, and when they do occur there is too apt to be\na sort of shyness between them; for your Englishman is rather reserved, and your\nYankee, he does not fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself. Besides,\nthe English whalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the\nAmerican whalers; regarding the long, lean Nantucketer, with his nondescript\nprovincialisms, as a sort of sea-peasant. But where this superiority in the\nEnglish whalemen does really consist, it would be hard to say, seeing that the\nYankees in one day, collectively, kill more whales than all the English,\ncollectively, in ten years. But this is a harmless little foible in the English\nwhale-hunters, which the Nantucketer does not take much to heart; probably,\nbecause he knows that he has a few foibles himself.\n\nSo, then, we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea, the whalers have\nmost reason to be sociable—and they are so. Whereas, some merchant ships\ncrossing each other’s wake in the mid-Atlantic, will oftentimes pass on without\nso much as a single word of recognition, mutually cutting each other on the high\nseas, like a brace of dandies in Broadway; and all the time indulging, perhaps,\nin finical criticism upon each other’s rig. As for Men-of-War, when they chance\nto meet at sea, they first go through such a string of silly bowings and\nscrapings, such a ducking of ensigns, that there does not seem to be much\nright-down hearty good-will and brotherly love about it at all. As touching\nSlave-ships meeting, why, they are in such a prodigious hurry, they run away\nfrom each other as soon as possible. And as for Pirates, when they chance to\ncross each other’s cross-bones, the first hail is—“How many skulls?”—the same\nway that whalers hail—“How many barrels?” And that question once answered,\npirates straightway steer apart, for they are infernal villains on both sides,\nand don’t like to see overmuch of each other’s villanous likenesses.\n\nBut look at the godly, honest, unostentatious, hospitable, sociable,\nfree-and-easy whaler! What does the whaler do when she meets another whaler in\nany sort of decent weather? She has a “Gam,” a thing so utterly unknown to all\nother ships that they never heard of the name even; and if by chance they should\nhear of it, they only grin at it, and repeat gamesome stuff about “spouters” and\n“blubber-boilers,” and such like pretty exclamations. Why it is that all\nMerchant-seamen, and also all Pirates and Man-of-War’s men, and Slave-ship\nsailors, cherish such a scornful feeling towards Whale-ships; this is a question\nit would be hard to answer. Because, in the case of pirates, say, I should like\nto know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory about it. It\nsometimes ends in uncommon elevation, indeed; but only at the gallows. And\nbesides, when a man is elevated in that odd fashion, he has no proper foundation\nfor his superior altitude. Hence, I conclude, that in boasting himself to be\nhigh lifted above a whaleman, in that assertion the pirate has no solid basis to\nstand on.\n\nBut what is a Gam? You might wear out your index-finger running up and down the\ncolumns of dictionaries, and never find the word. Dr. Johnson never attained to\nthat erudition; Noah Webster’s ark does not hold it. Nevertheless, this same\nexpressive word has now for many years been in constant use among some fifteen\nthousand true born Yankees. Certainly, it needs a definition, and should be\nincorporated into the Lexicon. With that view, let me learnedly define it.\n\nGAM. NOUN—A social meeting of two (or more) Whaleships, generally on a\ncruising-ground; when, after exchanging hails, they exchange visits by boats’\ncrews: the two captains remaining, for the time, on board of one ship, and the\ntwo chief mates on the other.\n\nThere is another little item about Gamming which must not be forgotten here. All\nprofessions have their own little peculiarities of detail; so has the whale\nfishery. In a pirate, man-of-war, or slave ship, when the captain is rowed\nanywhere in his boat, he always sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable,\nsometimes cushioned seat there, and often steers himself with a pretty little\nmilliner’s tiller decorated with gay cords and ribbons. But the whale-boat has\nno seat astern, no sofa of that sort whatever, and no tiller at all. High times\nindeed, if whaling captains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty\nold aldermen in patent chairs. And as for a tiller, the whale-boat never admits\nof any such effeminacy; and therefore as in gamming a complete boat’s crew must\nleave the ship, and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of the number,\nthat subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion, and the captain, having no\nplace to sit in, is pulled off to his visit all standing like a pine tree. And\noften you will notice that being conscious of the eyes of the whole visible\nworld resting on him from the sides of the two ships, this standing captain is\nall alive to the importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs.\nNor is this any very easy matter; for in his rear is the immense projecting\nsteering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back, the after-oar\nreciprocating by rapping his knees in front. He is thus completely wedged before\nand behind, and can only expand himself sideways by settling down on his\nstretched legs; but a sudden, violent pitch of the boat will often go far to\ntopple him, because length of foundation is nothing without corresponding\nbreadth. Merely make a spread angle of two poles, and you cannot stand them up.\nThen, again, it would never do in plain sight of the world’s riveted eyes, it\nwould never do, I say, for this straddling captain to be seen steadying himself\nthe slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his hands; indeed, as\ntoken of his entire, buoyant self-command, he generally carries his hands in his\ntrowsers’ pockets; but perhaps being generally very large, heavy hands, he\ncarries them there for ballast. Nevertheless there have occurred instances, well\nauthenticated ones too, where the captain has been known for an uncommonly\ncritical moment or two, in a sudden squall say—to seize hold of the nearest\noarsman’s hair, and hold on there like grim death.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 54. THE TOWN-HO’S STORY.\n\n(As told at the Golden Inn.)\n\nThe Cape of Good Hope, and all the watery region round about there, is much like\nsome noted four corners of a great highway, where you meet more travellers than\nin any other part.\n\nIt was not very long after speaking the Goney that another homeward-bound\nwhaleman, the Town-Ho,* was encountered. She was manned almost wholly by\nPolynesians. In the short gam that ensued she gave us strong news of Moby Dick.\nTo some the general interest in the White Whale was now wildly heightened by a\ncircumstance of the Town-Ho’s story, which seemed obscurely to involve with the\nwhale a certain wondrous, inverted visitation of one of those so called\njudgments of God which at times are said to overtake some men. This latter\ncircumstance, with its own particular accompaniments, forming what may be called\nthe secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated, never reached the ears of\nCaptain Ahab or his mates. For that secret part of the story was unknown to the\ncaptain of the Town-Ho himself. It was the private property of three confederate\nwhite seamen of that ship, one of whom, it seems, communicated it to Tashtego\nwith Romish injunctions of secrecy, but the following night Tashtego rambled in\nhis sleep, and revealed so much of it in that way, that when he was wakened he\ncould not well withhold the rest. Nevertheless, so potent an influence did this\nthing have on those seamen in the Pequod who came to the full knowledge of it,\nand by such a strange delicacy, to call it so, were they governed in this\nmatter, that they kept the secret among themselves so that it never transpired\nabaft the Pequod’s main-mast. Interweaving in its proper place this darker\nthread with the story as publicly narrated on the ship, the whole of this\nstrange affair I now proceed to put on lasting record.\n\n*The ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast-head, still\nused by whalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos terrapin.\n\nFor my humor’s sake, I shall preserve the style in which I once narrated it at\nLima, to a lounging circle of my Spanish friends, one saint’s eve, smoking upon\nthe thick-gilt tiled piazza of the Golden Inn. Of those fine cavaliers, the\nyoung Dons, Pedro and Sebastian, were on the closer terms with me; and hence the\ninterluding questions they occasionally put, and which are duly answered at the\ntime.\n\n“Some two years prior to my first learning the events which I am about\nrehearsing to you, gentlemen, the Town-Ho, Sperm Whaler of Nantucket, was\ncruising in your Pacific here, not very many days’ sail eastward from the eaves\nof this good Golden Inn. She was somewhere to the northward of the Line. One\nmorning upon handling the pumps, according to daily usage, it was observed that\nshe made more water in her hold than common. They supposed a sword-fish had\nstabbed her, gentlemen. But the captain, having some unusual reason for\nbelieving that rare good luck awaited him in those latitudes; and therefore\nbeing very averse to quit them, and the leak not being then considered at all\ndangerous, though, indeed, they could not find it after searching the hold as\nlow down as was possible in rather heavy weather, the ship still continued her\ncruisings, the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals; but no\ngood luck came; more days went by, and not only was the leak yet undiscovered,\nbut it sensibly increased. So much so, that now taking some alarm, the captain,\nmaking all sail, stood away for the nearest harbor among the islands, there to\nhave his hull hove out and repaired.\n\n“Though no small passage was before her, yet, if the commonest chance favoured,\nhe did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the way, because his pumps\nwere of the best, and being periodically relieved at them, those six-and-thirty\nmen of his could easily keep the ship free; never mind if the leak should double\non her. In truth, well nigh the whole of this passage being attended by very\nprosperous breezes, the Town-Ho had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety\nat her port without the occurrence of the least fatality, had it not been for\nthe brutal overbearing of Radney, the mate, a Vineyarder, and the bitterly\nprovoked vengeance of Steelkilt, a Lakeman and desperado from Buffalo.\n\n“‘Lakeman!—Buffalo! Pray, what is a Lakeman, and where is Buffalo?’ said Don\nSebastian, rising in his swinging mat of grass.\n\n“On the eastern shore of our Lake Erie, Don; but—I crave your courtesy—may be,\nyou shall soon hear further of all that. Now, gentlemen, in square-sail brigs\nand three-masted ships, well-nigh as large and stout as any that ever sailed out\nof your old Callao to far Manilla; this Lakeman, in the land-locked heart of our\nAmerica, had yet been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions\npopularly connected with the open ocean. For in their interflowing aggregate,\nthose grand fresh-water seas of ours,—Erie, and Ontario, and Huron, and\nSuperior, and Michigan,—possess an ocean-like expansiveness, with many of the\nocean’s noblest traits; with many of its rimmed varieties of races and of\nclimes. They contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles, even as the\nPolynesian waters do; in large part, are shored by two great contrasting\nnations, as the Atlantic is; they furnish long maritime approaches to our\nnumerous territorial colonies from the East, dotted all round their banks; here\nand there are frowned upon by batteries, and by the goat-like craggy guns of\nlofty Mackinaw; they have heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories; at\nintervals, they yield their beaches to wild barbarians, whose red painted faces\nflash from out their peltry wigwams; for leagues and leagues are flanked by\nancient and unentered forests, where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines of\nkings in Gothic genealogies; those same woods harboring wild Afric beasts of\nprey, and silken creatures whose exported furs give robes to Tartar Emperors;\nthey mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and Cleveland, as well as Winnebago\nvillages; they float alike the full-rigged merchant ship, the armed cruiser of\nthe State, the steamer, and the beech canoe; they are swept by Borean and\ndismasting blasts as direful as any that lash the salted wave; they know what\nshipwrecks are, for out of sight of land, however inland, they have drowned full\nmany a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew. Thus, gentlemen, though an\ninlander, Steelkilt was wild-ocean born, and wild-ocean nurtured; as much of an\naudacious mariner as any. And for Radney, though in his infancy he may have laid\nhim down on the lone Nantucket beach, to nurse at his maternal sea; though in\nafter life he had long followed our austere Atlantic and your contemplative\nPacific; yet was he quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the\nbackwoods seaman, fresh from the latitudes of buck-horn handled Bowie-knives.\nYet was this Nantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits; and this Lakeman,\na mariner, who though a sort of devil indeed, might yet by inflexible firmness,\nonly tempered by that common decency of human recognition which is the meanest\nslave’s right; thus treated, this Steelkilt had long been retained harmless and\ndocile. At all events, he had proved so thus far; but Radney was doomed and made\nmad, and Steelkilt—but, gentlemen, you shall hear.\n\n“It was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her prow for\nher island haven, that the Town-Ho’s leak seemed again increasing, but only so\nas to require an hour or more at the pumps every day. You must know that in a\nsettled and civilized ocean like our Atlantic, for example, some skippers think\nlittle of pumping their whole way across it; though of a still, sleepy night,\nshould the officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect, the\nprobability would be that he and his shipmates would never again remember it, on\naccount of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom. Nor in the solitary and\nsavage seas far from you to the westward, gentlemen, is it altogether unusual\nfor ships to keep clanging at their pump-handles in full chorus even for a\nvoyage of considerable length; that is, if it lie along a tolerably accessible\ncoast, or if any other reasonable retreat is afforded them. It is only when a\nleaky vessel is in some very out of the way part of those waters, some really\nlandless latitude, that her captain begins to feel a little anxious.\n\n“Much this way had it been with the Town-Ho; so when her leak was found gaining\nonce more, there was in truth some small concern manifested by several of her\ncompany; especially by Radney the mate. He commanded the upper sails to be well\nhoisted, sheeted home anew, and every way expanded to the breeze. Now this\nRadney, I suppose, was as little of a coward, and as little inclined to any sort\nof nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any fearless, unthinking\ncreature on land or on sea that you can conveniently imagine, gentlemen.\nTherefore when he betrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship, some of\nthe seamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part owner in\nher. So when they were working that evening at the pumps, there was on this head\nno small gamesomeness slily going on among them, as they stood with their feet\ncontinually overflowed by the rippling clear water; clear as any mountain\nspring, gentlemen—that bubbling from the pumps ran across the deck, and poured\nitself out in steady spouts at the lee scupper-holes.\n\n“Now, as you well know, it is not seldom the case in this conventional world of\nours—watery or otherwise; that when a person placed in command over his\nfellow-men finds one of them to be very significantly his superior in general\npride of manhood, straightway against that man he conceives an unconquerable\ndislike and bitterness; and if he have a chance he will pull down and pulverize\nthat subaltern’s tower, and make a little heap of dust of it. Be this conceit of\nmine as it may, gentlemen, at all events Steelkilt was a tall and noble animal\nwith a head like a Roman, and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled housings\nof your last viceroy’s snorting charger; and a brain, and a heart, and a soul in\nhim, gentlemen, which had made Steelkilt Charlemagne, had he been born son to\nCharlemagne’s father. But Radney, the mate, was ugly as a mule; yet as hardy, as\nstubborn, as malicious. He did not love Steelkilt, and Steelkilt knew it.\n\n“Espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the rest, the\nLakeman affected not to notice him, but unawed, went on with his gay banterings.\n\n“‘Aye, aye, my merry lads, it’s a lively leak this; hold a cannikin, one of ye,\nand let’s have a taste. By the Lord, it’s worth bottling! I tell ye what, men,\nold Rad’s investment must go for it! he had best cut away his part of the hull\nand tow it home. The fact is, boys, that sword-fish only began the job; he’s\ncome back again with a gang of ship-carpenters, saw-fish, and file-fish, and\nwhat not; and the whole posse of ’em are now hard at work cutting and slashing\nat the bottom; making improvements, I suppose. If old Rad were here now, I’d\ntell him to jump overboard and scatter ’em. They’re playing the devil with his\nestate, I can tell him. But he’s a simple old soul,—Rad, and a beauty too. Boys,\nthey say the rest of his property is invested in looking-glasses. I wonder if\nhe’d give a poor devil like me the model of his nose.’\n\n“‘Damn your eyes! what’s that pump stopping for?’ roared Radney, pretending not\nto have heard the sailors’ talk. ‘Thunder away at it!’\n\n“‘Aye, aye, sir,’ said Steelkilt, merry as a cricket. ‘Lively, boys, lively,\nnow!’ And with that the pump clanged like fifty fire-engines; the men tossed\ntheir hats off to it, and ere long that peculiar gasping of the lungs was heard\nwhich denotes the fullest tension of life’s utmost energies.\n\n“Quitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the Lakeman went forward\nall panting, and sat himself down on the windlass; his face fiery red, his eyes\nbloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat from his brow. Now what cozening fiend\nit was, gentlemen, that possessed Radney to meddle with such a man in that\ncorporeally exasperated state, I know not; but so it happened. Intolerably\nstriding along the deck, the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down\nthe planks, and also a shovel, and remove some offensive matters consequent upon\nallowing a pig to run at large.\n\n“Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship’s deck at sea is a piece of household work\nwhich in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every evening; it\nhas been known to be done in the case of ships actually foundering at the time.\nSuch, gentlemen, is the inflexibility of sea-usages and the instinctive love of\nneatness in seamen; some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing\ntheir faces. But in all vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province\nof the boys, if boys there be aboard. Besides, it was the stronger men in the\nTown-Ho that had been divided into gangs, taking turns at the pumps; and being\nthe most athletic seaman of them all, Steelkilt had been regularly assigned\ncaptain of one of the gangs; consequently he should have been freed from any\ntrivial business not connected with truly nautical duties, such being the case\nwith his comrades. I mention all these particulars so that you may understand\nexactly how this affair stood between the two men.\n\n“But there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost as plainly\nmeant to sting and insult Steelkilt, as though Radney had spat in his face. Any\nman who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will understand this; and all this and\ndoubtless much more, the Lakeman fully comprehended when the mate uttered his\ncommand. But as he sat still for a moment, and as he steadfastly looked into the\nmate’s malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in him\nand the slow-match silently burning along towards them; as he instinctively saw\nall this, that strange forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deeper\npassionateness in any already ireful being—a repugnance most felt, when felt at\nall, by really valiant men even when aggrieved—this nameless phantom feeling,\ngentlemen, stole over Steelkilt.\n\n“Therefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily exhaustion\nhe was temporarily in, he answered him saying that sweeping the deck was not his\nbusiness, and he would not do it. And then, without at all alluding to the\nshovel, he pointed to three lads as the customary sweepers; who, not being\nbilleted at the pumps, had done little or nothing all day. To this, Radney\nreplied with an oath, in a most domineering and outrageous manner\nunconditionally reiterating his command; meanwhile advancing upon the still\nseated Lakeman, with an uplifted cooper’s club hammer which he had snatched from\na cask near by.\n\n“Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps, for all his\nfirst nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating Steelkilt could but ill brook\nthis bearing in the mate; but somehow still smothering the conflagration within\nhim, without speaking he remained doggedly rooted to his seat, till at last the\nincensed Radney shook the hammer within a few inches of his face, furiously\ncommanding him to do his bidding.\n\n“Steelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily followed by\nthe mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately repeated his intention not to\nobey. Seeing, however, that his forbearance had not the slightest effect, by an\nawful and unspeakable intimation with his twisted hand he warned off the foolish\nand infatuated man; but it was to no purpose. And in this way the two went once\nslowly round the windlass; when, resolved at last no longer to retreat,\nbethinking him that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor, the\nLakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer:\n\n“‘Mr. Radney, I will not obey you. Take that hammer away, or look to yourself.’\nBut the predestinated mate coming still closer to him, where the Lakeman stood\nfixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of his teeth; meanwhile\nrepeating a string of insufferable maledictions. Retreating not the thousandth\npart of an inch; stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poniard of his\nglance, Steelkilt, clenching his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it\nback, told his persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he (Steelkilt)\nwould murder him. But, gentlemen, the fool had been branded for the slaughter by\nthe gods. Immediately the hammer touched the cheek; the next instant the lower\njaw of the mate was stove in his head; he fell on the hatch spouting blood like\na whale.\n\n“Ere the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays leading far\naloft to where two of his comrades were standing their mastheads. They were both\nCanallers.\n\n“‘Canallers!’ cried Don Pedro. ‘We have seen many whale-ships in our harbours,\nbut never heard of your Canallers. Pardon: who and what are they?’\n\n“‘Canallers, Don, are the boatmen belonging to our grand Erie Canal. You must\nhave heard of it.’\n\n“‘Nay, Senor; hereabouts in this dull, warm, most lazy, and hereditary land, we\nknow but little of your vigorous North.’\n\n“‘Aye? Well then, Don, refill my cup. Your chicha’s very fine; and ere\nproceeding further I will tell ye what our Canallers are; for such information\nmay throw side-light upon my story.’\n\n“For three hundred and sixty miles, gentlemen, through the entire breadth of the\nstate of New York; through numerous populous cities and most thriving villages;\nthrough long, dismal, uninhabited swamps, and affluent, cultivated fields,\nunrivalled for fertility; by billiard-room and bar-room; through the\nholy-of-holies of great forests; on Roman arches over Indian rivers; through sun\nand shade; by happy hearts or broken; through all the wide contrasting scenery\nof those noble Mohawk counties; and especially, by rows of snow-white chapels,\nwhose spires stand almost like milestones, flows one continual stream of\nVenetianly corrupt and often lawless life. There’s your true Ashantee,\ngentlemen; there howl your pagans; where you ever find them, next door to you;\nunder the long-flung shadow, and the snug patronising lee of churches. For by\nsome curious fatality, as it is often noted of your metropolitan freebooters\nthat they ever encamp around the halls of justice, so sinners, gentlemen, most\nabound in holiest vicinities.\n\n“‘Is that a friar passing?’ said Don Pedro, looking downwards into the crowded\nplazza, with humorous concern.\n\n“‘Well for our northern friend, Dame Isabella’s Inquisition wanes in Lima,’\nlaughed Don Sebastian. ‘Proceed, Senor.’\n\n“‘A moment! Pardon!’ cried another of the company. ‘In the name of all us\nLimeese, I but desire to express to you, sir sailor, that we have by no means\noverlooked your delicacy in not substituting present Lima for distant Venice in\nyour corrupt comparison. Oh! do not bow and look surprised; you know the proverb\nall along this coast—“Corrupt as Lima.” It but bears out your saying, too;\nchurches more plentiful than billiard-tables, and for ever open—and “Corrupt as\nLima.” So, too, Venice; I have been there; the holy city of the blessed\nevangelist, St. Mark!—St. Dominic, purge it! Your cup! Thanks: here I refill;\nnow, you pour out again.’\n\n“Freely depicted in his own vocation, gentlemen, the Canaller would make a fine\ndramatic hero, so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is he. Like Mark Antony,\nfor days and days along his green-turfed, flowery Nile, he indolently floats,\nopenly toying with his red-cheeked Cleopatra, ripening his apricot thigh upon\nthe sunny deck. But ashore, all this effeminacy is dashed. The brigandish guise\nwhich the Canaller so proudly sports; his slouched and gaily-ribboned hat\nbetoken his grand features. A terror to the smiling innocence of the villages\nthrough which he floats; his swart visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in\ncities. Once a vagabond on his own canal, I have received good turns from one of\nthese Canallers; I thank him heartily; would fain be not ungrateful; but it is\noften one of the prime redeeming qualities of your man of violence, that at\ntimes he has as stiff an arm to back a poor stranger in a strait, as to plunder\na wealthy one. In sum, gentlemen, what the wildness of this canal life is, is\nemphatically evinced by this; that our wild whale-fishery contains so many of\nits most finished graduates, and that scarce any race of mankind, except Sydney\nmen, are so much distrusted by our whaling captains. Nor does it at all diminish\nthe curiousness of this matter, that to many thousands of our rural boys and\nyoung men born along its line, the probationary life of the Grand Canal\nfurnishes the sole transition between quietly reaping in a Christian corn-field,\nand recklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas.\n\n“‘I see! I see!’ impetuously exclaimed Don Pedro, spilling his chicha upon his\nsilvery ruffles. ‘No need to travel! The world’s one Lima. I had thought, now,\nthat at your temperate North the generations were cold and holy as the\nhills.—But the story.’\n\n“I left off, gentlemen, where the Lakeman shook the backstay. Hardly had he done\nso, when he was surrounded by the three junior mates and the four harpooneers,\nwho all crowded him to the deck. But sliding down the ropes like baleful comets,\nthe two Canallers rushed into the uproar, and sought to drag their man out of it\ntowards the forecastle. Others of the sailors joined with them in this attempt,\nand a twisted turmoil ensued; while standing out of harm’s way, the valiant\ncaptain danced up and down with a whale-pike, calling upon his officers to\nmanhandle that atrocious scoundrel, and smoke him along to the quarter-deck. At\nintervals, he ran close up to the revolving border of the confusion, and prying\ninto the heart of it with his pike, sought to prick out the object of his\nresentment. But Steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them all; they\nsucceeded in gaining the forecastle deck, where, hastily slewing about three or\nfour large casks in a line with the windlass, these sea-Parisians entrenched\nthemselves behind the barricade.\n\n“‘Come out of that, ye pirates!’ roared the captain, now menacing them with a\npistol in each hand, just brought to him by the steward. ‘Come out of that, ye\ncut-throats!’\n\n“Steelkilt leaped on the barricade, and striding up and down there, defied the\nworst the pistols could do; but gave the captain to understand distinctly, that\nhis (Steelkilt’s) death would be the signal for a murderous mutiny on the part\nof all hands. Fearing in his heart lest this might prove but too true, the\ncaptain a little desisted, but still commanded the insurgents instantly to\nreturn to their duty.\n\n“‘Will you promise not to touch us, if we do?’ demanded their ringleader.\n\n“‘Turn to! turn to!—I make no promise;—to your duty! Do you want to sink the\nship, by knocking off at a time like this? Turn to!’ and he once more raised a\npistol.\n\n“‘Sink the ship?’ cried Steelkilt. ‘Aye, let her sink. Not a man of us turns to,\nunless you swear not to raise a rope-yarn against us. What say ye, men?’ turning\nto his comrades. A fierce cheer was their response.\n\n“The Lakeman now patrolled the barricade, all the while keeping his eye on the\nCaptain, and jerking out such sentences as these:—‘It’s not our fault; we didn’t\nwant it; I told him to take his hammer away; it was boy’s business; he might\nhave known me before this; I told him not to prick the buffalo; I believe I have\nbroken a finger here against his cursed jaw; ain’t those mincing knives down in\nthe forecastle there, men? look to those handspikes, my hearties. Captain, by\nGod, look to yourself; say the word; don’t be a fool; forget it all; we are\nready to turn to; treat us decently, and we’re your men; but we won’t be\nflogged.’\n\n“‘Turn to! I make no promises, turn to, I say!’\n\n“‘Look ye, now,’ cried the Lakeman, flinging out his arm towards him, ‘there are\na few of us here (and I am one of them) who have shipped for the cruise, d’ye\nsee; now as you well know, sir, we can claim our discharge as soon as the anchor\nis down; so we don’t want a row; it’s not our interest; we want to be peaceable;\nwe are ready to work, but we won’t be flogged.’\n\n“‘Turn to!’ roared the Captain.\n\n“Steelkilt glanced round him a moment, and then said:—‘I tell you what it is\nnow, Captain, rather than kill ye, and be hung for such a shabby rascal, we\nwon’t lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us; but till you say the word\nabout not flogging us, we don’t do a hand’s turn.’\n\n“‘Down into the forecastle then, down with ye, I’ll keep ye there till ye’re\nsick of it. Down ye go.’\n\n“‘Shall we?’ cried the ringleader to his men. Most of them were against it; but\nat length, in obedience to Steelkilt, they preceded him down into their dark\nden, growlingly disappearing, like bears into a cave.\n\n“As the Lakeman’s bare head was just level with the planks, the Captain and his\nposse leaped the barricade, and rapidly drawing over the slide of the scuttle,\nplanted their group of hands upon it, and loudly called for the steward to bring\nthe heavy brass padlock belonging to the companionway. Then opening the slide a\nlittle, the Captain whispered something down the crack, closed it, and turned\nthe key upon them—ten in number—leaving on deck some twenty or more, who thus\nfar had remained neutral.\n\n“All night a wide-awake watch was kept by all the officers, forward and aft,\nespecially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway; at which last place\nit was feared the insurgents might emerge, after breaking through the bulkhead\nbelow. But the hours of darkness passed in peace; the men who still remained at\ntheir duty toiling hard at the pumps, whose clinking and clanking at intervals\nthrough the dreary night dismally resounded through the ship.\n\n“At sunrise the Captain went forward, and knocking on the deck, summoned the\nprisoners to work; but with a yell they refused. Water was then lowered down to\nthem, and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were tossed after it; when again\nturning the key upon them and pocketing it, the Captain returned to the\nquarter-deck. Twice every day for three days this was repeated; but on the\nfourth morning a confused wrangling, and then a scuffling was heard, as the\ncustomary summons was delivered; and suddenly four men burst up from the\nforecastle, saying they were ready to turn to. The fetid closeness of the air,\nand a famishing diet, united perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution, had\nconstrained them to surrender at discretion. Emboldened by this, the Captain\nreiterated his demand to the rest, but Steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific\nhint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he belonged. On the fifth\nmorning three others of the mutineers bolted up into the air from the desperate\narms below that sought to restrain them. Only three were left.\n\n“‘Better turn to, now?’ said the Captain with a heartless jeer.\n\n“‘Shut us up again, will ye!’ cried Steelkilt.\n\n“‘Oh certainly,’ said the Captain, and the key clicked.\n\n“It was at this point, gentlemen, that enraged by the defection of seven of his\nformer associates, and stung by the mocking voice that had last hailed him, and\nmaddened by his long entombment in a place as black as the bowels of despair; it\nwas then that Steelkilt proposed to the two Canallers, thus far apparently of\none mind with him, to burst out of their hole at the next summoning of the\ngarrison; and armed with their keen mincing knives (long, crescentic, heavy\nimplements with a handle at each end) run amuck from the bowsprit to the\ntaffrail; and if by any devilishness of desperation possible, seize the ship.\nFor himself, he would do this, he said, whether they joined him or not. That was\nthe last night he should spend in that den. But the scheme met with no\nopposition on the part of the other two; they swore they were ready for that, or\nfor any other mad thing, for anything in short but a surrender. And what was\nmore, they each insisted upon being the first man on deck, when the time to make\nthe rush should come. But to this their leader as fiercely objected, reserving\nthat priority for himself; particularly as his two comrades would not yield, the\none to the other, in the matter; and both of them could not be first, for the\nladder would but admit one man at a time. And here, gentlemen, the foul play of\nthese miscreants must come out.\n\n“Upon hearing the frantic project of their leader, each in his own separate soul\nhad suddenly lighted, it would seem, upon the same piece of treachery, namely:\nto be foremost in breaking out, in order to be the first of the three, though\nthe last of the ten, to surrender; and thereby secure whatever small chance of\npardon such conduct might merit. But when Steelkilt made known his determination\nstill to lead them to the last, they in some way, by some subtle chemistry of\nvillany, mixed their before secret treacheries together; and when their leader\nfell into a doze, verbally opened their souls to each other in three sentences;\nand bound the sleeper with cords, and gagged him with cords; and shrieked out\nfor the Captain at midnight.\n\n“Thinking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark for the blood, he and all his\narmed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle. In a few minutes the\nscuttle was opened, and, bound hand and foot, the still struggling ringleader\nwas shoved up into the air by his perfidious allies, who at once claimed the\nhonor of securing a man who had been fully ripe for murder. But all these were\ncollared, and dragged along the deck like dead cattle; and, side by side, were\nseized up into the mizzen rigging, like three quarters of meat, and there they\nhung till morning. ‘Damn ye,’ cried the Captain, pacing to and fro before them,\n‘the vultures would not touch ye, ye villains!’\n\n“At sunrise he summoned all hands; and separating those who had rebelled from\nthose who had taken no part in the mutiny, he told the former that he had a good\nmind to flog them all round—thought, upon the whole, he would do so—he ought\nto—justice demanded it; but for the present, considering their timely surrender,\nhe would let them go with a reprimand, which he accordingly administered in the\nvernacular.\n\n“‘But as for you, ye carrion rogues,’ turning to the three men in the\nrigging—‘for you, I mean to mince ye up for the try-pots;’ and, seizing a rope,\nhe applied it with all his might to the backs of the two traitors, till they\nyelled no more, but lifelessly hung their heads sideways, as the two crucified\nthieves are drawn.\n\n“‘My wrist is sprained with ye!’ he cried, at last; ‘but there is still rope\nenough left for you, my fine bantam, that wouldn’t give up. Take that gag from\nhis mouth, and let us hear what he can say for himself.’\n\n“For a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his cramped\njaws, and then painfully twisting round his head, said in a sort of hiss, ‘What\nI say is this—and mind it well—if you flog me, I murder you!’\n\n“‘Say ye so? then see how ye frighten me’—and the Captain drew off with the rope\nto strike.\n\n“‘Best not,’ hissed the Lakeman.\n\n“‘But I must,’—and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke.\n\n“Steelkilt here hissed out something, inaudible to all but the Captain; who, to\nthe amazement of all hands, started back, paced the deck rapidly two or three\ntimes, and then suddenly throwing down his rope, said, ‘I won’t do it—let him\ngo—cut him down: d’ye hear?’\n\n“But as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order, a pale man, with a\nbandaged head, arrested them—Radney the chief mate. Ever since the blow, he had\nlain in his berth; but that morning, hearing the tumult on the deck, he had\ncrept out, and thus far had watched the whole scene. Such was the state of his\nmouth, that he could hardly speak; but mumbling something about his being\nwilling and able to do what the captain dared not attempt, he snatched the rope\nand advanced to his pinioned foe.\n\n“‘You are a coward!’ hissed the Lakeman.\n\n“‘So I am, but take that.’ The mate was in the very act of striking, when\nanother hiss stayed his uplifted arm. He paused: and then pausing no more, made\ngood his word, spite of Steelkilt’s threat, whatever that might have been. The\nthree men were then cut down, all hands were turned to, and, sullenly worked by\nthe moody seamen, the iron pumps clanged as before.\n\n“Just after dark that day, when one watch had retired below, a clamor was heard\nin the forecastle; and the two trembling traitors running up, besieged the cabin\ndoor, saying they durst not consort with the crew. Entreaties, cuffs, and kicks\ncould not drive them back, so at their own instance they were put down in the\nship’s run for salvation. Still, no sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest. On\nthe contrary, it seemed, that mainly at Steelkilt’s instigation, they had\nresolved to maintain the strictest peacefulness, obey all orders to the last,\nand, when the ship reached port, desert her in a body. But in order to insure\nthe speediest end to the voyage, they all agreed to another thing—namely, not to\nsing out for whales, in case any should be discovered. For, spite of her leak,\nand spite of all her other perils, the Town-Ho still maintained her mast-heads,\nand her captain was just as willing to lower for a fish that moment, as on the\nday his craft first struck the cruising ground; and Radney the mate was quite as\nready to change his berth for a boat, and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in\ndeath the vital jaw of the whale.\n\n“But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of passiveness\nin their conduct, he kept his own counsel (at least till all was over)\nconcerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who had stung him in\nthe ventricles of his heart. He was in Radney the chief mate’s watch; and as if\nthe infatuated man sought to run more than half way to meet his doom, after the\nscene at the rigging, he insisted, against the express counsel of the captain,\nupon resuming the head of his watch at night. Upon this, and one or two other\ncircumstances, Steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge.\n\n“During the night, Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the bulwarks of\nthe quarter-deck, and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of the boat which was\nhoisted up there, a little above the ship’s side. In this attitude, it was well\nknown, he sometimes dozed. There was a considerable vacancy between the boat and\nthe ship, and down between this was the sea. Steelkilt calculated his time, and\nfound that his next trick at the helm would come round at two o’clock, in the\nmorning of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed. At his\nleisure, he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully in his\nwatches below.\n\n“‘What are you making there?’ said a shipmate.\n\n“‘What do you think? what does it look like?’\n\n“‘Like a lanyard for your bag; but it’s an odd one, seems to me.’\n\n“‘Yes, rather oddish,’ said the Lakeman, holding it at arm’s length before him;\n‘but I think it will answer. Shipmate, I haven’t enough twine,—have you any?’\n\n“But there was none in the forecastle.\n\n“‘Then I must get some from old Rad;’ and he rose to go aft.\n\n“‘You don’t mean to go a begging to him!’ said a sailor.\n\n“‘Why not? Do you think he won’t do me a turn, when it’s to help himself in the\nend, shipmate?’ and going to the mate, he looked at him quietly, and asked him\nfor some twine to mend his hammock. It was given him—neither twine nor lanyard\nwere seen again; but the next night an iron ball, closely netted, partly rolled\nfrom the pocket of the Lakeman’s monkey jacket, as he was tucking the coat into\nhis hammock for a pillow. Twenty-four hours after, his trick at the silent\nhelm—nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready dug to the\nseaman’s hand—that fatal hour was then to come; and in the fore-ordaining soul\nof Steelkilt, the mate was already stark and stretched as a corpse, with his\nforehead crushed in.\n\n“But, gentlemen, a fool saved the would-be murderer from the bloody deed he had\nplanned. Yet complete revenge he had, and without being the avenger. For by a\nmysterious fatality, Heaven itself seemed to step in to take out of his hands\ninto its own the damning thing he would have done.\n\n“It was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second day, when\nthey were washing down the decks, that a stupid Teneriffe man, drawing water in\nthe main-chains, all at once shouted out, ‘There she rolls! there she rolls!’\nJesu, what a whale! It was Moby Dick.\n\n“‘Moby Dick!’ cried Don Sebastian; ‘St. Dominic! Sir sailor, but do whales have\nchristenings? Whom call you Moby Dick?’\n\n“‘A very white, and famous, and most deadly immortal monster, Don;—but that\nwould be too long a story.’\n\n“‘How? how?’ cried all the young Spaniards, crowding.\n\n“‘Nay, Dons, Dons—nay, nay! I cannot rehearse that now. Let me get more into the\nair, Sirs.’\n\n“‘The chicha! the chicha!’ cried Don Pedro; ‘our vigorous friend looks\nfaint;—fill up his empty glass!’\n\n“No need, gentlemen; one moment, and I proceed.—Now, gentlemen, so suddenly\nperceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the ship—forgetful of the\ncompact among the crew—in the excitement of the moment, the Teneriffe man had\ninstinctively and involuntarily lifted his voice for the monster, though for\nsome little time past it had been plainly beheld from the three sullen\nmast-heads. All was now a phrensy. ‘The White Whale—the White Whale!’ was the\ncry from captain, mates, and harpooneers, who, undeterred by fearful rumours,\nwere all anxious to capture so famous and precious a fish; while the dogged crew\neyed askance, and with curses, the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass, that\nlit up by a horizontal spangling sun, shifted and glistened like a living opal\nin the blue morning sea. Gentlemen, a strange fatality pervades the whole career\nof these events, as if verily mapped out before the world itself was charted.\nThe mutineer was the bowsman of the mate, and when fast to a fish, it was his\nduty to sit next him, while Radney stood up with his lance in the prow, and haul\nin or slacken the line, at the word of command. Moreover, when the four boats\nwere lowered, the mate’s got the start; and none howled more fiercely with\ndelight than did Steelkilt, as he strained at his oar. After a stiff pull, their\nharpooneer got fast, and, spear in hand, Radney sprang to the bow. He was always\na furious man, it seems, in a boat. And now his bandaged cry was, to beach him\non the whale’s topmost back. Nothing loath, his bowsman hauled him up and up,\nthrough a blinding foam that blent two whitenesses together; till of a sudden\nthe boat struck as against a sunken ledge, and keeling over, spilled out the\nstanding mate. That instant, as he fell on the whale’s slippery back, the boat\nrighted, and was dashed aside by the swell, while Radney was tossed over into\nthe sea, on the other flank of the whale. He struck out through the spray, and,\nfor an instant, was dimly seen through that veil, wildly seeking to remove\nhimself from the eye of Moby Dick. But the whale rushed round in a sudden\nmaelstrom; seized the swimmer between his jaws; and rearing high up with him,\nplunged headlong again, and went down.\n\n“Meantime, at the first tap of the boat’s bottom, the Lakeman had slackened the\nline, so as to drop astern from the whirlpool; calmly looking on, he thought his\nown thoughts. But a sudden, terrific, downward jerking of the boat, quickly\nbrought his knife to the line. He cut it; and the whale was free. But, at some\ndistance, Moby Dick rose again, with some tatters of Radney’s red woollen shirt,\ncaught in the teeth that had destroyed him. All four boats gave chase again; but\nthe whale eluded them, and finally wholly disappeared.\n\n“In good time, the Town-Ho reached her port—a savage, solitary place—where no\ncivilized creature resided. There, headed by the Lakeman, all but five or six of\nthe foremastmen deliberately deserted among the palms; eventually, as it turned\nout, seizing a large double war-canoe of the savages, and setting sail for some\nother harbor.\n\n“The ship’s company being reduced to but a handful, the captain called upon the\nIslanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving down the ship to\nstop the leak. But to such unresting vigilance over their dangerous allies was\nthis small band of whites necessitated, both by night and by day, and so extreme\nwas the hard work they underwent, that upon the vessel being ready again for\nsea, they were in such a weakened condition that the captain durst not put off\nwith them in so heavy a vessel. After taking counsel with his officers, he\nanchored the ship as far off shore as possible; loaded and ran out his two\ncannon from the bows; stacked his muskets on the poop; and warning the Islanders\nnot to approach the ship at their peril, took one man with him, and setting the\nsail of his best whale-boat, steered straight before the wind for Tahiti, five\nhundred miles distant, to procure a reinforcement to his crew.\n\n“On the fourth day of the sail, a large canoe was descried, which seemed to have\ntouched at a low isle of corals. He steered away from it; but the savage craft\nbore down on him; and soon the voice of Steelkilt hailed him to heave to, or he\nwould run him under water. The captain presented a pistol. With one foot on each\nprow of the yoked war-canoes, the Lakeman laughed him to scorn; assuring him\nthat if the pistol so much as clicked in the lock, he would bury him in bubbles\nand foam.\n\n“‘What do you want of me?’ cried the captain.\n\n“‘Where are you bound? and for what are you bound?’ demanded Steelkilt; ‘no\nlies.’\n\n“‘I am bound to Tahiti for more men.’\n\n“‘Very good. Let me board you a moment—I come in peace.’ With that he leaped\nfrom the canoe, swam to the boat; and climbing the gunwale, stood face to face\nwith the captain.\n\n“‘Cross your arms, sir; throw back your head. Now, repeat after me. As soon as\nSteelkilt leaves me, I swear to beach this boat on yonder island, and remain\nthere six days. If I do not, may lightnings strike me!’\n\n“‘A pretty scholar,’ laughed the Lakeman. ‘Adios, Senor!’ and leaping into the\nsea, he swam back to his comrades.\n\n“Watching the boat till it was fairly beached, and drawn up to the roots of the\ncocoa-nut trees, Steelkilt made sail again, and in due time arrived at Tahiti,\nhis own place of destination. There, luck befriended him; two ships were about\nto sail for France, and were providentially in want of precisely that number of\nmen which the sailor headed. They embarked; and so for ever got the start of\ntheir former captain, had he been at all minded to work them legal retribution.\n\n“Some ten days after the French ships sailed, the whale-boat arrived, and the\ncaptain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized Tahitians, who had been\nsomewhat used to the sea. Chartering a small native schooner, he returned with\nthem to his vessel; and finding all right there, again resumed his cruisings.\n\n“Where Steelkilt now is, gentlemen, none know; but upon the island of Nantucket,\nthe widow of Radney still turns to the sea which refuses to give up its dead;\nstill in dreams sees the awful white whale that destroyed him. * * * *\n\n“‘Are you through?’ said Don Sebastian, quietly.\n\n“‘I am, Don.’\n\n“‘Then I entreat you, tell me if to the best of your own convictions, this your\nstory is in substance really true? It is so passing wonderful! Did you get it\nfrom an unquestionable source? Bear with me if I seem to press.’\n\n“‘Also bear with all of us, sir sailor; for we all join in Don Sebastian’s\nsuit,’ cried the company, with exceeding interest.\n\n“‘Is there a copy of the Holy Evangelists in the Golden Inn, gentlemen?’\n\n“‘Nay,’ said Don Sebastian; ‘but I know a worthy priest near by, who will\nquickly procure one for me. I go for it; but are you well advised? this may grow\ntoo serious.’\n\n“‘Will you be so good as to bring the priest also, Don?’\n\n“‘Though there are no Auto-da-Fés in Lima now,’ said one of the company to\nanother; ‘I fear our sailor friend runs risk of the archiepiscopacy. Let us\nwithdraw more out of the moonlight. I see no need of this.’\n\n“‘Excuse me for running after you, Don Sebastian; but may I also beg that you\nwill be particular in procuring the largest sized Evangelists you can.’\n\n* * * * * *\n\n“‘This is the priest, he brings you the Evangelists,’ said Don Sebastian,\ngravely, returning with a tall and solemn figure.\n\n“‘Let me remove my hat. Now, venerable priest, further into the light, and hold\nthe Holy Book before me that I may touch it.\n\n“‘So help me Heaven, and on my honor the story I have told ye, gentlemen, is in\nsubstance and its great items, true. I know it to be true; it happened on this\nball; I trod the ship; I knew the crew; I have seen and talked with Steelkilt\nsince the death of Radney.’”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 55. OF THE MONSTROUS PICTURES OF WHALES.\n\nI shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas, something like\nthe true form of the whale as he actually appears to the eye of the whaleman\nwhen in his own absolute body the whale is moored alongside the whale-ship so\nthat he can be fairly stepped upon there. It may be worth while, therefore,\npreviously to advert to those curious imaginary portraits of him which even down\nto the present day confidently challenge the faith of the landsman. It is time\nto set the world right in this matter, by proving such pictures of the whale all\nwrong.\n\nIt may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will be found\namong the oldest Hindoo, Egyptian, and Grecian sculptures. For ever since those\ninventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble panellings of temples, the\npedestals of statues, and on shields, medallions, cups, and coins, the dolphin\nwas drawn in scales of chain-armor like Saladin’s, and a helmeted head like St.\nGeorge’s; ever since then has something of the same sort of license prevailed,\nnot only in most popular pictures of the whale, but in many scientific\npresentations of him.\n\nNow, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting to be the\nwhale’s, is to be found in the famous cavern-pagoda of Elephanta, in India. The\nBrahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of that immemorial\npagoda, all the trades and pursuits, every conceivable avocation of man, were\nprefigured ages before any of them actually came into being. No wonder then,\nthat in some sort our noble profession of whaling should have been there\nshadowed forth. The Hindoo whale referred to, occurs in a separate department of\nthe wall, depicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the form of leviathan,\nlearnedly known as the Matse Avatar. But though this sculpture is half man and\nhalf whale, so as only to give the tail of the latter, yet that small section of\nhim is all wrong. It looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda, than the\nbroad palms of the true whale’s majestic flukes.\n\nBut go to the old Galleries, and look now at a great Christian painter’s\nportrait of this fish; for he succeeds no better than the antediluvian Hindoo.\nIt is Guido’s picture of Perseus rescuing Andromeda from the sea-monster or\nwhale. Where did Guido get the model of such a strange creature as that? Nor\ndoes Hogarth, in painting the same scene in his own “Perseus Descending,” make\nout one whit better. The huge corpulence of that Hogarthian monster undulates on\nthe surface, scarcely drawing one inch of water. It has a sort of howdah on its\nback, and its distended tusked mouth into which the billows are rolling, might\nbe taken for the Traitors’ Gate leading from the Thames by water into the Tower.\nThen, there are the Prodromus whales of old Scotch Sibbald, and Jonah’s whale,\nas depicted in the prints of old Bibles and the cuts of old primers. What shall\nbe said of these? As for the book-binder’s whale winding like a vine-stalk round\nthe stock of a descending anchor—as stamped and gilded on the backs and\ntitle-pages of many books both old and new—that is a very picturesque but purely\nfabulous creature, imitated, I take it, from the like figures on antique vases.\nThough universally denominated a dolphin, I nevertheless call this book-binder’s\nfish an attempt at a whale; because it was so intended when the device was first\nintroduced. It was introduced by an old Italian publisher somewhere about the\n15th century, during the Revival of Learning; and in those days, and even down\nto a comparatively late period, dolphins were popularly supposed to be a species\nof the Leviathan.\n\nIn the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you will at\ntimes meet with very curious touches at the whale, where all manner of spouts,\njets d’eau, hot springs and cold, Saratoga and Baden-Baden, come bubbling up\nfrom his unexhausted brain. In the title-page of the original edition of the\n“Advancement of Learning” you will find some curious whales.\n\nBut quitting all these unprofessional attempts, let us glance at those pictures\nof leviathan purporting to be sober, scientific delineations, by those who know.\nIn old Harris’s collection of voyages there are some plates of whales extracted\nfrom a Dutch book of voyages, A.D. 1671, entitled “A Whaling Voyage to\nSpitzbergen in the ship Jonas in the Whale, Peter Peterson of Friesland,\nmaster.” In one of those plates the whales, like great rafts of logs, are\nrepresented lying among ice-isles, with white bears running over their living\nbacks. In another plate, the prodigious blunder is made of representing the\nwhale with perpendicular flukes.\n\nThen again, there is an imposing quarto, written by one Captain Colnett, a Post\nCaptain in the English navy, entitled “A Voyage round Cape Horn into the South\nSeas, for the purpose of extending the Spermaceti Whale Fisheries.” In this book\nis an outline purporting to be a “Picture of a Physeter or Spermaceti whale,\ndrawn by scale from one killed on the coast of Mexico, August, 1793, and hoisted\non deck.” I doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for the\nbenefit of his marines. To mention but one thing about it, let me say that it\nhas an eye which applied, according to the accompanying scale, to a full grown\nsperm whale, would make the eye of that whale a bow-window some five feet long.\nAh, my gallant captain, why did ye not give us Jonah looking out of that eye!\n\nNor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for the benefit\nof the young and tender, free from the same heinousness of mistake. Look at that\npopular work “Goldsmith’s Animated Nature.” In the abridged London edition of\n1807, there are plates of an alleged “whale” and a “narwhale.” I do not wish to\nseem inelegant, but this unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow; and,\nas for the narwhale, one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one, that in this\nnineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon any\nintelligent public of schoolboys.\n\nThen, again, in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de Lacépède, a great naturalist,\npublished a scientific systemized whale book, wherein are several pictures of\nthe different species of the Leviathan. All these are not only incorrect, but\nthe picture of the Mysticetus or Greenland whale (that is to say, the Right\nwhale), even Scoresby, a long experienced man as touching that species, declares\nnot to have its counterpart in nature.\n\nBut the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was reserved\nfor the scientific Frederick Cuvier, brother to the famous Baron. In 1836, he\npublished a Natural History of Whales, in which he gives what he calls a picture\nof the Sperm Whale. Before showing that picture to any Nantucketer, you had best\nprovide for your summary retreat from Nantucket. In a word, Frederick Cuvier’s\nSperm Whale is not a Sperm Whale, but a squash. Of course, he never had the\nbenefit of a whaling voyage (such men seldom have), but whence he derived that\npicture, who can tell? Perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor in the\nsame field, Desmarest, got one of his authentic abortions; that is, from a\nChinese drawing. And what sort of lively lads with the pencil those Chinese are,\nmany queer cups and saucers inform us.\n\nAs for the sign-painters’ whales seen in the streets hanging over the shops of\noil-dealers, what shall be said of them? They are generally Richard III. whales,\nwith dromedary humps, and very savage; breakfasting on three or four sailor\ntarts, that is whaleboats full of mariners: their deformities floundering in\nseas of blood and blue paint.\n\nBut these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very surprising\nafter all. Consider! Most of the scientific drawings have been taken from the\nstranded fish; and these are about as correct as a drawing of a wrecked ship,\nwith broken back, would correctly represent the noble animal itself in all its\nundashed pride of hull and spars. Though elephants have stood for their\nfull-lengths, the living Leviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his\nportrait. The living whale, in his full majesty and significance, is only to be\nseen at sea in unfathomable waters; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of\nsight, like a launched line-of-battle ship; and out of that element it is a\nthing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air, so\nas to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations. And, not to speak of the\nhighly presumable difference of contour between a young sucking whale and a\nfull-grown Platonian Leviathan; yet, even in the case of one of those young\nsucking whales hoisted to a ship’s deck, such is then the outlandish, eel-like,\nlimbered, varying shape of him, that his precise expression the devil himself\ncould not catch.\n\nBut it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale,\naccurate hints may be derived touching his true form. Not at all. For it is one\nof the more curious things about this Leviathan, that his skeleton gives very\nlittle idea of his general shape. Though Jeremy Bentham’s skeleton, which hangs\nfor candelabra in the library of one of his executors, correctly conveys the\nidea of a burly-browed utilitarian old gentleman, with all Jeremy’s other\nleading personal characteristics; yet nothing of this kind could be inferred\nfrom any leviathan’s articulated bones. In fact, as the great Hunter says, the\nmere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully invested and\npadded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes\nit. This peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head, as in some part of this\nbook will be incidentally shown. It is also very curiously displayed in the side\nfin, the bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the human hand,\nminus only the thumb. This fin has four regular bone-fingers, the index, middle,\nring, and little finger. But all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy\ncovering, as the human fingers in an artificial covering. “However recklessly\nthe whale may sometimes serve us,” said humorous Stubb one day, “he can never be\ntruly said to handle us without mittens.”\n\nFor all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must needs conclude\nthat the great Leviathan is that one creature in the world which must remain\nunpainted to the last. True, one portrait may hit the mark much nearer than\nanother, but none can hit it with any very considerable degree of exactness. So\nthere is no earthly way of finding out precisely what the whale really looks\nlike. And the only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his\nliving contour, is by going a whaling yourself; but by so doing, you run no\nsmall risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him. Wherefore, it seems to me\nyou had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this Leviathan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 56. OF THE LESS ERRONEOUS PICTURES OF WHALES, AND THE TRUE PICTURES OF\nWHALING SCENES.\n\nIn connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales, I am strongly tempted here\nto enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them which are to be found\nin certain books, both ancient and modern, especially in Pliny, Purchas,\nHackluyt, Harris, Cuvier, etc. But I pass that matter by.\n\nI know of only four published outlines of the great Sperm Whale; Colnett’s,\nHuggins’s, Frederick Cuvier’s, and Beale’s. In the previous chapter Colnett and\nCuvier have been referred to. Huggins’s is far better than theirs; but, by great\nodds, Beale’s is the best. All Beale’s drawings of this whale are good,\nexcepting the middle figure in the picture of three whales in various attitudes,\ncapping his second chapter. His frontispiece, boats attacking Sperm Whales,\nthough no doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men, is\nadmirably correct and life-like in its general effect. Some of the Sperm Whale\ndrawings in J. Ross Browne are pretty correct in contour; but they are\nwretchedly engraved. That is not his fault though.\n\nOf the Right Whale, the best outline pictures are in Scoresby; but they are\ndrawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression. He has but one\npicture of whaling scenes, and this is a sad deficiency, because it is by such\npictures only, when at all well done, that you can derive anything like a\ntruthful idea of the living whale as seen by his living hunters.\n\nBut, taken for all in all, by far the finest, though in some details not the\nmost correct, presentations of whales and whaling scenes to be anywhere found,\nare two large French engravings, well executed, and taken from paintings by one\nGarnery. Respectively, they represent attacks on the Sperm and Right Whale. In\nthe first engraving a noble Sperm Whale is depicted in full majesty of might,\njust risen beneath the boat from the profundities of the ocean, and bearing high\nin the air upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks. The prow of\nthe boat is partially unbroken, and is drawn just balancing upon the monster’s\nspine; and standing in that prow, for that one single incomputable flash of\ntime, you behold an oarsman, half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the\nwhale, and in the act of leaping, as if from a precipice. The action of the\nwhole thing is wonderfully good and true. The half-emptied line-tub floats on\nthe whitened sea; the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it;\nthe heads of the swimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting\nexpressions of affright; while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing\ndown upon the scene. Serious fault might be found with the anatomical details of\nthis whale, but let that pass; since, for the life of me, I could not draw so\ngood a one.\n\nIn the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside the\nbarnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls his black weedy bulk\nin the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the Patagonian cliffs. His jets are\nerect, full, and black like soot; so that from so abounding a smoke in the\nchimney, you would think there must be a brave supper cooking in the great\nbowels below. Sea fowls are pecking at the small crabs, shell-fish, and other\nsea candies and maccaroni, which the Right Whale sometimes carries on his\npestilent back. And all the while the thick-lipped leviathan is rushing through\nthe deep, leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake, and causing the\nslight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught nigh the paddle-wheels of\nan ocean steamer. Thus, the foreground is all raging commotion; but behind, in\nadmirable artistic contrast, is the glassy level of a sea becalmed, the drooping\nunstarched sails of the powerless ship, and the inert mass of a dead whale, a\nconquered fortress, with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the whale-pole\ninserted into his spout-hole.\n\nWho Garnery the painter is, or was, I know not. But my life for it he was either\npractically conversant with his subject, or else marvellously tutored by some\nexperienced whaleman. The French are the lads for painting action. Go and gaze\nupon all the paintings of Europe, and where will you find such a gallery of\nliving and breathing commotion on canvas, as in that triumphal hall at\nVersailles; where the beholder fights his way, pell-mell, through the\nconsecutive great battles of France; where every sword seems a flash of the\nNorthern Lights, and the successive armed kings and Emperors dash by, like a\ncharge of crowned centaurs? Not wholly unworthy of a place in that gallery, are\nthese sea battle-pieces of Garnery.\n\nThe natural aptitude of the French for seizing the picturesqueness of things\nseems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings they have of\ntheir whaling scenes. With not one tenth of England’s experience in the fishery,\nand not the thousandth part of that of the Americans, they have nevertheless\nfurnished both nations with the only finished sketches at all capable of\nconveying the real spirit of the whale hunt. For the most part, the English and\nAmerican whale draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical\noutline of things, such as the vacant profile of the whale; which, so far as\npicturesqueness of effect is concerned, is about tantamount to sketching the\nprofile of a pyramid. Even Scoresby, the justly renowned Right whaleman, after\ngiving us a stiff full length of the Greenland whale, and three or four delicate\nminiatures of narwhales and porpoises, treats us to a series of classical\nengravings of boat hooks, chopping knives, and grapnels; and with the\nmicroscopic diligence of a Leuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a shivering\nworld ninety-six fac-similes of magnified Arctic snow crystals. I mean no\ndisparagement to the excellent voyager (I honor him for a veteran), but in so\nimportant a matter it was certainly an oversight not to have procured for every\ncrystal a sworn affidavit taken before a Greenland Justice of the Peace.\n\nIn addition to those fine engravings from Garnery, there are two other French\nengravings worthy of note, by some one who subscribes himself “H. Durand.” One\nof them, though not precisely adapted to our present purpose, nevertheless\ndeserves mention on other accounts. It is a quiet noon-scene among the isles of\nthe Pacific; a French whaler anchored, inshore, in a calm, and lazily taking\nwater on board; the loosened sails of the ship, and the long leaves of the palms\nin the background, both drooping together in the breezeless air. The effect is\nvery fine, when considered with reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen\nunder one of their few aspects of oriental repose. The other engraving is quite\na different affair: the ship hove-to upon the open sea, and in the very heart of\nthe Leviathanic life, with a Right Whale alongside; the vessel (in the act of\ncutting-in) hove over to the monster as if to a quay; and a boat, hurriedly\npushing off from this scene of activity, is about giving chase to whales in the\ndistance. The harpoons and lances lie levelled for use; three oarsmen are just\nsetting the mast in its hole; while from a sudden roll of the sea, the little\ncraft stands half-erect out of the water, like a rearing horse. From the ship,\nthe smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke over a\nvillage of smithies; and to windward, a black cloud, rising up with earnest of\nsqualls and rains, seems to quicken the activity of the excited seamen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 57. OF WHALES IN PAINT; IN TEETH; IN WOOD; IN SHEET-IRON; IN STONE; IN\nMOUNTAINS; IN STARS.\n\nOn Tower-hill, as you go down to the London docks, you may have seen a crippled\nbeggar (or kedger, as the sailors say) holding a painted board before him,\nrepresenting the tragic scene in which he lost his leg. There are three whales\nand three boats; and one of the boats (presumed to contain the missing leg in\nall its original integrity) is being crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale.\nAny time these ten years, they tell me, has that man held up that picture, and\nexhibited that stump to an incredulous world. But the time of his justification\nhas now come. His three whales are as good whales as were ever published in\nWapping, at any rate; and his stump as unquestionable a stump as any you will\nfind in the western clearings. But, though for ever mounted on that stump, never\na stump-speech does the poor whaleman make; but, with downcast eyes, stands\nruefully contemplating his own amputation.\n\nThroughout the Pacific, and also in Nantucket, and New Bedford, and Sag Harbor,\nyou will come across lively sketches of whales and whaling-scenes, graven by the\nfishermen themselves on Sperm Whale-teeth, or ladies’ busks wrought out of the\nRight Whale-bone, and other like skrimshander articles, as the whalemen call the\nnumerous little ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out of the rough\nmaterial, in their hours of ocean leisure. Some of them have little boxes of\ndentistical-looking implements, specially intended for the skrimshandering\nbusiness. But, in general, they toil with their jack-knives alone; and, with\nthat almost omnipotent tool of the sailor, they will turn you out anything you\nplease, in the way of a mariner’s fancy.\n\nLong exile from Christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man to that\ncondition in which God placed him, i.e. what is called savagery. Your true\nwhale-hunter is as much a savage as an Iroquois. I myself am a savage, owning no\nallegiance but to the King of the Cannibals; and ready at any moment to rebel\nagainst him.\n\nNow, one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic hours, is\nhis wonderful patience of industry. An ancient Hawaiian war-club or\nspear-paddle, in its full multiplicity and elaboration of carving, is as great a\ntrophy of human perseverance as a Latin lexicon. For, with but a bit of broken\nsea-shell or a shark’s tooth, that miraculous intricacy of wooden net-work has\nbeen achieved; and it has cost steady years of steady application.\n\nAs with the Hawaiian savage, so with the white sailor-savage. With the same\nmarvellous patience, and with the same single shark’s tooth, of his one poor\njack-knife, he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture, not quite as workmanlike,\nbut as close packed in its maziness of design, as the Greek savage, Achilles’s\nshield; and full of barbaric spirit and suggestiveness, as the prints of that\nfine old Dutch savage, Albert Durer.\n\nWooden whales, or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs of the noble\nSouth Sea war-wood, are frequently met with in the forecastles of American\nwhalers. Some of them are done with much accuracy.\n\nAt some old gable-roofed country houses you will see brass whales hung by the\ntail for knockers to the road-side door. When the porter is sleepy, the\nanvil-headed whale would be best. But these knocking whales are seldom\nremarkable as faithful essays. On the spires of some old-fashioned churches you\nwill see sheet-iron whales placed there for weather-cocks; but they are so\nelevated, and besides that are to all intents and purposes so labelled with\n“Hands off!” you cannot examine them closely enough to decide upon their merit.\n\nIn bony, ribby regions of the earth, where at the base of high broken cliffs\nmasses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the plain, you will often\ndiscover images as of the petrified forms of the Leviathan partly merged in\ngrass, which of a windy day breaks against them in a surf of green surges.\n\nThen, again, in mountainous countries where the traveller is continually girdled\nby amphitheatrical heights; here and there from some lucky point of view you\nwill catch passing glimpses of the profiles of whales defined along the\nundulating ridges. But you must be a thorough whaleman, to see these sights; and\nnot only that, but if you wish to return to such a sight again, you must be sure\nand take the exact intersecting latitude and longitude of your first\nstand-point, else so chance-like are such observations of the hills, that your\nprecise, previous stand-point would require a laborious re-discovery; like the\nSoloma Islands, which still remain incognita, though once high-ruffed Mendanna\ntrod them and old Figuera chronicled them.\n\nNor when expandingly lifted by your subject, can you fail to trace out great\nwhales in the starry heavens, and boats in pursuit of them; as when long filled\nwith thoughts of war the Eastern nations saw armies locked in battle among the\nclouds. Thus at the North have I chased Leviathan round and round the Pole with\nthe revolutions of the bright points that first defined him to me. And beneath\nthe effulgent Antarctic skies I have boarded the Argo-Navis, and joined the\nchase against the starry Cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of Hydrus and the\nFlying Fish.\n\nWith a frigate’s anchors for my bridle-bitts and fasces of harpoons for spurs,\nwould I could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies, to see whether the\nfabled heavens with all their countless tents really lie encamped beyond my\nmortal sight!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 58. BRIT.\n\nSteering north-eastward from the Crozetts, we fell in with vast meadows of brit,\nthe minute, yellow substance, upon which the Right Whale largely feeds. For\nleagues and leagues it undulated round us, so that we seemed to be sailing\nthrough boundless fields of ripe and golden wheat.\n\nOn the second day, numbers of Right Whales were seen, who, secure from the\nattack of a Sperm Whaler like the Pequod, with open jaws sluggishly swam through\nthe brit, which, adhering to the fringing fibres of that wondrous Venetian blind\nin their mouths, was in that manner separated from the water that escaped at the\nlip.\n\nAs morning mowers, who side by side slowly and seethingly advance their scythes\nthrough the long wet grass of marshy meads; even so these monsters swam, making\na strange, grassy, cutting sound; and leaving behind them endless swaths of blue\nupon the yellow sea.*\n\n*That part of the sea known among whalemen as the “Brazil Banks” does not bear\nthat name as the Banks of Newfoundland do, because of there being shallows and\nsoundings there, but because of this remarkable meadow-like appearance, caused\nby the vast drifts of brit continually floating in those latitudes, where the\nRight Whale is often chased.\n\nBut it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at all\nreminded one of mowers. Seen from the mast-heads, especially when they paused\nand were stationary for a while, their vast black forms looked more like\nlifeless masses of rock than anything else. And as in the great hunting\ncountries of India, the stranger at a distance will sometimes pass on the plains\nrecumbent elephants without knowing them to be such, taking them for bare,\nblackened elevations of the soil; even so, often, with him, who for the first\ntime beholds this species of the leviathans of the sea. And even when recognised\nat last, their immense magnitude renders it very hard really to believe that\nsuch bulky masses of overgrowth can possibly be instinct, in all parts, with the\nsame sort of life that lives in a dog or a horse.\n\nIndeed, in other respects, you can hardly regard any creatures of the deep with\nthe same feelings that you do those of the shore. For though some old\nnaturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are of their kind in\nthe sea; and though taking a broad general view of the thing, this may very well\nbe; yet coming to specialties, where, for example, does the ocean furnish any\nfish that in disposition answers to the sagacious kindness of the dog? The\naccursed shark alone can in any generic respect be said to bear comparative\nanalogy to him.\n\nBut though, to landsmen in general, the native inhabitants of the seas have ever\nbeen regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and repelling; though we know\nthe sea to be an everlasting terra incognita, so that Columbus sailed over\nnumberless unknown worlds to discover his one superficial western one; though,\nby vast odds, the most terrific of all mortal disasters have immemorially and\nindiscriminately befallen tens and hundreds of thousands of those who have gone\nupon the waters; though but a moment’s consideration will teach, that however\nbaby man may brag of his science and skill, and however much, in a flattering\nfuture, that science and skill may augment; yet for ever and for ever, to the\ncrack of doom, the sea will insult and murder him, and pulverize the stateliest,\nstiffest frigate he can make; nevertheless, by the continual repetition of these\nvery impressions, man has lost that sense of the full awfulness of the sea which\naboriginally belongs to it.\n\nThe first boat we read of, floated on an ocean, that with Portuguese vengeance\nhad whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow. That same ocean\nrolls now; that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships of last year. Yea,\nfoolish mortals, Noah’s flood is not yet subsided; two thirds of the fair world\nit yet covers.\n\nWherein differ the sea and the land, that a miracle upon one is not a miracle\nupon the other? Preternatural terrors rested upon the Hebrews, when under the\nfeet of Korah and his company the live ground opened and swallowed them up for\never; yet not a modern sun ever sets, but in precisely the same manner the live\nsea swallows up ships and crews.\n\nBut not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it, but it is also\na fiend to its own off-spring; worse than the Persian host who murdered his own\nguests; sparing not the creatures which itself hath spawned. Like a savage\ntigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her own cubs, so the sea dashes even\nthe mightiest whales against the rocks, and leaves them there side by side with\nthe split wrecks of ships. No mercy, no power but its own controls it. Panting\nand snorting like a mad battle steed that has lost its rider, the masterless\nocean overruns the globe.\n\nConsider the subtleness of the sea; how its most dreaded creatures glide under\nwater, unapparent for the most part, and treacherously hidden beneath the\nloveliest tints of azure. Consider also the devilish brilliance and beauty of\nmany of its most remorseless tribes, as the dainty embellished shape of many\nspecies of sharks. Consider, once more, the universal cannibalism of the sea;\nall whose creatures prey upon each other, carrying on eternal war since the\nworld began.\n\nConsider all this; and then turn to this green, gentle, and most docile earth;\nconsider them both, the sea and the land; and do you not find a strange analogy\nto something in yourself? For as this appalling ocean surrounds the verdant\nland, so in the soul of man there lies one insular Tahiti, full of peace and\njoy, but encompassed by all the horrors of the half known life. God keep thee!\nPush not off from that isle, thou canst never return!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 59. SQUID.\n\nSlowly wading through the meadows of brit, the Pequod still held on her way\nnorth-eastward towards the island of Java; a gentle air impelling her keel, so\nthat in the surrounding serenity her three tall tapering masts mildly waved to\nthat languid breeze, as three mild palms on a plain. And still, at wide\nintervals in the silvery night, the lonely, alluring jet would be seen.\n\nBut one transparent blue morning, when a stillness almost preternatural spread\nover the sea, however unattended with any stagnant calm; when the long burnished\nsun-glade on the waters seemed a golden finger laid across them, enjoining some\nsecrecy; when the slippered waves whispered together as they softly ran on; in\nthis profound hush of the visible sphere a strange spectre was seen by Daggoo\nfrom the main-mast-head.\n\nIn the distance, a great white mass lazily rose, and rising higher and higher,\nand disentangling itself from the azure, at last gleamed before our prow like a\nsnow-slide, new slid from the hills. Thus glistening for a moment, as slowly it\nsubsided, and sank. Then once more arose, and silently gleamed. It seemed not a\nwhale; and yet is this Moby Dick? thought Daggoo. Again the phantom went down,\nbut on re-appearing once more, with a stiletto-like cry that startled every man\nfrom his nod, the negro yelled out—“There! there again! there she breaches!\nright ahead! The White Whale, the White Whale!”\n\nUpon this, the seamen rushed to the yard-arms, as in swarming-time the bees rush\nto the boughs. Bare-headed in the sultry sun, Ahab stood on the bowsprit, and\nwith one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave his orders to the helmsman,\ncast his eager glance in the direction indicated aloft by the outstretched\nmotionless arm of Daggoo.\n\nWhether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet had gradually\nworked upon Ahab, so that he was now prepared to connect the ideas of mildness\nand repose with the first sight of the particular whale he pursued; however this\nwas, or whether his eagerness betrayed him; whichever way it might have been, no\nsooner did he distinctly perceive the white mass, than with a quick intensity he\ninstantly gave orders for lowering.\n\nThe four boats were soon on the water; Ahab’s in advance, and all swiftly\npulling towards their prey. Soon it went down, and while, with oars suspended,\nwe were awaiting its reappearance, lo! in the same spot where it sank, once more\nit slowly rose. Almost forgetting for the moment all thoughts of Moby Dick, we\nnow gazed at the most wondrous phenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto\nrevealed to mankind. A vast pulpy mass, furlongs in length and breadth, of a\nglancing cream-colour, lay floating on the water, innumerable long arms\nradiating from its centre, and curling and twisting like a nest of anacondas, as\nif blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach. No perceptible face or\nfront did it have; no conceivable token of either sensation or instinct; but\nundulated there on the billows, an unearthly, formless, chance-like apparition\nof life.\n\nAs with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again, Starbuck still gazing\nat the agitated waters where it had sunk, with a wild voice exclaimed—“Almost\nrather had I seen Moby Dick and fought him, than to have seen thee, thou white\nghost!”\n\n“What was it, Sir?” said Flask.\n\n“The great live squid, which, they say, few whale-ships ever beheld, and\nreturned to their ports to tell of it.”\n\nBut Ahab said nothing; turning his boat, he sailed back to the vessel; the rest\nas silently following.\n\nWhatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected with the\nsight of this object, certain it is, that a glimpse of it being so very unusual,\nthat circumstance has gone far to invest it with portentousness. So rarely is it\nbeheld, that though one and all of them declare it to be the largest animated\nthing in the ocean, yet very few of them have any but the most vague ideas\nconcerning its true nature and form; notwithstanding, they believe it to furnish\nto the sperm whale his only food. For though other species of whales find their\nfood above water, and may be seen by man in the act of feeding, the spermaceti\nwhale obtains his whole food in unknown zones below the surface; and only by\ninference is it that any one can tell of what, precisely, that food consists. At\ntimes, when closely pursued, he will disgorge what are supposed to be the\ndetached arms of the squid; some of them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and\nthirty feet in length. They fancy that the monster to which these arms belonged\nordinarily clings by them to the bed of the ocean; and that the sperm whale,\nunlike other species, is supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it.\n\nThere seems some ground to imagine that the great Kraken of Bishop Pontoppodan\nmay ultimately resolve itself into Squid. The manner in which the Bishop\ndescribes it, as alternately rising and sinking, with some other particulars he\nnarrates, in all this the two correspond. But much abatement is necessary with\nrespect to the incredible bulk he assigns it.\n\nBy some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious creature,\nhere spoken of, it is included among the class of cuttle-fish, to which, indeed,\nin certain external respects it would seem to belong, but only as the Anak of\nthe tribe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 60. THE LINE.\n\nWith reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described, as well as for the\nbetter understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented, I have here to\nspeak of the magical, sometimes horrible whale-line.\n\nThe line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp, slightly vapored\nwith tar, not impregnated with it, as in the case of ordinary ropes; for while\ntar, as ordinarily used, makes the hemp more pliable to the rope-maker, and also\nrenders the rope itself more convenient to the sailor for common ship use; yet,\nnot only would the ordinary quantity too much stiffen the whale-line for the\nclose coiling to which it must be subjected; but as most seamen are beginning to\nlearn, tar in general by no means adds to the rope’s durability or strength,\nhowever much it may give it compactness and gloss.\n\nOf late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost entirely\nsuperseded hemp as a material for whale-lines; for, though not so durable as\nhemp, it is stronger, and far more soft and elastic; and I will add (since there\nis an æsthetics in all things), is much more handsome and becoming to the boat,\nthan hemp. Hemp is a dusky, dark fellow, a sort of Indian; but Manilla is as a\ngolden-haired Circassian to behold.\n\nThe whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness. At first sight, you\nwould not think it so strong as it really is. By experiment its one and fifty\nyarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and twenty pounds; so that the\nwhole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three tons. In length, the common\nsperm whale-line measures something over two hundred fathoms. Towards the stern\nof the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub, not like the worm-pipe of a\nstill though, but so as to form one round, cheese-shaped mass of densely bedded\n“sheaves,” or layers of concentric spiralizations, without any hollow but the\n“heart,” or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese. As the least\ntangle or kink in the coiling would, in running out, infallibly take somebody’s\narm, leg, or entire body off, the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line\nin its tub. Some harpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this\nbusiness, carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through a\nblock towards the tub, so as in the act of coiling to free it from all possible\nwrinkles and twists.\n\nIn the English boats two tubs are used instead of one; the same line being\ncontinuously coiled in both tubs. There is some advantage in this; because these\ntwin-tubs being so small they fit more readily into the boat, and do not strain\nit so much; whereas, the American tub, nearly three feet in diameter and of\nproportionate depth, makes a rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are\nbut one half-inch in thickness; for the bottom of the whale-boat is like\ncritical ice, which will bear up a considerable distributed weight, but not very\nmuch of a concentrated one. When the painted canvas cover is clapped on the\nAmerican line-tub, the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a prodigious\ngreat wedding-cake to present to the whales.\n\nBoth ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminating in an eye-splice or\nloop coming up from the bottom against the side of the tub, and hanging over its\nedge completely disengaged from everything. This arrangement of the lower end is\nnecessary on two accounts. First: In order to facilitate the fastening to it of\nan additional line from a neighboring boat, in case the stricken whale should\nsound so deep as to threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to\nthe harpoon. In these instances, the whale of course is shifted like a mug of\nale, as it were, from the one boat to the other; though the first boat always\nhovers at hand to assist its consort. Second: This arrangement is indispensable\nfor common safety’s sake; for were the lower end of the line in any way attached\nto the boat, and were the whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a\nsingle, smoking minute as he sometimes does, he would not stop there, for the\ndoomed boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of\nthe sea; and in that case no town-crier would ever find her again.\n\nBefore lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line is taken aft\nfrom the tub, and passing round the loggerhead there, is again carried forward\nthe entire length of the boat, resting crosswise upon the loom or handle of\nevery man’s oar, so that it jogs against his wrist in rowing; and also passing\nbetween the men, as they alternately sit at the opposite gunwales, to the leaded\nchocks or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of the boat, where a wooden pin or\nskewer the size of a common quill, prevents it from slipping out. From the\nchocks it hangs in a slight festoon over the bows, and is then passed inside the\nboat again; and some ten or twenty fathoms (called box-line) being coiled upon\nthe box in the bows, it continues its way to the gunwale still a little further\naft, and is then attached to the short-warp—the rope which is immediately\nconnected with the harpoon; but previous to that connexion, the short-warp goes\nthrough sundry mystifications too tedious to detail.\n\nThus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils, twisting and\nwrithing around it in almost every direction. All the oarsmen are involved in\nits perilous contortions; so that to the timid eye of the landsman, they seem as\nIndian jugglers, with the deadliest snakes sportively festooning their limbs.\nNor can any son of mortal woman, for the first time, seat himself amid those\nhempen intricacies, and while straining his utmost at the oar, bethink him that\nat any unknown instant the harpoon may be darted, and all these horrible\ncontortions be put in play like ringed lightnings; he cannot be thus\ncircumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones to\nquiver in him like a shaken jelly. Yet habit—strange thing! what cannot habit\naccomplish?—Gayer sallies, more merry mirth, better jokes, and brighter\nrepartees, you never heard over your mahogany, than you will hear over the\nhalf-inch white cedar of the whale-boat, when thus hung in hangman’s nooses;\nand, like the six burghers of Calais before King Edward, the six men composing\nthe crew pull into the jaws of death, with a halter around every neck, as you\nmay say.\n\nPerhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for those repeated\nwhaling disasters—some few of which are casually chronicled—of this man or that\nman being taken out of the boat by the line, and lost. For, when the line is\ndarting out, to be seated then in the boat, is like being seated in the midst of\nthe manifold whizzings of a steam-engine in full play, when every flying beam,\nand shaft, and wheel, is grazing you. It is worse; for you cannot sit motionless\nin the heart of these perils, because the boat is rocking like a cradle, and you\nare pitched one way and the other, without the slightest warning; and only by a\ncertain self-adjusting buoyancy and simultaneousness of volition and action, can\nyou escape being made a Mazeppa of, and run away with where the all-seeing sun\nhimself could never pierce you out.\n\nAgain: as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and prophesies of the\nstorm, is perhaps more awful than the storm itself; for, indeed, the calm is but\nthe wrapper and envelope of the storm; and contains it in itself, as the\nseemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal powder, and the ball, and the\nexplosion; so the graceful repose of the line, as it silently serpentines about\nthe oarsmen before being brought into actual play—this is a thing which carries\nmore of true terror than any other aspect of this dangerous affair. But why say\nmore? All men live enveloped in whale-lines. All are born with halters round\ntheir necks; but it is only when caught in the swift, sudden turn of death, that\nmortals realize the silent, subtle, ever-present perils of life. And if you be a\nphilosopher, though seated in the whale-boat, you would not at heart feel one\nwhit more of terror, than though seated before your evening fire with a poker,\nand not a harpoon, by your side.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 61. STUBB KILLS A WHALE.\n\nIf to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid was a thing of portents, to Queequeg\nit was quite a different object.\n\n“When you see him ’quid,” said the savage, honing his harpoon in the bow of his\nhoisted boat, “then you quick see him ’parm whale.”\n\nThe next day was exceedingly still and sultry, and with nothing special to\nengage them, the Pequod’s crew could hardly resist the spell of sleep induced by\nsuch a vacant sea. For this part of the Indian Ocean through which we then were\nvoyaging is not what whalemen call a lively ground; that is, it affords fewer\nglimpses of porpoises, dolphins, flying-fish, and other vivacious denizens of\nmore stirring waters, than those off the Rio de la Plata, or the in-shore ground\noff Peru.\n\nIt was my turn to stand at the foremast-head; and with my shoulders leaning\nagainst the slackened royal shrouds, to and fro I idly swayed in what seemed an\nenchanted air. No resolution could withstand it; in that dreamy mood losing all\nconsciousness, at last my soul went out of my body; though my body still\ncontinued to sway as a pendulum will, long after the power which first moved it\nis withdrawn.\n\nEre forgetfulness altogether came over me, I had noticed that the seamen at the\nmain and mizzen-mast-heads were already drowsy. So that at last all three of us\nlifelessly swung from the spars, and for every swing that we made there was a\nnod from below from the slumbering helmsman. The waves, too, nodded their\nindolent crests; and across the wide trance of the sea, east nodded to west, and\nthe sun over all.\n\nSuddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes; like vices my hands\ngrasped the shrouds; some invisible, gracious agency preserved me; with a shock\nI came back to life. And lo! close under our lee, not forty fathoms off, a\ngigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in the water like the capsized hull of a\nfrigate, his broad, glossy back, of an Ethiopian hue, glistening in the sun’s\nrays like a mirror. But lazily undulating in the trough of the sea, and ever and\nanon tranquilly spouting his vapory jet, the whale looked like a portly burgher\nsmoking his pipe of a warm afternoon. But that pipe, poor whale, was thy last.\nAs if struck by some enchanter’s wand, the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it\nall at once started into wakefulness; and more than a score of voices from all\nparts of the vessel, simultaneously with the three notes from aloft, shouted\nforth the accustomed cry, as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted the\nsparkling brine into the air.\n\n“Clear away the boats! Luff!” cried Ahab. And obeying his own order, he dashed\nthe helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes.\n\nThe sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale; and ere the\nboats were down, majestically turning, he swam away to the leeward, but with\nsuch a steady tranquillity, and making so few ripples as he swam, that thinking\nafter all he might not as yet be alarmed, Ahab gave orders that not an oar\nshould be used, and no man must speak but in whispers. So seated like Ontario\nIndians on the gunwales of the boats, we swiftly but silently paddled along; the\ncalm not admitting of the noiseless sails being set. Presently, as we thus\nglided in chase, the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into\nthe air, and then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up.\n\n“There go flukes!” was the cry, an announcement immediately followed by Stubb’s\nproducing his match and igniting his pipe, for now a respite was granted. After\nthe full interval of his sounding had elapsed, the whale rose again, and being\nnow in advance of the smoker’s boat, and much nearer to it than to any of the\nothers, Stubb counted upon the honor of the capture. It was obvious, now, that\nthe whale had at length become aware of his pursuers. All silence of\ncautiousness was therefore no longer of use. Paddles were dropped, and oars came\nloudly into play. And still puffing at his pipe, Stubb cheered on his crew to\nthe assault.\n\nYes, a mighty change had come over the fish. All alive to his jeopardy, he was\ngoing “head out”; that part obliquely projecting from the mad yeast which he\nbrewed.*\n\n*It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the entire\ninterior of the sperm whale’s enormous head consists. Though apparently the most\nmassive, it is by far the most buoyant part about him. So that with ease he\nelevates it in the air, and invariably does so when going at his utmost speed.\nBesides, such is the breadth of the upper part of the front of his head, and\nsuch the tapering cut-water formation of the lower part, that by obliquely\nelevating his head, he thereby may be said to transform himself from a\nbluff-bowed sluggish galliot into a sharppointed New York pilot-boat.\n\n“Start her, start her, my men! Don’t hurry yourselves; take plenty of time—but\nstart her; start her like thunder-claps, that’s all,” cried Stubb, spluttering\nout the smoke as he spoke. “Start her, now; give ’em the long and strong stroke,\nTashtego. Start her, Tash, my boy—start her, all; but keep cool, keep\ncool—cucumbers is the word—easy, easy—only start her like grim death and\ngrinning devils, and raise the buried dead perpendicular out of their graves,\nboys—that’s all. Start her!”\n\n“Woo-hoo! Wa-hee!” screamed the Gay-Header in reply, raising some old war-whoop\nto the skies; as every oarsman in the strained boat involuntarily bounced\nforward with the one tremendous leading stroke which the eager Indian gave.\n\nBut his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild. “Kee-hee! Kee-hee!”\nyelled Daggoo, straining forwards and backwards on his seat, like a pacing tiger\nin his cage.\n\n“Ka-la! Koo-loo!” howled Queequeg, as if smacking his lips over a mouthful of\nGrenadier’s steak. And thus with oars and yells the keels cut the sea.\nMeanwhile, Stubb retaining his place in the van, still encouraged his men to the\nonset, all the while puffing the smoke from his mouth. Like desperadoes they\ntugged and they strained, till the welcome cry was heard—“Stand up,\nTashtego!—give it to him!” The harpoon was hurled. “Stern all!” The oarsmen\nbacked water; the same moment something went hot and hissing along every one of\ntheir wrists. It was the magical line. An instant before, Stubb had swiftly\ncaught two additional turns with it round the loggerhead, whence, by reason of\nits increased rapid circlings, a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and mingled\nwith the steady fumes from his pipe. As the line passed round and round the\nloggerhead; so also, just before reaching that point, it blisteringly passed\nthrough and through both of Stubb’s hands, from which the hand-cloths, or\nsquares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at these times, had accidentally\ndropped. It was like holding an enemy’s sharp two-edged sword by the blade, and\nthat enemy all the time striving to wrest it out of your clutch.\n\n“Wet the line! wet the line!” cried Stubb to the tub oarsman (him seated by the\ntub) who, snatching off his hat, dashed sea-water into it.* More turns were\ntaken, so that the line began holding its place. The boat now flew through the\nboiling water like a shark all fins. Stubb and Tashtego here changed places—stem\nfor stern—a staggering business truly in that rocking commotion.\n\n*Partly to show the indispensableness of this act, it may here be stated, that,\nin the old Dutch fishery, a mop was used to dash the running line with water; in\nmany other ships, a wooden piggin, or bailer, is set apart for that purpose.\nYour hat, however, is the most convenient.\n\nFrom the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part of the\nboat, and from its now being more tight than a harpstring, you would have\nthought the craft had two keels—one cleaving the water, the other the air—as the\nboat churned on through both opposing elements at once. A continual cascade\nplayed at the bows; a ceaseless whirling eddy in her wake; and, at the slightest\nmotion from within, even but of a little finger, the vibrating, cracking craft\ncanted over her spasmodic gunwale into the sea. Thus they rushed; each man with\nmight and main clinging to his seat, to prevent being tossed to the foam; and\nthe tall form of Tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double, in order\nto bring down his centre of gravity. Whole Atlantics and Pacifics seemed passed\nas they shot on their way, till at length the whale somewhat slackened his\nflight.\n\n“Haul in—haul in!” cried Stubb to the bowsman! and, facing round towards the\nwhale, all hands began pulling the boat up to him, while yet the boat was being\ntowed on. Soon ranging up by his flank, Stubb, firmly planting his knee in the\nclumsy cleat, darted dart after dart into the flying fish; at the word of\ncommand, the boat alternately sterning out of the way of the whale’s horrible\nwallow, and then ranging up for another fling.\n\nThe red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down a hill.\nHis tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood, which bubbled and seethed\nfor furlongs behind in their wake. The slanting sun playing upon this crimson\npond in the sea, sent back its reflection into every face, so that they all\nglowed to each other like red men. And all the while, jet after jet of white\nsmoke was agonizingly shot from the spiracle of the whale, and vehement puff\nafter puff from the mouth of the excited headsman; as at every dart, hauling in\nupon his crooked lance (by the line attached to it), Stubb straightened it again\nand again, by a few rapid blows against the gunwale, then again and again sent\nit into the whale.\n\n“Pull up—pull up!” he now cried to the bowsman, as the waning whale relaxed in\nhis wrath. “Pull up!—close to!” and the boat ranged along the fish’s flank. When\nreaching far over the bow, Stubb slowly churned his long sharp lance into the\nfish, and kept it there, carefully churning and churning, as if cautiously\nseeking to feel after some gold watch that the whale might have swallowed, and\nwhich he was fearful of breaking ere he could hook it out. But that gold watch\nhe sought was the innermost life of the fish. And now it is struck; for,\nstarting from his trance into that unspeakable thing called his “flurry,” the\nmonster horribly wallowed in his blood, overwrapped himself in impenetrable,\nmad, boiling spray, so that the imperilled craft, instantly dropping astern, had\nmuch ado blindly to struggle out from that phrensied twilight into the clear air\nof the day.\n\nAnd now abating in his flurry, the whale once more rolled out into view; surging\nfrom side to side; spasmodically dilating and contracting his spout-hole, with\nsharp, cracking, agonized respirations. At last, gush after gush of clotted red\ngore, as if it had been the purple lees of red wine, shot into the frighted air;\nand falling back again, ran dripping down his motionless flanks into the sea.\nHis heart had burst!\n\n“He’s dead, Mr. Stubb,” said Daggoo.\n\n“Yes; both pipes smoked out!” and withdrawing his own from his mouth, Stubb\nscattered the dead ashes over the water; and, for a moment, stood thoughtfully\neyeing the vast corpse he had made.\n\n"},{"title":"Test Section Title","content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 92. AMBERGRIS.\n\nNow this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as an article\nof commerce, that in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born Captain Coffin was examined\nat the bar of the English House of Commons on that subject. For at that time,\nand indeed until a comparatively late day, the precise origin of ambergris\nremained, like amber itself, a problem to the learned. Though the word ambergris\nis but the French compound for grey amber, yet the two substances are quite\ndistinct. For amber, though at times found on the sea-coast, is also dug up in\nsome far inland soils, whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea.\nBesides, amber is a hard, transparent, brittle, odorless substance, used for\nmouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and ornaments; but ambergris is soft, waxy, and\nso highly fragrant and spicy, that it is largely used in perfumery, in pastiles,\nprecious candles, hair-powders, and pomatum. The Turks use it in cooking, and\nalso carry it to Mecca, for the same purpose that frankincense is carried to St.\nPeter’s in Rome. Some wine merchants drop a few grains into claret, to flavor\nit.\n\nWho would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should regale\nthemselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick whale! Yet\nso it is. By some, ambergris is supposed to be the cause, and by others the\neffect, of the dyspepsia in the whale. How to cure such a dyspepsia it were hard\nto say, unless by administering three or four boat loads of Brandreth’s pills,\nand then running out of harm’s way, as laborers do in blasting rocks.\n\nI have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris, certain hard,\nround, bony plates, which at first Stubb thought might be sailors’ trowsers\nbuttons; but it afterwards turned out that they were nothing more than pieces of\nsmall squid bones embalmed in that manner.\n\nNow that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be found in the\nheart of such decay; is this nothing? Bethink thee of that saying of St. Paul in\nCorinthians, about corruption and incorruption; how that we are sown in\ndishonor, but raised in glory. And likewise call to mind that saying of\nParacelsus about what it is that maketh the best musk. Also forget not the\nstrange fact that of all things of ill-savor, Cologne-water, in its rudimental\nmanufacturing stages, is the worst.\n\nI should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal, but cannot, owing\nto my anxiety to repel a charge often made against whalemen, and which, in the\nestimation of some already biased minds, might be considered as indirectly\nsubstantiated by what has been said of the Frenchman’s two whales. Elsewhere in\nthis volume the slanderous aspersion has been disproved, that the vocation of\nwhaling is throughout a slatternly, untidy business. But there is another thing\nto rebut. They hint that all whales always smell bad. Now how did this odious\nstigma originate?\n\nI opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the Greenland\nwhaling ships in London, more than two centuries ago. Because those whalemen did\nnot then, and do not now, try out their oil at sea as the Southern ships have\nalways done; but cutting up the fresh blubber in small bits, thrust it through\nthe bung holes of large casks, and carry it home in that manner; the shortness\nof the season in those Icy Seas, and the sudden and violent storms to which they\nare exposed, forbidding any other course. The consequence is, that upon breaking\ninto the hold, and unloading one of these whale cemeteries, in the Greenland\ndock, a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising from excavating an\nold city grave-yard, for the foundations of a Lying-in Hospital.\n\nI partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be likewise\nimputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland, in former times, of a Dutch\nvillage called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg, which latter name is the one used\nby the learned Fogo Von Slack, in his great work on Smells, a text-book on that\nsubject. As its name imports (smeer, fat; berg, to put up), this village was\nfounded in order to afford a place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to\nbe tried out, without being taken home to Holland for that purpose. It was a\ncollection of furnaces, fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when the works were in\nfull operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor. But all this is\nquite different with a South Sea Sperm Whaler; which in a voyage of four years\nperhaps, after completely filling her hold with oil, does not, perhaps, consume\nfifty days in the business of boiling out; and in the state that it is casked,\nthe oil is nearly scentless. The truth is, that living or dead, if but decently\ntreated, whales as a species are by no means creatures of ill odor; nor can\nwhalemen be recognised, as the people of the middle ages affected to detect a\nJew in the company, by the nose. Nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise\nthan fragrant, when, as a general thing, he enjoys such high health; taking\nabundance of exercise; always out of doors; though, it is true, seldom in the\nopen air. I say, that the motion of a Sperm Whale’s flukes above water dispenses\na perfume, as when a musk-scented lady rustles her dress in a warm parlor. What\nthen shall I liken the Sperm Whale to for fragrance, considering his magnitude?\nMust it not be to that famous elephant, with jewelled tusks, and redolent with\nmyrrh, which was led out of an Indian town to do honor to Alexander the Great?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 93. THE CASTAWAY.\n\nIt was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman, that a most\nsignificant event befell the most insignificant of the Pequod’s crew; an event\nmost lamentable; and which ended in providing the sometimes madly merry and\npredestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying prophecy of whatever\nshattered sequel might prove her own.\n\nNow, in the whale ship, it is not every one that goes in the boats. Some few\nhands are reserved called ship-keepers, whose province it is to work the vessel\nwhile the boats are pursuing the whale. As a general thing, these ship-keepers\nare as hardy fellows as the men comprising the boats’ crews. But if there happen\nto be an unduly slender, clumsy, or timorous wight in the ship, that wight is\ncertain to be made a ship-keeper. It was so in the Pequod with the little negro\nPippin by nick-name, Pip by abbreviation. Poor Pip! ye have heard of him before;\nye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight, so gloomy-jolly.\n\nIn outer aspect, Pip and Dough-Boy made a match, like a black pony and a white\none, of equal developments, though of dissimilar colour, driven in one eccentric\nspan. But while hapless Dough-Boy was by nature dull and torpid in his\nintellects, Pip, though over tender-hearted, was at bottom very bright, with\nthat pleasant, genial, jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe; a tribe, which\never enjoy all holidays and festivities with finer, freer relish than any other\nrace. For blacks, the year’s calendar should show naught but three hundred and\nsixty-five Fourth of Julys and New Year’s Days. Nor smile so, while I write that\nthis little black was brilliant, for even blackness has its brilliancy; behold\nyon lustrous ebony, panelled in king’s cabinets. But Pip loved life, and all\nlife’s peaceable securities; so that the panic-striking business in which he had\nsomehow unaccountably become entrapped, had most sadly blurred his brightness;\nthough, as ere long will be seen, what was thus temporarily subdued in him, in\nthe end was destined to be luridly illumined by strange wild fires, that\nfictitiously showed him off to ten times the natural lustre with which in his\nnative Tolland County in Connecticut, he had once enlivened many a fiddler’s\nfrolic on the green; and at melodious even-tide, with his gay ha-ha! had turned\nthe round horizon into one star-belled tambourine. So, though in the clear air\nof day, suspended against a blue-veined neck, the pure-watered diamond drop will\nhealthful glow; yet, when the cunning jeweller would show you the diamond in its\nmost impressive lustre, he lays it against a gloomy ground, and then lights it\nup, not by the sun, but by some unnatural gases. Then come out those fiery\neffulgences, infernally superb; then the evil-blazing diamond, once the divinest\nsymbol of the crystal skies, looks like some crown-jewel stolen from the King of\nHell. But let us to the story.\n\nIt came to pass, that in the ambergris affair Stubb’s after-oarsman chanced so\nto sprain his hand, as for a time to become quite maimed; and, temporarily, Pip\nwas put into his place.\n\nThe first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much nervousness; but\nhappily, for that time, escaped close contact with the whale; and therefore came\noff not altogether discreditably; though Stubb observing him, took care,\nafterwards, to exhort him to cherish his courageousness to the utmost, for he\nmight often find it needful.\n\nNow upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as the fish\nreceived the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which happened, in this\ninstance, to be right under poor Pip’s seat. The involuntary consternation of\nthe moment caused him to leap, paddle in hand, out of the boat; and in such a\nway, that part of the slack whale line coming against his chest, he breasted it\noverboard with him, so as to become entangled in it, when at last plumping into\nthe water. That instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the line\nswiftly straightened; and presto! poor Pip came all foaming up to the chocks of\nthe boat, remorselessly dragged there by the line, which had taken several turns\naround his chest and neck.\n\nTashtego stood in the bows. He was full of the fire of the hunt. He hated Pip\nfor a poltroon. Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath, he suspended its sharp\nedge over the line, and turning towards Stubb, exclaimed interrogatively, “Cut?”\nMeantime Pip’s blue, choked face plainly looked, Do, for God’s sake! All passed\nin a flash. In less than half a minute, this entire thing happened.\n\n“Damn him, cut!” roared Stubb; and so the whale was lost and Pip was saved.\n\nSo soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed by yells and\nexecrations from the crew. Tranquilly permitting these irregular cursings to\nevaporate, Stubb then in a plain, business-like, but still half humorous manner,\ncursed Pip officially; and that done, unofficially gave him much wholesome\nadvice. The substance was, Never jump from a boat, Pip, except—but all the rest\nwas indefinite, as the soundest advice ever is. Now, in general, Stick to the\nboat, is your true motto in whaling; but cases will sometimes happen when Leap\nfrom the boat, is still better. Moreover, as if perceiving at last that if he\nshould give undiluted conscientious advice to Pip, he would be leaving him too\nwide a margin to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly dropped all advice, and\nconcluded with a peremptory command, “Stick to the boat, Pip, or by the Lord, I\nwon’t pick you up if you jump; mind that. We can’t afford to lose whales by the\nlikes of you; a whale would sell for thirty times what you would, Pip, in\nAlabama. Bear that in mind, and don’t jump any more.” Hereby perhaps Stubb\nindirectly hinted, that though man loved his fellow, yet man is a money-making\nanimal, which propensity too often interferes with his benevolence.\n\nBut we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again. It was under very\nsimilar circumstances to the first performance; but this time he did not breast\nout the line; and hence, when the whale started to run, Pip was left behind on\nthe sea, like a hurried traveller’s trunk. Alas! Stubb was but too true to his\nword. It was a beautiful, bounteous, blue day; the spangled sea calm and cool,\nand flatly stretching away, all round, to the horizon, like gold-beater’s skin\nhammered out to the extremest. Bobbing up and down in that sea, Pip’s ebon head\nshowed like a head of cloves. No boat-knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly\nastern. Stubb’s inexorable back was turned upon him; and the whale was winged.\nIn three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between Pip and Stubb. Out\nfrom the centre of the sea, poor Pip turned his crisp, curling, black head to\nthe sun, another lonely castaway, though the loftiest and the brightest.\n\nNow, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the practised\nswimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore. But the awful lonesomeness is\nintolerable. The intense concentration of self in the middle of such a heartless\nimmensity, my God! who can tell it? Mark, how when sailors in a dead calm bathe\nin the open sea—mark how closely they hug their ship and only coast along her\nsides.\n\nBut had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate? No; he did not\nmean to, at least. Because there were two boats in his wake, and he supposed, no\ndoubt, that they would of course come up to Pip very quickly, and pick him up;\nthough, indeed, such considerations towards oarsmen jeopardized through their\nown timidity, is not always manifested by the hunters in all similar instances;\nand such instances not unfrequently occur; almost invariably in the fishery, a\ncoward, so called, is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to\nmilitary navies and armies.\n\nBut it so happened, that those boats, without seeing Pip, suddenly spying whales\nclose to them on one side, turned, and gave chase; and Stubb’s boat was now so\nfar away, and he and all his crew so intent upon his fish, that Pip’s ringed\nhorizon began to expand around him miserably. By the merest chance the ship\nitself at last rescued him; but from that hour the little negro went about the\ndeck an idiot; such, at least, they said he was. The sea had jeeringly kept his\nfinite body up, but drowned the infinite of his soul. Not drowned entirely,\nthough. Rather carried down alive to wondrous depths, where strange shapes of\nthe unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes; and the\nmiser-merman, Wisdom, revealed his hoarded heaps; and among the joyous,\nheartless, ever-juvenile eternities, Pip saw the multitudinous, God-omnipresent,\ncoral insects, that out of the firmament of waters heaved the colossal orbs. He\nsaw God’s foot upon the treadle of the loom, and spoke it; and therefore his\nshipmates called him mad. So man’s insanity is heaven’s sense; and wandering\nfrom all mortal reason, man comes at last to that celestial thought, which, to\nreason, is absurd and frantic; and weal or woe, feels then uncompromised,\nindifferent as his God.\n\nFor the rest, blame not Stubb too hardly. The thing is common in that fishery;\nand in the sequel of the narrative, it will then be seen what like abandonment\nbefell myself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 94. A SQUEEZE OF THE HAND.\n\nThat whale of Stubb’s, so dearly purchased, was duly brought to the Pequod’s\nside, where all those cutting and hoisting operations previously detailed, were\nregularly gone through, even to the baling of the Heidelburgh Tun, or Case.\n\nWhile some were occupied with this latter duty, others were employed in dragging\naway the larger tubs, so soon as filled with the sperm; and when the proper time\narrived, this same sperm was carefully manipulated ere going to the try-works,\nof which anon.\n\nIt had cooled and crystallized to such a degree, that when, with several others,\nI sat down before a large Constantine’s bath of it, I found it strangely\nconcreted into lumps, here and there rolling about in the liquid part. It was\nour business to squeeze these lumps back into fluid. A sweet and unctuous duty!\nNo wonder that in old times this sperm was such a favourite cosmetic. Such a\nclearer! such a sweetener! such a softener! such a delicious molifier! After\nhaving my hands in it for only a few minutes, my fingers felt like eels, and\nbegan, as it were, to serpentine and spiralise.\n\nAs I sat there at my ease, cross-legged on the deck; after the bitter exertion\nat the windlass; under a blue tranquil sky; the ship under indolent sail, and\ngliding so serenely along; as I bathed my hands among those soft, gentle\nglobules of infiltrated tissues, woven almost within the hour; as they richly\nbroke to my fingers, and discharged all their opulence, like fully ripe grapes\ntheir wine; as I snuffed up that uncontaminated aroma,—literally and truly, like\nthe smell of spring violets; I declare to you, that for the time I lived as in a\nmusky meadow; I forgot all about our horrible oath; in that inexpressible sperm,\nI washed my hands and my heart of it; I almost began to credit the old\nParacelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in allaying the heat of\nanger; while bathing in that bath, I felt divinely free from all ill-will, or\npetulance, or malice, of any sort whatsoever.\n\nSqueeze! squeeze! squeeze! all the morning long; I squeezed that sperm till I\nmyself almost melted into it; I squeezed that sperm till a strange sort of\ninsanity came over me; and I found myself unwittingly squeezing my co-laborers’\nhands in it, mistaking their hands for the gentle globules. Such an abounding,\naffectionate, friendly, loving feeling did this avocation beget; that at last I\nwas continually squeezing their hands, and looking up into their eyes\nsentimentally; as much as to say,—Oh! my dear fellow beings, why should we\nlonger cherish any social acerbities, or know the slightest ill-humor or envy!\nCome; let us squeeze hands all round; nay, let us all squeeze ourselves into\neach other; let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and sperm of\nkindness.\n\nWould that I could keep squeezing that sperm for ever! For now, since by many\nprolonged, repeated experiences, I have perceived that in all cases man must\neventually lower, or at least shift, his conceit of attainable felicity; not\nplacing it anywhere in the intellect or the fancy; but in the wife, the heart,\nthe bed, the table, the saddle, the fireside, the country; now that I have\nperceived all this, I am ready to squeeze case eternally. In thoughts of the\nvisions of the night, I saw long rows of angels in paradise, each with his hands\nin a jar of spermaceti.\n\nNow, while discoursing of sperm, it behooves to speak of other things akin to\nit, in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the try-works.\n\nFirst comes white-horse, so called, which is obtained from the tapering part of\nthe fish, and also from the thicker portions of his flukes. It is tough with\ncongealed tendons—a wad of muscle—but still contains some oil. After being\nsevered from the whale, the white-horse is first cut into portable oblongs ere\ngoing to the mincer. They look much like blocks of Berkshire marble.\n\nPlum-pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the whale’s\nflesh, here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber, and often\nparticipating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness. It is a most\nrefreshing, convivial, beautiful object to behold. As its name imports, it is of\nan exceedingly rich, mottled tint, with a bestreaked snowy and golden ground,\ndotted with spots of the deepest crimson and purple. It is plums of rubies, in\npictures of citron. Spite of reason, it is hard to keep yourself from eating it.\nI confess, that once I stole behind the foremast to try it. It tasted something\nas I should conceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of Louis le Gros might have\ntasted, supposing him to have been killed the first day after the venison\nseason, and that particular venison season contemporary with an unusually fine\nvintage of the vineyards of Champagne.\n\nThere is another substance, and a very singular one, which turns up in the\ncourse of this business, but which I feel it to be very puzzling adequately to\ndescribe. It is called slobgollion; an appellation original with the whalemen,\nand even so is the nature of the substance. It is an ineffably oozy, stringy\naffair, most frequently found in the tubs of sperm, after a prolonged squeezing,\nand subsequent decanting. I hold it to be the wondrously thin, ruptured\nmembranes of the case, coalescing.\n\nGurry, so called, is a term properly belonging to right whalemen, but sometimes\nincidentally used by the sperm fishermen. It designates the dark, glutinous\nsubstance which is scraped off the back of the Greenland or right whale, and\nmuch of which covers the decks of those inferior souls who hunt that ignoble\nLeviathan.\n\nNippers. Strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale’s vocabulary. But as\napplied by whalemen, it becomes so. A whaleman’s nipper is a short firm strip of\ntendinous stuff cut from the tapering part of Leviathan’s tail: it averages an\ninch in thickness, and for the rest, is about the size of the iron part of a\nhoe. Edgewise moved along the oily deck, it operates like a leathern squilgee;\nand by nameless blandishments, as of magic, allures along with it all\nimpurities.\n\nBut to learn all about these recondite matters, your best way is at once to\ndescend into the blubber-room, and have a long talk with its inmates. This place\nhas previously been mentioned as the receptacle for the blanket-pieces, when\nstript and hoisted from the whale. When the proper time arrives for cutting up\nits contents, this apartment is a scene of terror to all tyros, especially by\nnight. On one side, lit by a dull lantern, a space has been left clear for the\nworkmen. They generally go in pairs,—a pike-and-gaffman and a spade-man. The\nwhaling-pike is similar to a frigate’s boarding-weapon of the same name. The\ngaff is something like a boat-hook. With his gaff, the gaffman hooks on to a\nsheet of blubber, and strives to hold it from slipping, as the ship pitches and\nlurches about. Meanwhile, the spade-man stands on the sheet itself,\nperpendicularly chopping it into the portable horse-pieces. This spade is sharp\nas hone can make it; the spademan’s feet are shoeless; the thing he stands on\nwill sometimes irresistibly slide away from him, like a sledge. If he cuts off\none of his own toes, or one of his assistants’, would you be very much\nastonished? Toes are scarce among veteran blubber-room men.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 95. THE CASSOCK.\n\nHad you stepped on board the Pequod at a certain juncture of this\npost-mortemizing of the whale; and had you strolled forward nigh the windlass,\npretty sure am I that you would have scanned with no small curiosity a very\nstrange, enigmatical object, which you would have seen there, lying along\nlengthwise in the lee scuppers. Not the wondrous cistern in the whale’s huge\nhead; not the prodigy of his unhinged lower jaw; not the miracle of his\nsymmetrical tail; none of these would so surprise you, as half a glimpse of that\nunaccountable cone,—longer than a Kentuckian is tall, nigh a foot in diameter at\nthe base, and jet-black as Yojo, the ebony idol of Queequeg. And an idol,\nindeed, it is; or, rather, in old times, its likeness was. Such an idol as that\nfound in the secret groves of Queen Maachah in Judea; and for worshipping which,\nKing Asa, her son, did depose her, and destroyed the idol, and burnt it for an\nabomination at the brook Kedron, as darkly set forth in the 15th chapter of the\nFirst Book of Kings.\n\nLook at the sailor, called the mincer, who now comes along, and assisted by two\nallies, heavily backs the grandissimus, as the mariners call it, and with bowed\nshoulders, staggers off with it as if he were a grenadier carrying a dead\ncomrade from the field. Extending it upon the forecastle deck, he now proceeds\ncylindrically to remove its dark pelt, as an African hunter the pelt of a boa.\nThis done he turns the pelt inside out, like a pantaloon leg; gives it a good\nstretching, so as almost to double its diameter; and at last hangs it, well\nspread, in the rigging, to dry. Ere long, it is taken down; when removing some\nthree feet of it, towards the pointed extremity, and then cutting two slits for\narm-holes at the other end, he lengthwise slips himself bodily into it. The\nmincer now stands before you invested in the full canonicals of his calling.\nImmemorial to all his order, this investiture alone will adequately protect him,\nwhile employed in the peculiar functions of his office.\n\nThat office consists in mincing the horse-pieces of blubber for the pots; an\noperation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse, planted endwise against\nthe bulwarks, and with a capacious tub beneath it, into which the minced pieces\ndrop, fast as the sheets from a rapt orator’s desk. Arrayed in decent black;\noccupying a conspicuous pulpit; intent on bible leaves; what a candidate for an\narchbishopric, what a lad for a Pope were this mincer!*\n\n*Bible leaves! Bible leaves! This is the invariable cry from the mates to the\nmincer. It enjoins him to be careful, and cut his work into as thin slices as\npossible, inasmuch as by so doing the business of boiling out the oil is much\naccelerated, and its quantity considerably increased, besides perhaps improving\nit in quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 96. THE TRY-WORKS.\n\nBesides her hoisted boats, an American whaler is outwardly distinguished by her\ntry-works. She presents the curious anomaly of the most solid masonry joining\nwith oak and hemp in constituting the completed ship. It is as if from the open\nfield a brick-kiln were transported to her planks.\n\nThe try-works are planted between the foremast and mainmast, the most roomy part\nof the deck. The timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength, fitted to sustain\nthe weight of an almost solid mass of brick and mortar, some ten feet by eight\nsquare, and five in height. The foundation does not penetrate the deck, but the\nmasonry is firmly secured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it\non all sides, and screwing it down to the timbers. On the flanks it is cased\nwith wood, and at top completely covered by a large, sloping, battened hatchway.\nRemoving this hatch we expose the great try-pots, two in number, and each of\nseveral barrels’ capacity. When not in use, they are kept remarkably clean.\nSometimes they are polished with soapstone and sand, till they shine within like\nsilver punch-bowls. During the night-watches some cynical old sailors will crawl\ninto them and coil themselves away there for a nap. While employed in polishing\nthem—one man in each pot, side by side—many confidential communications are\ncarried on, over the iron lips. It is a place also for profound mathematical\nmeditation. It was in the left hand try-pot of the Pequod, with the soapstone\ndiligently circling round me, that I was first indirectly struck by the\nremarkable fact, that in geometry all bodies gliding along the cycloid, my\nsoapstone for example, will descend from any point in precisely the same time.\n\nRemoving the fire-board from the front of the try-works, the bare masonry of\nthat side is exposed, penetrated by the two iron mouths of the furnaces,\ndirectly underneath the pots. These mouths are fitted with heavy doors of iron.\nThe intense heat of the fire is prevented from communicating itself to the deck,\nby means of a shallow reservoir extending under the entire inclosed surface of\nthe works. By a tunnel inserted at the rear, this reservoir is kept replenished\nwith water as fast as it evaporates. There are no external chimneys; they open\ndirect from the rear wall. And here let us go back for a moment.\n\nIt was about nine o’clock at night that the Pequod’s try-works were first\nstarted on this present voyage. It belonged to Stubb to oversee the business.\n\n“All ready there? Off hatch, then, and start her. You cook, fire the works.”\nThis was an easy thing, for the carpenter had been thrusting his shavings into\nthe furnace throughout the passage. Here be it said that in a whaling voyage the\nfirst fire in the try-works has to be fed for a time with wood. After that no\nwood is used, except as a means of quick ignition to the staple fuel. In a word,\nafter being tried out, the crisp, shrivelled blubber, now called scraps or\nfritters, still contains considerable of its unctuous properties. These fritters\nfeed the flames. Like a plethoric burning martyr, or a self-consuming\nmisanthrope, once ignited, the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by his own\nbody. Would that he consumed his own smoke! for his smoke is horrible to inhale,\nand inhale it you must, and not only that, but you must live in it for the time.\nIt has an unspeakable, wild, Hindoo odor about it, such as may lurk in the\nvicinity of funereal pyres. It smells like the left wing of the day of judgment;\nit is an argument for the pit.\n\nBy midnight the works were in full operation. We were clear from the carcase;\nsail had been made; the wind was freshening; the wild ocean darkness was\nintense. But that darkness was licked up by the fierce flames, which at\nintervals forked forth from the sooty flues, and illuminated every lofty rope in\nthe rigging, as with the famed Greek fire. The burning ship drove on, as if\nremorselessly commissioned to some vengeful deed. So the pitch and\nsulphur-freighted brigs of the bold Hydriote, Canaris, issuing from their\nmidnight harbors, with broad sheets of flame for sails, bore down upon the\nTurkish frigates, and folded them in conflagrations.\n\nThe hatch, removed from the top of the works, now afforded a wide hearth in\nfront of them. Standing on this were the Tartarean shapes of the pagan\nharpooneers, always the whale-ship’s stokers. With huge pronged poles they\npitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding pots, or stirred up the\nfires beneath, till the snaky flames darted, curling, out of the doors to catch\nthem by the feet. The smoke rolled away in sullen heaps. To every pitch of the\nship there was a pitch of the boiling oil, which seemed all eagerness to leap\ninto their faces. Opposite the mouth of the works, on the further side of the\nwide wooden hearth, was the windlass. This served for a sea-sofa. Here lounged\nthe watch, when not otherwise employed, looking into the red heat of the fire,\ntill their eyes felt scorched in their heads. Their tawny features, now all\nbegrimed with smoke and sweat, their matted beards, and the contrasting barbaric\nbrilliancy of their teeth, all these were strangely revealed in the capricious\nemblazonings of the works. As they narrated to each other their unholy\nadventures, their tales of terror told in words of mirth; as their uncivilized\nlaughter forked upwards out of them, like the flames from the furnace; as to and\nfro, in their front, the harpooneers wildly gesticulated with their huge pronged\nforks and dippers; as the wind howled on, and the sea leaped, and the ship\ngroaned and dived, and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further and further\ninto the blackness of the sea and the night, and scornfully champed the white\nbone in her mouth, and viciously spat round her on all sides; then the rushing\nPequod, freighted with savages, and laden with fire, and burning a corpse, and\nplunging into that blackness of darkness, seemed the material counterpart of her\nmonomaniac commander’s soul.\n\nSo seemed it to me, as I stood at her helm, and for long hours silently guided\nthe way of this fire-ship on the sea. Wrapped, for that interval, in darkness\nmyself, I but the better saw the redness, the madness, the ghastliness of\nothers. The continual sight of the fiend shapes before me, capering half in\nsmoke and half in fire, these at last begat kindred visions in my soul, so soon\nas I began to yield to that unaccountable drowsiness which ever would come over\nme at a midnight helm.\n\nBut that night, in particular, a strange (and ever since inexplicable) thing\noccurred to me. Starting from a brief standing sleep, I was horribly conscious\nof something fatally wrong. The jaw-bone tiller smote my side, which leaned\nagainst it; in my ears was the low hum of sails, just beginning to shake in the\nwind; I thought my eyes were open; I was half conscious of putting my fingers to\nthe lids and mechanically stretching them still further apart. But, spite of all\nthis, I could see no compass before me to steer by; though it seemed but a\nminute since I had been watching the card, by the steady binnacle lamp\nilluminating it. Nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom, now and then made\nghastly by flashes of redness. Uppermost was the impression, that whatever\nswift, rushing thing I stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as\nrushing from all havens astern. A stark, bewildered feeling, as of death, came\nover me. Convulsively my hands grasped the tiller, but with the crazy conceit\nthat the tiller was, somehow, in some enchanted way, inverted. My God! what is\nthe matter with me? thought I. Lo! in my brief sleep I had turned myself about,\nand was fronting the ship’s stern, with my back to her prow and the compass. In\nan instant I faced back, just in time to prevent the vessel from flying up into\nthe wind, and very probably capsizing her. How glad and how grateful the relief\nfrom this unnatural hallucination of the night, and the fatal contingency of\nbeing brought by the lee!\n\nLook not too long in the face of the fire, O man! Never dream with thy hand on\nthe helm! Turn not thy back to the compass; accept the first hint of the\nhitching tiller; believe not the artificial fire, when its redness makes all\nthings look ghastly. To-morrow, in the natural sun, the skies will be bright;\nthose who glared like devils in the forking flames, the morn will show in far\nother, at least gentler, relief; the glorious, golden, glad sun, the only true\nlamp—all others but liars!\n\nNevertheless the sun hides not Virginia’s Dismal Swamp, nor Rome’s accursed\nCampagna, nor wide Sahara, nor all the millions of miles of deserts and of\ngriefs beneath the moon. The sun hides not the ocean, which is the dark side of\nthis earth, and which is two thirds of this earth. So, therefore, that mortal\nman who hath more of joy than sorrow in him, that mortal man cannot be true—not\ntrue, or undeveloped. With books the same. The truest of all men was the Man of\nSorrows, and the truest of all books is Solomon’s, and Ecclesiastes is the fine\nhammered steel of woe. “All is vanity.” ALL. This wilful world hath not got hold\nof unchristian Solomon’s wisdom yet. But he who dodges hospitals and jails, and\nwalks fast crossing graveyards, and would rather talk of operas than hell; calls\nCowper, Young, Pascal, Rousseau, poor devils all of sick men; and throughout a\ncare-free lifetime swears by Rabelais as passing wise, and therefore jolly;—not\nthat man is fitted to sit down on tomb-stones, and break the green damp mould\nwith unfathomably wondrous Solomon.\n\nBut even Solomon, he says, “the man that wandereth out of the way of\nunderstanding shall remain” (i.e., even while living) “in the congregation of\nthe dead.” Give not thyself up, then, to fire, lest it invert thee, deaden thee;\nas for the time it did me. There is a wisdom that is woe; but there is a woe\nthat is madness. And there is a Catskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive\ndown into the blackest gorges, and soar out of them again and become invisible\nin the sunny spaces. And even if he for ever flies within the gorge, that gorge\nis in the mountains; so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle is\nstill higher than other birds upon the plain, even though they soar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 97. THE LAMP.\n\nHad you descended from the Pequod’s try-works to the Pequod’s forecastle, where\nthe off duty watch were sleeping, for one single moment you would have almost\nthought you were standing in some illuminated shrine of canonized kings and\ncounsellors. There they lay in their triangular oaken vaults, each mariner a\nchiselled muteness; a score of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyes.\n\nIn merchantmen, oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of queens. To\ndress in the dark, and eat in the dark, and stumble in darkness to his pallet,\nthis is his usual lot. But the whaleman, as he seeks the food of light, so he\nlives in light. He makes his berth an Aladdin’s lamp, and lays him down in it;\nso that in the pitchiest night the ship’s black hull still houses an\nillumination.\n\nSee with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful of lamps—often but\nold bottles and vials, though—to the copper cooler at the try-works, and\nreplenishes them there, as mugs of ale at a vat. He burns, too, the purest of\noil, in its unmanufactured, and, therefore, unvitiated state; a fluid unknown to\nsolar, lunar, or astral contrivances ashore. It is sweet as early grass butter\nin April. He goes and hunts for his oil, so as to be sure of its freshness and\ngenuineness, even as the traveller on the prairie hunts up his own supper of\ngame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 98. STOWING DOWN AND CLEARING UP.\n\nAlready has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off descried from\nthe mast-head; how he is chased over the watery moors, and slaughtered in the\nvalleys of the deep; how he is then towed alongside and beheaded; and how (on\nthe principle which entitled the headsman of old to the garments in which the\nbeheaded was killed) his great padded surtout becomes the property of his\nexecutioner; how, in due time, he is condemned to the pots, and, like Shadrach,\nMeshach, and Abednego, his spermaceti, oil, and bone pass unscathed through the\nfire;—but now it remains to conclude the last chapter of this part of the\ndescription by rehearsing—singing, if I may—the romantic proceeding of decanting\noff his oil into the casks and striking them down into the hold, where once\nagain leviathan returns to his native profundities, sliding along beneath the\nsurface as before; but, alas! never more to rise and blow.\n\nWhile still warm, the oil, like hot punch, is received into the six-barrel\ncasks; and while, perhaps, the ship is pitching and rolling this way and that in\nthe midnight sea, the enormous casks are slewed round and headed over, end for\nend, and sometimes perilously scoot across the slippery deck, like so many land\nslides, till at last man-handled and stayed in their course; and all round the\nhoops, rap, rap, go as many hammers as can play upon them, for now, ex officio,\nevery sailor is a cooper.\n\nAt length, when the last pint is casked, and all is cool, then the great\nhatchways are unsealed, the bowels of the ship are thrown open, and down go the\ncasks to their final rest in the sea. This done, the hatches are replaced, and\nhermetically closed, like a closet walled up.\n\nIn the sperm fishery, this is perhaps one of the most remarkable incidents in\nall the business of whaling. One day the planks stream with freshets of blood\nand oil; on the sacred quarter-deck enormous masses of the whale’s head are\nprofanely piled; great rusty casks lie about, as in a brewery yard; the smoke\nfrom the try-works has besooted all the bulwarks; the mariners go about suffused\nwith unctuousness; the entire ship seems great leviathan himself; while on all\nhands the din is deafening.\n\nBut a day or two after, you look about you, and prick your ears in this\nself-same ship; and were it not for the tell-tale boats and try-works, you would\nall but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel, with a most scrupulously\nneat commander. The unmanufactured sperm oil possesses a singularly cleansing\nvirtue. This is the reason why the decks never look so white as just after what\nthey call an affair of oil. Besides, from the ashes of the burned scraps of the\nwhale, a potent lye is readily made; and whenever any adhesiveness from the back\nof the whale remains clinging to the side, that lye quickly exterminates it.\nHands go diligently along the bulwarks, and with buckets of water and rags\nrestore them to their full tidiness. The soot is brushed from the lower rigging.\nAll the numerous implements which have been in use are likewise faithfully\ncleansed and put away. The great hatch is scrubbed and placed upon the\ntry-works, completely hiding the pots; every cask is out of sight; all tackles\nare coiled in unseen nooks; and when by the combined and simultaneous industry\nof almost the entire ship’s company, the whole of this conscientious duty is at\nlast concluded, then the crew themselves proceed to their own ablutions; shift\nthemselves from top to toe; and finally issue to the immaculate deck, fresh and\nall aglow, as bridegrooms new-leaped from out the daintiest Holland.\n\nNow, with elated step, they pace the planks in twos and threes, and humorously\ndiscourse of parlors, sofas, carpets, and fine cambrics; propose to mat the\ndeck; think of having hanging to the top; object not to taking tea by moonlight\non the piazza of the forecastle. To hint to such musked mariners of oil, and\nbone, and blubber, were little short of audacity. They know not the thing you\ndistantly allude to. Away, and bring us napkins!\n\nBut mark: aloft there, at the three mast heads, stand three men intent on spying\nout more whales, which, if caught, infallibly will again soil the old oaken\nfurniture, and drop at least one small grease-spot somewhere. Yes; and many is\nthe time, when, after the severest uninterrupted labors, which know no night;\ncontinuing straight through for ninety-six hours; when from the boat, where they\nhave swelled their wrists with all day rowing on the Line,—they only step to the\ndeck to carry vast chains, and heave the heavy windlass, and cut and slash, yea,\nand in their very sweatings to be smoked and burned anew by the combined fires\nof the equatorial sun and the equatorial try-works; when, on the heel of all\nthis, they have finally bestirred themselves to cleanse the ship, and make a\nspotless dairy room of it; many is the time the poor fellows, just buttoning the\nnecks of their clean frocks, are startled by the cry of “There she blows!” and\naway they fly to fight another whale, and go through the whole weary thing\nagain. Oh! my friends, but this is man-killing! Yet this is life. For hardly\nhave we mortals by long toilings extracted from this world’s vast bulk its small\nbut valuable sperm; and then, with weary patience, cleansed ourselves from its\ndefilements, and learned to live here in clean tabernacles of the soul; hardly\nis this done, when—There she blows!—the ghost is spouted up, and away we sail to\nfight some other world, and go through young life’s old routine again.\n\nOh! the metempsychosis! Oh! Pythagoras, that in bright Greece, two thousand\nyears ago, did die, so good, so wise, so mild; I sailed with thee along the\nPeruvian coast last voyage—and, foolish as I am, taught thee, a green simple\nboy, how to splice a rope!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 99. THE DOUBLOON.\n\nEre now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace his quarter-deck, taking\nregular turns at either limit, the binnacle and mainmast; but in the\nmultiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not been added how that\nsometimes in these walks, when most plunged in his mood, he was wont to pause in\nturn at each spot, and stand there strangely eyeing the particular object before\nhim. When he halted before the binnacle, with his glance fastened on the pointed\nneedle in the compass, that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed\nintensity of his purpose; and when resuming his walk he again paused before the\nmainmast, then, as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted gold coin\nthere, he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness, only dashed with a\ncertain wild longing, if not hopefulness.\n\nBut one morning, turning to pass the doubloon, he seemed to be newly attracted\nby the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it, as though now for the\nfirst time beginning to interpret for himself in some monomaniac way whatever\nsignificance might lurk in them. And some certain significance lurks in all\nthings, else all things are little worth, and the round world itself but an\nempty cipher, except to sell by the cartload, as they do hills about Boston, to\nfill up some morass in the Milky Way.\n\nNow this doubloon was of purest, virgin gold, raked somewhere out of the heart\nof gorgeous hills, whence, east and west, over golden sands, the head-waters of\nmany a Pactolus flows. And though now nailed amidst all the rustiness of iron\nbolts and the verdigris of copper spikes, yet, untouchable and immaculate to any\nfoulness, it still preserved its Quito glow. Nor, though placed amongst a\nruthless crew and every hour passed by ruthless hands, and through the livelong\nnights shrouded with thick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach,\nnevertheless every sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last. For\nit was set apart and sanctified to one awe-striking end; and however wanton in\ntheir sailor ways, one and all, the mariners revered it as the white whale’s\ntalisman. Sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night, wondering\nwhose it was to be at last, and whether he would ever live to spend it.\n\nNow those noble golden coins of South America are as medals of the sun and\ntropic token-pieces. Here palms, alpacas, and volcanoes; sun’s disks and stars;\necliptics, horns-of-plenty, and rich banners waving, are in luxuriant profusion\nstamped; so that the precious gold seems almost to derive an added preciousness\nand enhancing glories, by passing through those fancy mints, so Spanishly\npoetic.\n\nIt so chanced that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most wealthy example of\nthese things. On its round border it bore the letters, REPUBLICA DEL ECUADOR:\nQUITO. So this bright coin came from a country planted in the middle of the\nworld, and beneath the great equator, and named after it; and it had been cast\nmidway up the Andes, in the unwaning clime that knows no autumn. Zoned by those\nletters you saw the likeness of three Andes’ summits; from one a flame; a tower\non another; on the third a crowing cock; while arching over all was a segment of\nthe partitioned zodiac, the signs all marked with their usual cabalistics, and\nthe keystone sun entering the equinoctial point at Libra.\n\nBefore this equatorial coin, Ahab, not unobserved by others, was now pausing.\n\n“There’s something ever egotistical in mountain-tops and towers, and all other\ngrand and lofty things; look here,—three peaks as proud as Lucifer. The firm\ntower, that is Ahab; the volcano, that is Ahab; the courageous, the undaunted,\nand victorious fowl, that, too, is Ahab; all are Ahab; and this round gold is\nbut the image of the rounder globe, which, like a magician’s glass, to each and\nevery man in turn but mirrors back his own mysterious self. Great pains, small\ngains for those who ask the world to solve them; it cannot solve itself.\nMethinks now this coined sun wears a ruddy face; but see! aye, he enters the\nsign of storms, the equinox! and but six months before he wheeled out of a\nformer equinox at Aries! From storm to storm! So be it, then. Born in throes,\n’tis fit that man should live in pains and die in pangs! So be it, then! Here’s\nstout stuff for woe to work on. So be it, then.”\n\n“No fairy fingers can have pressed the gold, but devil’s claws must have left\ntheir mouldings there since yesterday,” murmured Starbuck to himself, leaning\nagainst the bulwarks. “The old man seems to read Belshazzar’s awful writing. I\nhave never marked the coin inspectingly. He goes below; let me read. A dark\nvalley between three mighty, heaven-abiding peaks, that almost seem the Trinity,\nin some faint earthly symbol. So in this vale of Death, God girds us round; and\nover all our gloom, the sun of Righteousness still shines a beacon and a hope.\nIf we bend down our eyes, the dark vale shows her mouldy soil; but if we lift\nthem, the bright sun meets our glance half way, to cheer. Yet, oh, the great sun\nis no fixture; and if, at midnight, we would fain snatch some sweet solace from\nhim, we gaze for him in vain! This coin speaks wisely, mildly, truly, but still\nsadly to me. I will quit it, lest Truth shake me falsely.”\n\n“There now’s the old Mogul,” soliloquized Stubb by the try-works, “he’s been\ntwigging it; and there goes Starbuck from the same, and both with faces which I\nshould say might be somewhere within nine fathoms long. And all from looking at\na piece of gold, which did I have it now on Negro Hill or in Corlaer’s Hook, I’d\nnot look at it very long ere spending it. Humph! in my poor, insignificant\nopinion, I regard this as queer. I have seen doubloons before now in my\nvoyagings; your doubloons of old Spain, your doubloons of Peru, your doubloons\nof Chili, your doubloons of Bolivia, your doubloons of Popayan; with plenty of\ngold moidores and pistoles, and joes, and half joes, and quarter joes. What then\nshould there be in this doubloon of the Equator that is so killing wonderful? By\nGolconda! let me read it once. Halloa! here’s signs and wonders truly! That,\nnow, is what old Bowditch in his Epitome calls the zodiac, and what my almanac\nbelow calls ditto. I’ll get the almanac and as I have heard devils can be raised\nwith Daboll’s arithmetic, I’ll try my hand at raising a meaning out of these\nqueer curvicues here with the Massachusetts calendar. Here’s the book. Let’s see\nnow. Signs and wonders; and the sun, he’s always among ’em. Hem, hem, hem; here\nthey are—here they go—all alive:—Aries, or the Ram; Taurus, or the Bull and\nJimimi! here’s Gemini himself, or the Twins. Well; the sun he wheels among ’em.\nAye, here on the coin he’s just crossing the threshold between two of twelve\nsitting-rooms all in a ring. Book! you lie there; the fact is, you books must\nknow your places. You’ll do to give us the bare words and facts, but we come in\nto supply the thoughts. That’s my small experience, so far as the Massachusetts\ncalendar, and Bowditch’s navigator, and Daboll’s arithmetic go. Signs and\nwonders, eh? Pity if there is nothing wonderful in signs, and significant in\nwonders! There’s a clue somewhere; wait a bit; hist—hark! By Jove, I have it!\nLook you, Doubloon, your zodiac here is the life of man in one round chapter;\nand now I’ll read it off, straight out of the book. Come, Almanack! To begin:\nthere’s Aries, or the Ram—lecherous dog, he begets us; then, Taurus, or the\nBull—he bumps us the first thing; then Gemini, or the Twins—that is, Virtue and\nVice; we try to reach Virtue, when lo! comes Cancer the Crab, and drags us back;\nand here, going from Virtue, Leo, a roaring Lion, lies in the path—he gives a\nfew fierce bites and surly dabs with his paw; we escape, and hail Virgo, the\nVirgin! that’s our first love; we marry and think to be happy for aye, when pop\ncomes Libra, or the Scales—happiness weighed and found wanting; and while we are\nvery sad about that, Lord! how we suddenly jump, as Scorpio, or the Scorpion,\nstings us in the rear; we are curing the wound, when whang come the arrows all\nround; Sagittarius, or the Archer, is amusing himself. As we pluck out the\nshafts, stand aside! here’s the battering-ram, Capricornus, or the Goat; full\ntilt, he comes rushing, and headlong we are tossed; when Aquarius, or the\nWater-bearer, pours out his whole deluge and drowns us; and to wind up with\nPisces, or the Fishes, we sleep. There’s a sermon now, writ in high heaven, and\nthe sun goes through it every year, and yet comes out of it all alive and\nhearty. Jollily he, aloft there, wheels through toil and trouble; and so, alow\nhere, does jolly Stubb. Oh, jolly’s the word for aye! Adieu, Doubloon! But stop;\nhere comes little King-Post; dodge round the try-works, now, and let’s hear what\nhe’ll have to say. There; he’s before it; he’ll out with something presently.\nSo, so; he’s beginning.”\n\n“I see nothing here, but a round thing made of gold, and whoever raises a\ncertain whale, this round thing belongs to him. So, what’s all this staring been\nabout? It is worth sixteen dollars, that’s true; and at two cents the cigar,\nthat’s nine hundred and sixty cigars. I won’t smoke dirty pipes like Stubb, but\nI like cigars, and here’s nine hundred and sixty of them; so here goes Flask\naloft to spy ’em out.”\n\n“Shall I call that wise or foolish, now; if it be really wise it has a foolish\nlook to it; yet, if it be really foolish, then has it a sort of wiseish look to\nit. But, avast; here comes our old Manxman—the old hearse-driver, he must have\nbeen, that is, before he took to the sea. He luffs up before the doubloon;\nhalloa, and goes round on the other side of the mast; why, there’s a horse-shoe\nnailed on that side; and now he’s back again; what does that mean? Hark! he’s\nmuttering—voice like an old worn-out coffee-mill. Prick ears, and listen!”\n\n“If the White Whale be raised, it must be in a month and a day, when the sun\nstands in some one of these signs. I’ve studied signs, and know their marks;\nthey were taught me two score years ago, by the old witch in Copenhagen. Now, in\nwhat sign will the sun then be? The horse-shoe sign; for there it is, right\nopposite the gold. And what’s the horse-shoe sign? The lion is the horse-shoe\nsign—the roaring and devouring lion. Ship, old ship! my old head shakes to think\nof thee.”\n\n“There’s another rendering now; but still one text. All sorts of men in one kind\nof world, you see. Dodge again! here comes Queequeg—all tattooing—looks like the\nsigns of the Zodiac himself. What says the Cannibal? As I live he’s comparing\nnotes; looking at his thigh bone; thinks the sun is in the thigh, or in the\ncalf, or in the bowels, I suppose, as the old women talk Surgeon’s Astronomy in\nthe back country. And by Jove, he’s found something there in the vicinity of his\nthigh—I guess it’s Sagittarius, or the Archer. No: he don’t know what to make of\nthe doubloon; he takes it for an old button off some king’s trowsers. But, aside\nagain! here comes that ghost-devil, Fedallah; tail coiled out of sight as usual,\noakum in the toes of his pumps as usual. What does he say, with that look of\nhis? Ah, only makes a sign to the sign and bows himself; there is a sun on the\ncoin—fire worshipper, depend upon it. Ho! more and more. This way comes Pip—poor\nboy! would he had died, or I; he’s half horrible to me. He too has been watching\nall of these interpreters—myself included—and look now, he comes to read, with\nthat unearthly idiot face. Stand away again and hear him. Hark!”\n\n“I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.”\n\n“Upon my soul, he’s been studying Murray’s Grammar! Improving his mind, poor\nfellow! But what’s that he says now—hist!”\n\n“I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.”\n\n“Why, he’s getting it by heart—hist! again.”\n\n“I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.”\n\n“Well, that’s funny.”\n\n“And I, you, and he; and we, ye, and they, are all bats; and I’m a crow,\nespecially when I stand a’top of this pine tree here. Caw! caw! caw! caw! caw!\ncaw! Ain’t I a crow? And where’s the scare-crow? There he stands; two bones\nstuck into a pair of old trowsers, and two more poked into the sleeves of an old\njacket.”\n\n“Wonder if he means me?—complimentary!—poor lad!—I could go hang myself. Any\nway, for the present, I’ll quit Pip’s vicinity. I can stand the rest, for they\nhave plain wits; but he’s too crazy-witty for my sanity. So, so, I leave him\nmuttering.”\n\n“Here’s the ship’s navel, this doubloon here, and they are all on fire to\nunscrew it. But, unscrew your navel, and what’s the consequence? Then again, if\nit stays here, that is ugly, too, for when aught’s nailed to the mast it’s a\nsign that things grow desperate. Ha, ha! old Ahab! the White Whale; he’ll nail\nye! This is a pine tree. My father, in old Tolland county, cut down a pine tree\nonce, and found a silver ring grown over in it; some old darkey’s wedding ring.\nHow did it get there? And so they’ll say in the resurrection, when they come to\nfish up this old mast, and find a doubloon lodged in it, with bedded oysters for\nthe shaggy bark. Oh, the gold! the precious, precious, gold! the green miser’ll\nhoard ye soon! Hish! hish! God goes ’mong the worlds blackberrying. Cook! ho,\ncook! and cook us! Jenny! hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Jenny, Jenny! and get your\nhoe-cake done!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 100. LEG AND ARM.\n\n\nTHE PEQUOD, OF NANTUCKET, MEETS THE SAMUEL ENDERBY, OF LONDON.\n\n“Ship, ahoy! Hast seen the White Whale?”\n\nSo cried Ahab, once more hailing a ship showing English colours, bearing down\nunder the stern. Trumpet to mouth, the old man was standing in his hoisted\nquarter-boat, his ivory leg plainly revealed to the stranger captain, who was\ncarelessly reclining in his own boat’s bow. He was a darkly-tanned, burly,\ngood-natured, fine-looking man, of sixty or thereabouts, dressed in a spacious\nroundabout, that hung round him in festoons of blue pilot-cloth; and one empty\narm of this jacket streamed behind him like the broidered arm of a hussar’s\nsurcoat.\n\n“Hast seen the White Whale?”\n\n“See you this?” and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it, he held up\na white arm of sperm whale bone, terminating in a wooden head like a mallet.\n\n“Man my boat!” cried Ahab, impetuously, and tossing about the oars near\nhim—“Stand by to lower!”\n\nIn less than a minute, without quitting his little craft, he and his crew were\ndropped to the water, and were soon alongside of the stranger. But here a\ncurious difficulty presented itself. In the excitement of the moment, Ahab had\nforgotten that since the loss of his leg he had never once stepped on board of\nany vessel at sea but his own, and then it was always by an ingenious and very\nhandy mechanical contrivance peculiar to the Pequod, and a thing not to be\nrigged and shipped in any other vessel at a moment’s warning. Now, it is no very\neasy matter for anybody—except those who are almost hourly used to it, like\nwhalemen—to clamber up a ship’s side from a boat on the open sea; for the great\nswells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks, and then instantaneously\ndrop it half way down to the kelson. So, deprived of one leg, and the strange\nship of course being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention, Ahab now\nfound himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again; hopelessly eyeing the\nuncertain changeful height he could hardly hope to attain.\n\nIt has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward circumstance that\nbefell him, and which indirectly sprang from his luckless mishap, almost\ninvariably irritated or exasperated Ahab. And in the present instance, all this\nwas heightened by the sight of the two officers of the strange ship, leaning\nover the side, by the perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there, and swinging\ntowards him a pair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did not\nseem to bethink them that a one-legged man must be too much of a cripple to use\ntheir sea bannisters. But this awkwardness only lasted a minute, because the\nstrange captain, observing at a glance how affairs stood, cried out, “I see, I\nsee!—avast heaving there! Jump, boys, and swing over the cutting-tackle.”\n\nAs good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a day or two\nprevious, and the great tackles were still aloft, and the massive curved\nblubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the end. This was quickly\nlowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it all, slid his solitary thigh into\nthe curve of the hook (it was like sitting in the fluke of an anchor, or the\ncrotch of an apple tree), and then giving the word, held himself fast, and at\nthe same time also helped to hoist his own weight, by pulling hand-over-hand\nupon one of the running parts of the tackle. Soon he was carefully swung inside\nthe high bulwarks, and gently landed upon the capstan head. With his ivory arm\nfrankly thrust forth in welcome, the other captain advanced, and Ahab, putting\nout his ivory leg, and crossing the ivory arm (like two sword-fish blades) cried\nout in his walrus way, “Aye, aye, hearty! let us shake bones together!—an arm\nand a leg!—an arm that never can shrink, d’ye see; and a leg that never can run.\nWhere did’st thou see the White Whale?—how long ago?”\n\n“The White Whale,” said the Englishman, pointing his ivory arm towards the East,\nand taking a rueful sight along it, as if it had been a telescope; “there I saw\nhim, on the Line, last season.”\n\n“And he took that arm off, did he?” asked Ahab, now sliding down from the\ncapstan, and resting on the Englishman’s shoulder, as he did so.\n\n“Aye, he was the cause of it, at least; and that leg, too?”\n\n“Spin me the yarn,” said Ahab; “how was it?”\n\n“It was the first time in my life that I ever cruised on the Line,” began the\nEnglishman. “I was ignorant of the White Whale at that time. Well, one day we\nlowered for a pod of four or five whales, and my boat fastened to one of them; a\nregular circus horse he was, too, that went milling and milling round so, that\nmy boat’s crew could only trim dish, by sitting all their sterns on the outer\ngunwale. Presently up breaches from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great\nwhale, with a milky-white head and hump, all crows’ feet and wrinkles.”\n\n“It was he, it was he!” cried Ahab, suddenly letting out his suspended breath.\n\n“And harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin.”\n\n“Aye, aye—they were mine—my irons,” cried Ahab, exultingly—“but on!”\n\n“Give me a chance, then,” said the Englishman, good-humoredly. “Well, this old\ngreat-grandfather, with the white head and hump, runs all afoam into the pod,\nand goes to snapping furiously at my fast-line!\n\n“Aye, I see!—wanted to part it; free the fast-fish—an old trick—I know him.”\n\n“How it was exactly,” continued the one-armed commander, “I do not know; but in\nbiting the line, it got foul of his teeth, caught there somehow; but we didn’t\nknow it then; so that when we afterwards pulled on the line, bounce we came\nplump on to his hump! instead of the other whale’s; that went off to windward,\nall fluking. Seeing how matters stood, and what a noble great whale it was—the\nnoblest and biggest I ever saw, sir, in my life—I resolved to capture him, spite\nof the boiling rage he seemed to be in. And thinking the hap-hazard line would\nget loose, or the tooth it was tangled to might draw (for I have a devil of a\nboat’s crew for a pull on a whale-line); seeing all this, I say, I jumped into\nmy first mate’s boat—Mr. Mounttop’s here (by the way, Captain—Mounttop;\nMounttop—the captain);—as I was saying, I jumped into Mounttop’s boat, which,\nd’ye see, was gunwale and gunwale with mine, then; and snatching the first\nharpoon, let this old great-grandfather have it. But, Lord, look you, sir—hearts\nand souls alive, man—the next instant, in a jiff, I was blind as a bat—both eyes\nout—all befogged and bedeadened with black foam—the whale’s tail looming\nstraight up out of it, perpendicular in the air, like a marble steeple. No use\nsterning all, then; but as I was groping at midday, with a blinding sun, all\ncrown-jewels; as I was groping, I say, after the second iron, to toss it\noverboard—down comes the tail like a Lima tower, cutting my boat in two, leaving\neach half in splinters; and, flukes first, the white hump backed through the\nwreck, as though it was all chips. We all struck out. To escape his terrible\nflailings, I seized hold of my harpoon-pole sticking in him, and for a moment\nclung to that like a sucking fish. But a combing sea dashed me off, and at the\nsame instant, the fish, taking one good dart forwards, went down like a flash;\nand the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near me caught me here”\n(clapping his hand just below his shoulder); “yes, caught me just here, I say,\nand bore me down to Hell’s flames, I was thinking; when, when, all of a sudden,\nthank the good God, the barb ript its way along the flesh—clear along the whole\nlength of my arm—came out nigh my wrist, and up I floated;—and that gentleman\nthere will tell you the rest (by the way, captain—Dr. Bunger, ship’s surgeon:\nBunger, my lad,—the captain). Now, Bunger boy, spin your part of the yarn.”\n\nThe professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out, had been all the time\nstanding near them, with nothing specific visible, to denote his gentlemanly\nrank on board. His face was an exceedingly round but sober one; he was dressed\nin a faded blue woollen frock or shirt, and patched trowsers; and had thus far\nbeen dividing his attention between a marlingspike he held in one hand, and a\npill-box held in the other, occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory\nlimbs of the two crippled captains. But, at his superior’s introduction of him\nto Ahab, he politely bowed, and straightway went on to do his captain’s bidding.\n\n“It was a shocking bad wound,” began the whale-surgeon; “and, taking my advice,\nCaptain Boomer here, stood our old Sammy—”\n\n“Samuel Enderby is the name of my ship,” interrupted the one-armed captain,\naddressing Ahab; “go on, boy.”\n\n“Stood our old Sammy off to the northward, to get out of the blazing hot weather\nthere on the Line. But it was no use—I did all I could; sat up with him nights;\nwas very severe with him in the matter of diet—”\n\n“Oh, very severe!” chimed in the patient himself; then suddenly altering his\nvoice, “Drinking hot rum toddies with me every night, till he couldn’t see to\nput on the bandages; and sending me to bed, half seas over, about three o’clock\nin the morning. Oh, ye stars! he sat up with me indeed, and was very severe in\nmy diet. Oh! a great watcher, and very dietetically severe, is Dr. Bunger.\n(Bunger, you dog, laugh out! why don’t ye? You know you’re a precious jolly\nrascal.) But, heave ahead, boy, I’d rather be killed by you than kept alive by\nany other man.”\n\n“My captain, you must have ere this perceived, respected sir”—said the\nimperturbable godly-looking Bunger, slightly bowing to Ahab—“is apt to be\nfacetious at times; he spins us many clever things of that sort. But I may as\nwell say—en passant, as the French remark—that I myself—that is to say, Jack\nBunger, late of the reverend clergy—am a strict total abstinence man; I never\ndrink—”\n\n“Water!” cried the captain; “he never drinks it; it’s a sort of fits to him;\nfresh water throws him into the hydrophobia; but go on—go on with the arm\nstory.”\n\n“Yes, I may as well,” said the surgeon, coolly. “I was about observing, sir,\nbefore Captain Boomer’s facetious interruption, that spite of my best and\nseverest endeavors, the wound kept getting worse and worse; the truth was, sir,\nit was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever saw; more than two feet and several\ninches long. I measured it with the lead line. In short, it grew black; I knew\nwhat was threatened, and off it came. But I had no hand in shipping that ivory\narm there; that thing is against all rule”—pointing at it with the\nmarlingspike—“that is the captain’s work, not mine; he ordered the carpenter to\nmake it; he had that club-hammer there put to the end, to knock some one’s\nbrains out with, I suppose, as he tried mine once. He flies into diabolical\npassions sometimes. Do ye see this dent, sir”—removing his hat, and brushing\naside his hair, and exposing a bowl-like cavity in his skull, but which bore not\nthe slightest scarry trace, or any token of ever having been a wound—“Well, the\ncaptain there will tell you how that came here; he knows.”\n\n“No, I don’t,” said the captain, “but his mother did; he was born with it. Oh,\nyou solemn rogue, you—you Bunger! was there ever such another Bunger in the\nwatery world? Bunger, when you die, you ought to die in pickle, you dog; you\nshould be preserved to future ages, you rascal.”\n\n“What became of the White Whale?” now cried Ahab, who thus far had been\nimpatiently listening to this by-play between the two Englishmen.\n\n“Oh!” cried the one-armed captain, “oh, yes! Well; after he sounded, we didn’t\nsee him again for some time; in fact, as I before hinted, I didn’t then know\nwhat whale it was that had served me such a trick, till some time afterwards,\nwhen coming back to the Line, we heard about Moby Dick—as some call him—and then\nI knew it was he.”\n\n“Did’st thou cross his wake again?”\n\n“Twice.”\n\n“But could not fasten?”\n\n“Didn’t want to try to: ain’t one limb enough? What should I do without this\nother arm? And I’m thinking Moby Dick doesn’t bite so much as he swallows.”\n\n“Well, then,” interrupted Bunger, “give him your left arm for bait to get the\nright. Do you know, gentlemen”—very gravely and mathematically bowing to each\nCaptain in succession—“Do you know, gentlemen, that the digestive organs of the\nwhale are so inscrutably constructed by Divine Providence, that it is quite\nimpossible for him to completely digest even a man’s arm? And he knows it too.\nSo that what you take for the White Whale’s malice is only his awkwardness. For\nhe never means to swallow a single limb; he only thinks to terrify by feints.\nBut sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow, formerly a patient of mine in\nCeylon, that making believe swallow jack-knives, once upon a time let one drop\ninto him in good earnest, and there it stayed for a twelvemonth or more; when I\ngave him an emetic, and he heaved it up in small tacks, d’ye see. No possible\nway for him to digest that jack-knife, and fully incorporate it into his general\nbodily system. Yes, Captain Boomer, if you are quick enough about it, and have a\nmind to pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving decent burial to\nthe other, why in that case the arm is yours; only let the whale have another\nchance at you shortly, that’s all.”\n\n“No, thank ye, Bunger,” said the English Captain, “he’s welcome to the arm he\nhas, since I can’t help it, and didn’t know him then; but not to another one. No\nmore White Whales for me; I’ve lowered for him once, and that has satisfied me.\nThere would be great glory in killing him, I know that; and there is a ship-load\nof precious sperm in him, but, hark ye, he’s best let alone; don’t you think so,\nCaptain?”—glancing at the ivory leg.\n\n“He is. But he will still be hunted, for all that. What is best let alone, that\naccursed thing is not always what least allures. He’s all a magnet! How long\nsince thou saw’st him last? Which way heading?”\n\n“Bless my soul, and curse the foul fiend’s,” cried Bunger, stoopingly walking\nround Ahab, and like a dog, strangely snuffing; “this man’s blood—bring the\nthermometer!—it’s at the boiling point!—his pulse makes these planks\nbeat!—sir!”—taking a lancet from his pocket, and drawing near to Ahab’s arm.\n\n“Avast!” roared Ahab, dashing him against the bulwarks—“Man the boat! Which way\nheading?”\n\n“Good God!” cried the English Captain, to whom the question was put. “What’s the\nmatter? He was heading east, I think.—Is your Captain crazy?” whispering\nFedallah.\n\nBut Fedallah, putting a finger on his lip, slid over the bulwarks to take the\nboat’s steering oar, and Ahab, swinging the cutting-tackle towards him,\ncommanded the ship’s sailors to stand by to lower.\n\nIn a moment he was standing in the boat’s stern, and the Manilla men were\nspringing to their oars. In vain the English Captain hailed him. With back to\nthe stranger ship, and face set like a flint to his own, Ahab stood upright till\nalongside of the Pequod.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 101. THE DECANTER.\n\nEre the English ship fades from sight, be it set down here, that she hailed from\nLondon, and was named after the late Samuel Enderby, merchant of that city, the\noriginal of the famous whaling house of Enderby & Sons; a house which in my poor\nwhaleman’s opinion, comes not far behind the united royal houses of the Tudors\nand Bourbons, in point of real historical interest. How long, prior to the year\nof our Lord 1775, this great whaling house was in existence, my numerous\nfish-documents do not make plain; but in that year (1775) it fitted out the\nfirst English ships that ever regularly hunted the Sperm Whale; though for some\nscore of years previous (ever since 1726) our valiant Coffins and Maceys of\nNantucket and the Vineyard had in large fleets pursued that Leviathan, but only\nin the North and South Atlantic: not elsewhere. Be it distinctly recorded here,\nthat the Nantucketers were the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized\nsteel the great Sperm Whale; and that for half a century they were the only\npeople of the whole globe who so harpooned him.\n\nIn 1778, a fine ship, the Amelia, fitted out for the express purpose, and at the\nsole charge of the vigorous Enderbys, boldly rounded Cape Horn, and was the\nfirst among the nations to lower a whale-boat of any sort in the great South\nSea. The voyage was a skilful and lucky one; and returning to her berth with her\nhold full of the precious sperm, the Amelia’s example was soon followed by other\nships, English and American, and thus the vast Sperm Whale grounds of the\nPacific were thrown open. But not content with this good deed, the indefatigable\nhouse again bestirred itself: Samuel and all his Sons—how many, their mother\nonly knows—and under their immediate auspices, and partly, I think, at their\nexpense, the British government was induced to send the sloop-of-war Rattler on\na whaling voyage of discovery into the South Sea. Commanded by a naval\nPost-Captain, the Rattler made a rattling voyage of it, and did some service;\nhow much does not appear. But this is not all. In 1819, the same house fitted\nout a discovery whale ship of their own, to go on a tasting cruise to the remote\nwaters of Japan. That ship—well called the “Syren”—made a noble experimental\ncruise; and it was thus that the great Japanese Whaling Ground first became\ngenerally known. The Syren in this famous voyage was commanded by a Captain\nCoffin, a Nantucketer.\n\nAll honor to the Enderbies, therefore, whose house, I think, exists to the\npresent day; though doubtless the original Samuel must long ago have slipped his\ncable for the great South Sea of the other world.\n\nThe ship named after him was worthy of the honor, being a very fast sailer and a\nnoble craft every way. I boarded her once at midnight somewhere off the\nPatagonian coast, and drank good flip down in the forecastle. It was a fine gam\nwe had, and they were all trumps—every soul on board. A short life to them, and\na jolly death. And that fine gam I had—long, very long after old Ahab touched\nher planks with his ivory heel—it minds me of the noble, solid, Saxon\nhospitality of that ship; and may my parson forget me, and the devil remember\nme, if I ever lose sight of it. Flip? Did I say we had flip? Yes, and we flipped\nit at the rate of ten gallons the hour; and when the squall came (for it’s\nsqually off there by Patagonia), and all hands—visitors and all—were called to\nreef topsails, we were so top-heavy that we had to swing each other aloft in\nbowlines; and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our jackets into the sails, so\nthat we hung there, reefed fast in the howling gale, a warning example to all\ndrunken tars. However, the masts did not go overboard; and by and by we\nscrambled down, so sober, that we had to pass the flip again, though the savage\nsalt spray bursting down the forecastle scuttle, rather too much diluted and\npickled it to my taste.\n\nThe beef was fine—tough, but with body in it. They said it was bull-beef;\nothers, that it was dromedary beef; but I do not know, for certain, how that\nwas. They had dumplings too; small, but substantial, symmetrically globular, and\nindestructible dumplings. I fancied that you could feel them, and roll them\nabout in you after they were swallowed. If you stooped over too far forward, you\nrisked their pitching out of you like billiard-balls. The bread—but that\ncouldn’t be helped; besides, it was an anti-scorbutic; in short, the bread\ncontained the only fresh fare they had. But the forecastle was not very light,\nand it was very easy to step over into a dark corner when you ate it. But all in\nall, taking her from truck to helm, considering the dimensions of the cook’s\nboilers, including his own live parchment boilers; fore and aft, I say, the\nSamuel Enderby was a jolly ship; of good fare and plenty; fine flip and strong;\ncrack fellows all, and capital from boot heels to hat-band.\n\nBut why was it, think ye, that the Samuel Enderby, and some other English\nwhalers I know of—not all though—were such famous, hospitable ships; that passed\nround the beef, and the bread, and the can, and the joke; and were not soon\nweary of eating, and drinking, and laughing? I will tell you. The abounding good\ncheer of these English whalers is matter for historical research. Nor have I\nbeen at all sparing of historical whale research, when it has seemed needed.\n\nThe English were preceded in the whale fishery by the Hollanders, Zealanders,\nand Danes; from whom they derived many terms still extant in the fishery; and\nwhat is yet more, their fat old fashions, touching plenty to eat and drink. For,\nas a general thing, the English merchant-ship scrimps her crew; but not so the\nEnglish whaler. Hence, in the English, this thing of whaling good cheer is not\nnormal and natural, but incidental and particular; and, therefore, must have\nsome special origin, which is here pointed out, and will be still further\nelucidated.\n\nDuring my researches in the Leviathanic histories, I stumbled upon an ancient\nDutch volume, which, by the musty whaling smell of it, I knew must be about\nwhalers. The title was, “Dan Coopman,” wherefore I concluded that this must be\nthe invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdam cooper in the fishery, as every whale\nship must carry its cooper. I was reinforced in this opinion by seeing that it\nwas the production of one “Fitz Swackhammer.” But my friend Dr. Snodhead, a very\nlearned man, professor of Low Dutch and High German in the college of Santa\nClaus and St. Pott’s, to whom I handed the work for translation, giving him a\nbox of sperm candles for his trouble—this same Dr. Snodhead, so soon as he spied\nthe book, assured me that “Dan Coopman” did not mean “The Cooper,” but “The\nMerchant.” In short, this ancient and learned Low Dutch book treated of the\ncommerce of Holland; and, among other subjects, contained a very interesting\naccount of its whale fishery. And in this chapter it was, headed, “Smeer,” or\n“Fat,” that I found a long detailed list of the outfits for the larders and\ncellars of 180 sail of Dutch whalemen; from which list, as translated by Dr.\nSnodhead, I transcribe the following:\n\n400,000 lbs. of beef. 60,000 lbs. Friesland pork. 150,000 lbs. of stock fish.\n550,000 lbs. of biscuit. 72,000 lbs. of soft bread. 2,800 firkins of butter.\n20,000 lbs. Texel & Leyden cheese. 144,000 lbs. cheese (probably an inferior\narticle). 550 ankers of Geneva. 10,800 barrels of beer.\n\nMost statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading; not so in the present\ncase, however, where the reader is flooded with whole pipes, barrels, quarts,\nand gills of good gin and good cheer.\n\nAt the time, I devoted three days to the studious digesting of all this beer,\nbeef, and bread, during which many profound thoughts were incidentally suggested\nto me, capable of a transcendental and Platonic application; and, furthermore, I\ncompiled supplementary tables of my own, touching the probable quantity of\nstock-fish, etc., consumed by every Low Dutch harpooneer in that ancient\nGreenland and Spitzbergen whale fishery. In the first place, the amount of\nbutter, and Texel and Leyden cheese consumed, seems amazing. I impute it,\nthough, to their naturally unctuous natures, being rendered still more unctuous\nby the nature of their vocation, and especially by their pursuing their game in\nthose frigid Polar Seas, on the very coasts of that Esquimaux country where the\nconvivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of train oil.\n\nThe quantity of beer, too, is very large, 10,800 barrels. Now, as those polar\nfisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that climate, so that\nthe whole cruise of one of these Dutch whalemen, including the short voyage to\nand from the Spitzbergen sea, did not much exceed three months, say, and\nreckoning 30 men to each of their fleet of 180 sail, we have 5,400 Low Dutch\nseamen in all; therefore, I say, we have precisely two barrels of beer per man,\nfor a twelve weeks’ allowance, exclusive of his fair proportion of that 550\nankers of gin. Now, whether these gin and beer harpooneers, so fuddled as one\nmight fancy them to have been, were the right sort of men to stand up in a\nboat’s head, and take good aim at flying whales; this would seem somewhat\nimprobable. Yet they did aim at them, and hit them too. But this was very far\nNorth, be it remembered, where beer agrees well with the constitution; upon the\nEquator, in our southern fishery, beer would be apt to make the harpooneer\nsleepy at the mast-head and boozy in his boat; and grievous loss might ensue to\nNantucket and New Bedford.\n\nBut no more; enough has been said to show that the old Dutch whalers of two or\nthree centuries ago were high livers; and that the English whalers have not\nneglected so excellent an example. For, say they, when cruising in an empty\nship, if you can get nothing better out of the world, get a good dinner out of\nit, at least. And this empties the decanter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 102. A BOWER IN THE ARSACIDES.\n\nHitherto, in descriptively treating of the Sperm Whale, I have chiefly dwelt\nupon the marvels of his outer aspect; or separately and in detail upon some few\ninterior structural features. But to a large and thorough sweeping comprehension\nof him, it behooves me now to unbutton him still further, and untagging the\npoints of his hose, unbuckling his garters, and casting loose the hooks and the\neyes of the joints of his innermost bones, set him before you in his ultimatum;\nthat is to say, in his unconditional skeleton.\n\nBut how now, Ishmael? How is it, that you, a mere oarsman in the fishery,\npretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the whale? Did erudite\nStubb, mounted upon your capstan, deliver lectures on the anatomy of the\nCetacea; and by help of the windlass, hold up a specimen rib for exhibition?\nExplain thyself, Ishmael. Can you land a full-grown whale on your deck for\nexamination, as a cook dishes a roast-pig? Surely not. A veritable witness have\nyou hitherto been, Ishmael; but have a care how you seize the privilege of Jonah\nalone; the privilege of discoursing upon the joists and beams; the rafters,\nridge-pole, sleepers, and under-pinnings, making up the frame-work of leviathan;\nand belike of the tallow-vats, dairy-rooms, butteries, and cheeseries in his\nbowels.\n\nI confess, that since Jonah, few whalemen have penetrated very far beneath the\nskin of the adult whale; nevertheless, I have been blessed with an opportunity\nto dissect him in miniature. In a ship I belonged to, a small cub Sperm Whale\nwas once bodily hoisted to the deck for his poke or bag, to make sheaths for the\nbarbs of the harpoons, and for the heads of the lances. Think you I let that\nchance go, without using my boat-hatchet and jack-knife, and breaking the seal\nand reading all the contents of that young cub?\n\nAnd as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their gigantic,\nfull grown development, for that rare knowledge I am indebted to my late royal\nfriend Tranquo, king of Tranque, one of the Arsacides. For being at Tranque,\nyears ago, when attached to the trading-ship Dey of Algiers, I was invited to\nspend part of the Arsacidean holidays with the lord of Tranque, at his retired\npalm villa at Pupella; a sea-side glen not very far distant from what our\nsailors called Bamboo-Town, his capital.\n\nAmong many other fine qualities, my royal friend Tranquo, being gifted with a\ndevout love for all matters of barbaric vertu, had brought together in Pupella\nwhatever rare things the more ingenious of his people could invent; chiefly\ncarved woods of wonderful devices, chiselled shells, inlaid spears, costly\npaddles, aromatic canoes; and all these distributed among whatever natural\nwonders, the wonder-freighted, tribute-rendering waves had cast upon his shores.\n\nChief among these latter was a great Sperm Whale, which, after an unusually long\nraging gale, had been found dead and stranded, with his head against a cocoa-nut\ntree, whose plumage-like, tufted droopings seemed his verdant jet. When the vast\nbody had at last been stripped of its fathom-deep enfoldings, and the bones\nbecome dust dry in the sun, then the skeleton was carefully transported up the\nPupella glen, where a grand temple of lordly palms now sheltered it.\n\nThe ribs were hung with trophies; the vertebræ were carved with Arsacidean\nannals, in strange hieroglyphics; in the skull, the priests kept up an\nunextinguished aromatic flame, so that the mystic head again sent forth its\nvapory spout; while, suspended from a bough, the terrific lower jaw vibrated\nover all the devotees, like the hair-hung sword that so affrighted Damocles.\n\nIt was a wondrous sight. The wood was green as mosses of the Icy Glen; the trees\nstood high and haughty, feeling their living sap; the industrious earth beneath\nwas as a weaver’s loom, with a gorgeous carpet on it, whereof the ground-vine\ntendrils formed the warp and woof, and the living flowers the figures. All the\ntrees, with all their laden branches; all the shrubs, and ferns, and grasses;\nthe message-carrying air; all these unceasingly were active. Through the lacings\nof the leaves, the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving the unwearied\nverdure. Oh, busy weaver! unseen weaver!—pause!—one word!—whither flows the\nfabric? what palace may it deck? wherefore all these ceaseless toilings? Speak,\nweaver!—stay thy hand!—but one single word with thee! Nay—the shuttle flies—the\nfigures float from forth the loom; the freshet-rushing carpet for ever slides\naway. The weaver-god, he weaves; and by that weaving is he deafened, that he\nhears no mortal voice; and by that humming, we, too, who look on the loom are\ndeafened; and only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that\nspeak through it. For even so it is in all material factories. The spoken words\nthat are inaudible among the flying spindles; those same words are plainly heard\nwithout the walls, bursting from the opened casements. Thereby have villainies\nbeen detected. Ah, mortal! then, be heedful; for so, in all this din of the\ngreat world’s loom, thy subtlest thinkings may be overheard afar.\n\nNow, amid the green, life-restless loom of that Arsacidean wood, the great,\nwhite, worshipped skeleton lay lounging—a gigantic idler! Yet, as the ever-woven\nverdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed around him, the mighty idler seemed\nthe cunning weaver; himself all woven over with the vines; every month assuming\ngreener, fresher verdure; but himself a skeleton. Life folded Death; Death\ntrellised Life; the grim god wived with youthful Life, and begat him\ncurly-headed glories.\n\nNow, when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale, and saw the skull an\naltar, and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real jet had issued, I\nmarvelled that the king should regard a chapel as an object of vertu. He\nlaughed. But more I marvelled that the priests should swear that smoky jet of\nhis was genuine. To and fro I paced before this skeleton—brushed the vines\naside—broke through the ribs—and with a ball of Arsacidean twine, wandered,\neddied long amid its many winding, shaded colonnades and arbours. But soon my\nline was out; and following it back, I emerged from the opening where I entered.\nI saw no living thing within; naught was there but bones.\n\nCutting me a green measuring-rod, I once more dived within the skeleton. From\ntheir arrow-slit in the skull, the priests perceived me taking the altitude of\nthe final rib, “How now!” they shouted; “Dar’st thou measure this our god!\nThat’s for us.” “Aye, priests—well, how long do ye make him, then?” But hereupon\na fierce contest rose among them, concerning feet and inches; they cracked each\nother’s sconces with their yard-sticks—the great skull echoed—and seizing that\nlucky chance, I quickly concluded my own admeasurements.\n\nThese admeasurements I now propose to set before you. But first, be it recorded,\nthat, in this matter, I am not free to utter any fancied measurement I please.\nBecause there are skeleton authorities you can refer to, to test my accuracy.\nThere is a Leviathanic Museum, they tell me, in Hull, England, one of the\nwhaling ports of that country, where they have some fine specimens of fin-backs\nand other whales. Likewise, I have heard that in the museum of Manchester, in\nNew Hampshire, they have what the proprietors call “the only perfect specimen of\na Greenland or River Whale in the United States.” Moreover, at a place in\nYorkshire, England, Burton Constable by name, a certain Sir Clifford Constable\nhas in his possession the skeleton of a Sperm Whale, but of moderate size, by no\nmeans of the full-grown magnitude of my friend King Tranquo’s.\n\nIn both cases, the stranded whales to which these two skeletons belonged, were\noriginally claimed by their proprietors upon similar grounds. King Tranquo\nseizing his because he wanted it; and Sir Clifford, because he was lord of the\nseignories of those parts. Sir Clifford’s whale has been articulated throughout;\nso that, like a great chest of drawers, you can open and shut him, in all his\nbony cavities—spread out his ribs like a gigantic fan—and swing all day upon his\nlower jaw. Locks are to be put upon some of his trap-doors and shutters; and a\nfootman will show round future visitors with a bunch of keys at his side. Sir\nClifford thinks of charging twopence for a peep at the whispering gallery in the\nspinal column; threepence to hear the echo in the hollow of his cerebellum; and\nsixpence for the unrivalled view from his forehead.\n\nThe skeleton dimensions I shall now proceed to set down are copied verbatim from\nmy right arm, where I had them tattooed; as in my wild wanderings at that\nperiod, there was no other secure way of preserving such valuable statistics.\nBut as I was crowded for space, and wished the other parts of my body to remain\na blank page for a poem I was then composing—at least, what untattooed parts\nmight remain—I did not trouble myself with the odd inches; nor, indeed, should\ninches at all enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 103. MEASUREMENT OF THE WHALE’S SKELETON.\n\nIn the first place, I wish to lay before you a particular, plain statement,\ntouching the living bulk of this leviathan, whose skeleton we are briefly to\nexhibit. Such a statement may prove useful here.\n\nAccording to a careful calculation I have made, and which I partly base upon\nCaptain Scoresby’s estimate, of seventy tons for the largest sized Greenland\nwhale of sixty feet in length; according to my careful calculation, I say, a\nSperm Whale of the largest magnitude, between eighty-five and ninety feet in\nlength, and something less than forty feet in its fullest circumference, such a\nwhale will weigh at least ninety tons; so that, reckoning thirteen men to a ton,\nhe would considerably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one\nthousand one hundred inhabitants.\n\nThink you not then that brains, like yoked cattle, should be put to this\nleviathan, to make him at all budge to any landsman’s imagination?\n\nHaving already in various ways put before you his skull, spout-hole, jaw, teeth,\ntail, forehead, fins, and divers other parts, I shall now simply point out what\nis most interesting in the general bulk of his unobstructed bones. But as the\ncolossal skull embraces so very large a proportion of the entire extent of the\nskeleton; as it is by far the most complicated part; and as nothing is to be\nrepeated concerning it in this chapter, you must not fail to carry it in your\nmind, or under your arm, as we proceed, otherwise you will not gain a complete\nnotion of the general structure we are about to view.\n\nIn length, the Sperm Whale’s skeleton at Tranque measured seventy-two feet; so\nthat when fully invested and extended in life, he must have been ninety feet\nlong; for in the whale, the skeleton loses about one fifth in length compared\nwith the living body. Of this seventy-two feet, his skull and jaw comprised some\ntwenty feet, leaving some fifty feet of plain back-bone. Attached to this\nback-bone, for something less than a third of its length, was the mighty\ncircular basket of ribs which once enclosed his vitals.\n\nTo me this vast ivory-ribbed chest, with the long, unrelieved spine, extending\nfar away from it in a straight line, not a little resembled the hull of a great\nship new-laid upon the stocks, when only some twenty of her naked bow-ribs are\ninserted, and the keel is otherwise, for the time, but a long, disconnected\ntimber.\n\nThe ribs were ten on a side. The first, to begin from the neck, was nearly six\nfeet long; the second, third, and fourth were each successively longer, till you\ncame to the climax of the fifth, or one of the middle ribs, which measured eight\nfeet and some inches. From that part, the remaining ribs diminished, till the\ntenth and last only spanned five feet and some inches. In general thickness,\nthey all bore a seemly correspondence to their length. The middle ribs were the\nmost arched. In some of the Arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay\nfootpath bridges over small streams.\n\nIn considering these ribs, I could not but be struck anew with the circumstance,\nso variously repeated in this book, that the skeleton of the whale is by no\nmeans the mould of his invested form. The largest of the Tranque ribs, one of\nthe middle ones, occupied that part of the fish which, in life, is greatest in\ndepth. Now, the greatest depth of the invested body of this particular whale\nmust have been at least sixteen feet; whereas, the corresponding rib measured\nbut little more than eight feet. So that this rib only conveyed half of the true\nnotion of the living magnitude of that part. Besides, for some way, where I now\nsaw but a naked spine, all that had been once wrapped round with tons of added\nbulk in flesh, muscle, blood, and bowels. Still more, for the ample fins, I here\nsaw but a few disordered joints; and in place of the weighty and majestic, but\nboneless flukes, an utter blank!\n\nHow vain and foolish, then, thought I, for timid untravelled man to try to\ncomprehend aright this wondrous whale, by merely poring over his dead attenuated\nskeleton, stretched in this peaceful wood. No. Only in the heart of quickest\nperils; only when within the eddyings of his angry flukes; only on the profound\nunbounded sea, can the fully invested whale be truly and livingly found out.\n\nBut the spine. For that, the best way we can consider it is, with a crane, to\npile its bones high up on end. No speedy enterprise. But now it’s done, it looks\nmuch like Pompey’s Pillar.\n\nThere are forty and odd vertebræ in all, which in the skeleton are not locked\ntogether. They mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on a Gothic spire,\nforming solid courses of heavy masonry. The largest, a middle one, is in width\nsomething less than three feet, and in depth more than four. The smallest, where\nthe spine tapers away into the tail, is only two inches in width, and looks\nsomething like a white billiard-ball. I was told that there were still smaller\nones, but they had been lost by some little cannibal urchins, the priest’s\nchildren, who had stolen them to play marbles with. Thus we see how that the\nspine of even the hugest of living things tapers off at last into simple child’s\nplay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 104. THE FOSSIL WHALE.\n\nFrom his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon to\nenlarge, amplify, and generally expatiate. Would you, you could not compress\nhim. By good rights he should only be treated of in imperial folio. Not to tell\nover again his furlongs from spiracle to tail, and the yards he measures about\nthe waist; only think of the gigantic involutions of his intestines, where they\nlie in him like great cables and hawsers coiled away in the subterranean\norlop-deck of a line-of-battle-ship.\n\nSince I have undertaken to manhandle this Leviathan, it behooves me to approve\nmyself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise; not overlooking the minutest\nseminal germs of his blood, and spinning him out to the uttermost coil of his\nbowels. Having already described him in most of his present habitatory and\nanatomical peculiarities, it now remains to magnify him in an archæological,\nfossiliferous, and antediluvian point of view. Applied to any other creature\nthan the Leviathan—to an ant or a flea—such portly terms might justly be deemed\nunwarrantably grandiloquent. But when Leviathan is the text, the case is\naltered. Fain am I to stagger to this emprise under the weightiest words of the\ndictionary. And here be it said, that whenever it has been convenient to consult\none in the course of these dissertations, I have invariably used a huge quarto\nedition of Johnson, expressly purchased for that purpose; because that famous\nlexicographer’s uncommon personal bulk more fitted him to compile a lexicon to\nbe used by a whale author like me.\n\nOne often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject, though it may\nseem but an ordinary one. How, then, with me, writing of this Leviathan?\nUnconsciously my chirography expands into placard capitals. Give me a condor’s\nquill! Give me Vesuvius’ crater for an inkstand! Friends, hold my arms! For in\nthe mere act of penning my thoughts of this Leviathan, they weary me, and make\nme faint with their outreaching comprehensiveness of sweep, as if to include the\nwhole circle of the sciences, and all the generations of whales, and men, and\nmastodons, past, present, and to come, with all the revolving panoramas of\nempire on earth, and throughout the whole universe, not excluding its suburbs.\nSuch, and so magnifying, is the virtue of a large and liberal theme! We expand\nto its bulk. To produce a mighty book, you must choose a mighty theme. No great\nand enduring volume can ever be written on the flea, though many there be who\nhave tried it.\n\nEre entering upon the subject of Fossil Whales, I present my credentials as a\ngeologist, by stating that in my miscellaneous time I have been a stone-mason,\nand also a great digger of ditches, canals and wells, wine-vaults, cellars, and\ncisterns of all sorts. Likewise, by way of preliminary, I desire to remind the\nreader, that while in the earlier geological strata there are found the fossils\nof monsters now almost completely extinct; the subsequent relics discovered in\nwhat are called the Tertiary formations seem the connecting, or at any rate\nintercepted links, between the antichronical creatures, and those whose remote\nposterity are said to have entered the Ark; all the Fossil Whales hitherto\ndiscovered belong to the Tertiary period, which is the last preceding the\nsuperficial formations. And though none of them precisely answer to any known\nspecies of the present time, they are yet sufficiently akin to them in general\nrespects, to justify their taking rank as Cetacean fossils.\n\nDetached broken fossils of pre-adamite whales, fragments of their bones and\nskeletons, have within thirty years past, at various intervals, been found at\nthe base of the Alps, in Lombardy, in France, in England, in Scotland, and in\nthe States of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Among the more curious of\nsuch remains is part of a skull, which in the year 1779 was disinterred in the\nRue Dauphine in Paris, a short street opening almost directly upon the palace of\nthe Tuileries; and bones disinterred in excavating the great docks of Antwerp,\nin Napoleon’s time. Cuvier pronounced these fragments to have belonged to some\nutterly unknown Leviathanic species.\n\nBut by far the most wonderful of all Cetacean relics was the almost complete\nvast skeleton of an extinct monster, found in the year 1842, on the plantation\nof Judge Creagh, in Alabama. The awe-stricken credulous slaves in the vicinity\ntook it for the bones of one of the fallen angels. The Alabama doctors declared\nit a huge reptile, and bestowed upon it the name of Basilosaurus. But some\nspecimen bones of it being taken across the sea to Owen, the English Anatomist,\nit turned out that this alleged reptile was a whale, though of a departed\nspecies. A significant illustration of the fact, again and again repeated in\nthis book, that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but little clue to the shape\nof his fully invested body. So Owen rechristened the monster Zeuglodon; and in\nhis paper read before the London Geological Society, pronounced it, in\nsubstance, one of the most extraordinary creatures which the mutations of the\nglobe have blotted out of existence.\n\nWhen I stand among these mighty Leviathan skeletons, skulls, tusks, jaws, ribs,\nand vertebræ, all characterized by partial resemblances to the existing breeds\nof sea-monsters; but at the same time bearing on the other hand similar\naffinities to the annihilated antichronical Leviathans, their incalculable\nseniors; I am, by a flood, borne back to that wondrous period, ere time itself\ncan be said to have begun; for time began with man. Here Saturn’s grey chaos\nrolls over me, and I obtain dim, shuddering glimpses into those Polar\neternities; when wedged bastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the\nTropics; and in all the 25,000 miles of this world’s circumference, not an\ninhabitable hand’s breadth of land was visible. Then the whole world was the\nwhale’s; and, king of creation, he left his wake along the present lines of the\nAndes and the Himmalehs. Who can show a pedigree like Leviathan? Ahab’s harpoon\nhad shed older blood than the Pharaoh’s. Methuselah seems a school-boy. I look\nround to shake hands with Shem. I am horror-struck at this antemosaic, unsourced\nexistence of the unspeakable terrors of the whale, which, having been before all\ntime, must needs exist after all humane ages are over.\n\nBut not alone has this Leviathan left his pre-adamite traces in the stereotype\nplates of nature, and in limestone and marl bequeathed his ancient bust; but\nupon Egyptian tablets, whose antiquity seems to claim for them an almost\nfossiliferous character, we find the unmistakable print of his fin. In an\napartment of the great temple of Denderah, some fifty years ago, there was\ndiscovered upon the granite ceiling a sculptured and painted planisphere,\nabounding in centaurs, griffins, and dolphins, similar to the grotesque figures\non the celestial globe of the moderns. Gliding among them, old Leviathan swam as\nof yore; was there swimming in that planisphere, centuries before Solomon was\ncradled.\n\nNor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the antiquity of the\nwhale, in his own osseous post-diluvian reality, as set down by the venerable\nJohn Leo, the old Barbary traveller.\n\n“Not far from the Sea-side, they have a Temple, the Rafters and Beams of which\nare made of Whale-Bones; for Whales of a monstrous size are oftentimes cast up\ndead upon that shore. The Common People imagine, that by a secret Power bestowed\nby God upon the Temple, no Whale can pass it without immediate death. But the\ntruth of the Matter is, that on either side of the Temple, there are Rocks that\nshoot two Miles into the Sea, and wound the Whales when they light upon ’em.\nThey keep a Whale’s Rib of an incredible length for a Miracle, which lying upon\nthe Ground with its convex part uppermost, makes an Arch, the Head of which\ncannot be reached by a Man upon a Camel’s Back. This Rib (says John Leo) is said\nto have layn there a hundred Years before I saw it. Their Historians affirm,\nthat a Prophet who prophesy’d of Mahomet, came from this Temple, and some do not\nstand to assert, that the Prophet Jonas was cast forth by the Whale at the Base\nof the Temple.”\n\nIn this Afric Temple of the Whale I leave you, reader, and if you be a\nNantucketer, and a whaleman, you will silently worship there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 105. DOES THE WHALE’S MAGNITUDE DIMINISH?—WILL HE PERISH?\n\nInasmuch, then, as this Leviathan comes floundering down upon us from the\nhead-waters of the Eternities, it may be fitly inquired, whether, in the long\ncourse of his generations, he has not degenerated from the original bulk of his\nsires.\n\nBut upon investigation we find, that not only are the whales of the present day\nsuperior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are found in the Tertiary\nsystem (embracing a distinct geological period prior to man), but of the whales\nfound in that Tertiary system, those belonging to its latter formations exceed\nin size those of its earlier ones.\n\nOf all the pre-adamite whales yet exhumed, by far the largest is the Alabama one\nmentioned in the last chapter, and that was less than seventy feet in length in\nthe skeleton. Whereas, we have already seen, that the tape-measure gives\nseventy-two feet for the skeleton of a large sized modern whale. And I have\nheard, on whalemen’s authority, that Sperm Whales have been captured near a\nhundred feet long at the time of capture.\n\nBut may it not be, that while the whales of the present hour are an advance in\nmagnitude upon those of all previous geological periods; may it not be, that\nsince Adam’s time they have degenerated?\n\nAssuredly, we must conclude so, if we are to credit the accounts of such\ngentlemen as Pliny, and the ancient naturalists generally. For Pliny tells us of\nwhales that embraced acres of living bulk, and Aldrovandus of others which\nmeasured eight hundred feet in length—Rope Walks and Thames Tunnels of Whales!\nAnd even in the days of Banks and Solander, Cooke’s naturalists, we find a\nDanish member of the Academy of Sciences setting down certain Iceland Whales\n(reydan-siskur, or Wrinkled Bellies) at one hundred and twenty yards; that is,\nthree hundred and sixty feet. And Lacépède, the French naturalist, in his\nelaborate history of whales, in the very beginning of his work (page 3), sets\ndown the Right Whale at one hundred metres, three hundred and twenty-eight feet.\nAnd this work was published so late as A.D. 1825.\n\nBut will any whaleman believe these stories? No. The whale of to-day is as big\nas his ancestors in Pliny’s time. And if ever I go where Pliny is, I, a whaleman\n(more than he was), will make bold to tell him so. Because I cannot understand\nhow it is, that while the Egyptian mummies that were buried thousands of years\nbefore even Pliny was born, do not measure so much in their coffins as a modern\nKentuckian in his socks; and while the cattle and other animals sculptured on\nthe oldest Egyptian and Nineveh tablets, by the relative proportions in which\nthey are drawn, just as plainly prove that the high-bred, stall-fed, prize\ncattle of Smithfield, not only equal, but far exceed in magnitude the fattest of\nPharaoh’s fat kine; in the face of all this, I will not admit that of all\nanimals the whale alone should have degenerated.\n\nBut still another inquiry remains; one often agitated by the more recondite\nNantucketers. Whether owing to the almost omniscient look-outs at the mast-heads\nof the whale-ships, now penetrating even through Behring’s straits, and into the\nremotest secret drawers and lockers of the world; and the thousand harpoons and\nlances darted along all continental coasts; the moot point is, whether Leviathan\ncan long endure so wide a chase, and so remorseless a havoc; whether he must not\nat last be exterminated from the waters, and the last whale, like the last man,\nsmoke his last pipe, and then himself evaporate in the final puff.\n\nComparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo, which,\nnot forty years ago, overspread by tens of thousands the prairies of Illinois\nand Missouri, and shook their iron manes and scowled with their thunder-clotted\nbrows upon the sites of populous river-capitals, where now the polite broker\nsells you land at a dollar an inch; in such a comparison an irresistible\nargument would seem furnished, to show that the hunted whale cannot now escape\nspeedy extinction.\n\nBut you must look at this matter in every light. Though so short a period\nago—not a good lifetime—the census of the buffalo in Illinois exceeded the\ncensus of men now in London, and though at the present day not one horn or hoof\nof them remains in all that region; and though the cause of this wondrous\nextermination was the spear of man; yet the far different nature of the\nwhale-hunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious an end to the Leviathan. Forty men\nin one ship hunting the Sperm Whales for forty-eight months think they have done\nextremely well, and thank God, if at last they carry home the oil of forty fish.\nWhereas, in the days of the old Canadian and Indian hunters and trappers of the\nWest, when the far west (in whose sunset suns still rise) was a wilderness and a\nvirgin, the same number of moccasined men, for the same number of months,\nmounted on horse instead of sailing in ships, would have slain not forty, but\nforty thousand and more buffaloes; a fact that, if need were, could be\nstatistically stated.\n\nNor, considered aright, does it seem any argument in favour of the gradual\nextinction of the Sperm Whale, for example, that in former years (the latter\npart of the last century, say) these Leviathans, in small pods, were encountered\nmuch oftener than at present, and, in consequence, the voyages were not so\nprolonged, and were also much more remunerative. Because, as has been elsewhere\nnoticed, those whales, influenced by some views to safety, now swim the seas in\nimmense caravans, so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries, yokes, and\npods, and schools of other days are now aggregated into vast but widely\nseparated, unfrequent armies. That is all. And equally fallacious seems the\nconceit, that because the so-called whale-bone whales no longer haunt many\ngrounds in former years abounding with them, hence that species also is\ndeclining. For they are only being driven from promontory to cape; and if one\ncoast is no longer enlivened with their jets, then, be sure, some other and\nremoter strand has been very recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle.\n\nFurthermore: concerning these last mentioned Leviathans, they have two firm\nfortresses, which, in all human probability, will for ever remain impregnable.\nAnd as upon the invasion of their valleys, the frosty Swiss have retreated to\ntheir mountains; so, hunted from the savannas and glades of the middle seas, the\nwhale-bone whales can at last resort to their Polar citadels, and diving under\nthe ultimate glassy barriers and walls there, come up among icy fields and\nfloes; and in a charmed circle of everlasting December, bid defiance to all\npursuit from man.\n\nBut as perhaps fifty of these whale-bone whales are harpooned for one cachalot,\nsome philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this positive havoc has\nalready very seriously diminished their battalions. But though for some time\npast a number of these whales, not less than 13,000, have been annually slain on\nthe nor’ west coast by the Americans alone; yet there are considerations which\nrender even this circumstance of little or no account as an opposing argument in\nthis matter.\n\nNatural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness of the\nmore enormous creatures of the globe, yet what shall we say to Harto, the\nhistorian of Goa, when he tells us that at one hunting the King of Siam took\n4,000 elephants; that in those regions elephants are numerous as droves of\ncattle in the temperate climes. And there seems no reason to doubt that if these\nelephants, which have now been hunted for thousands of years, by Semiramis, by\nPorus, by Hannibal, and by all the successive monarchs of the East—if they still\nsurvive there in great numbers, much more may the great whale outlast all\nhunting, since he has a pasture to expatiate in, which is precisely twice as\nlarge as all Asia, both Americas, Europe and Africa, New Holland, and all the\nIsles of the sea combined.\n\nMoreover: we are to consider, that from the presumed great longevity of whales,\ntheir probably attaining the age of a century and more, therefore at any one\nperiod of time, several distinct adult generations must be contemporary. And\nwhat that is, we may soon gain some idea of, by imagining all the grave-yards,\ncemeteries, and family vaults of creation yielding up the live bodies of all the\nmen, women, and children who were alive seventy-five years ago; and adding this\ncountless host to the present human population of the globe.\n\nWherefore, for all these things, we account the whale immortal in his species,\nhowever perishable in his individuality. He swam the seas before the continents\nbroke water; he once swam over the site of the Tuileries, and Windsor Castle,\nand the Kremlin. In Noah’s flood he despised Noah’s Ark; and if ever the world\nis to be again flooded, like the Netherlands, to kill off its rats, then the\neternal whale will still survive, and rearing upon the topmost crest of the\nequatorial flood, spout his frothed defiance to the skies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 106. AHAB’S LEG.\n\nThe precipitating manner in which Captain Ahab had quitted the Samuel Enderby of\nLondon, had not been unattended with some small violence to his own person. He\nhad lighted with such energy upon a thwart of his boat that his ivory leg had\nreceived a half-splintering shock. And when after gaining his own deck, and his\nown pivot-hole there, he so vehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to\nthe steersman (it was, as ever, something about his not steering inflexibly\nenough); then, the already shaken ivory received such an additional twist and\nwrench, that though it still remained entire, and to all appearances lusty, yet\nAhab did not deem it entirely trustworthy.\n\nAnd, indeed, it seemed small matter for wonder, that for all his pervading, mad\nrecklessness, Ahab did at times give careful heed to the condition of that dead\nbone upon which he partly stood. For it had not been very long prior to the\nPequod’s sailing from Nantucket, that he had been found one night lying prone\nupon the ground, and insensible; by some unknown, and seemingly inexplicable,\nunimaginable casualty, his ivory limb having been so violently displaced, that\nit had stake-wise smitten, and all but pierced his groin; nor was it without\nextreme difficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely cured.\n\nNor, at the time, had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind, that all the\nanguish of that then present suffering was but the direct issue of a former woe;\nand he too plainly seemed to see, that as the most poisonous reptile of the\nmarsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as the sweetest songster of the grove;\nso, equally with every felicity, all miserable events do naturally beget their\nlike. Yea, more than equally, thought Ahab; since both the ancestry and\nposterity of Grief go further than the ancestry and posterity of Joy. For, not\nto hint of this: that it is an inference from certain canonic teachings, that\nwhile some natural enjoyments here shall have no children born to them for the\nother world, but, on the contrary, shall be followed by the joy-childlessness of\nall hell’s despair; whereas, some guilty mortal miseries shall still fertilely\nbeget to themselves an eternally progressive progeny of griefs beyond the grave;\nnot at all to hint of this, there still seems an inequality in the deeper\nanalysis of the thing. For, thought Ahab, while even the highest earthly\nfelicities ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in them, but, at\nbottom, all heartwoes, a mystic significance, and, in some men, an archangelic\ngrandeur; so do their diligent tracings-out not belie the obvious deduction. To\ntrail the genealogies of these high mortal miseries, carries us at last among\nthe sourceless primogenitures of the gods; so that, in the face of all the glad,\nhay-making suns, and soft cymballing, round harvest-moons, we must needs give in\nto this: that the gods themselves are not for ever glad. The ineffaceable, sad\nbirth-mark in the brow of man, is but the stamp of sorrow in the signers.\n\nUnwittingly here a secret has been divulged, which perhaps might more properly,\nin set way, have been disclosed before. With many other particulars concerning\nAhab, always had it remained a mystery to some, why it was, that for a certain\nperiod, both before and after the sailing of the Pequod, he had hidden himself\naway with such Grand-Lama-like exclusiveness; and, for that one interval, sought\nspeechless refuge, as it were, among the marble senate of the dead. Captain\nPeleg’s bruited reason for this thing appeared by no means adequate; though,\nindeed, as touching all Ahab’s deeper part, every revelation partook more of\nsignificant darkness than of explanatory light. But, in the end, it all came\nout; this one matter did, at least. That direful mishap was at the bottom of his\ntemporary recluseness. And not only this, but to that ever-contracting, dropping\ncircle ashore, who, for any reason, possessed the privilege of a less banned\napproach to him; to that timid circle the above hinted casualty—remaining, as it\ndid, moodily unaccounted for by Ahab—invested itself with terrors, not entirely\nunderived from the land of spirits and of wails. So that, through their zeal for\nhim, they had all conspired, so far as in them lay, to muffle up the knowledge\nof this thing from others; and hence it was, that not till a considerable\ninterval had elapsed, did it transpire upon the Pequod’s decks.\n\nBut be all this as it may; let the unseen, ambiguous synod in the air, or the\nvindictive princes and potentates of fire, have to do or not with earthly Ahab,\nyet, in this present matter of his leg, he took plain practical procedures;—he\ncalled the carpenter.\n\nAnd when that functionary appeared before him, he bade him without delay set\nabout making a new leg, and directed the mates to see him supplied with all the\nstuds and joists of jaw-ivory (Sperm Whale) which had thus far been accumulated\non the voyage, in order that a careful selection of the stoutest,\nclearest-grained stuff might be secured. This done, the carpenter received\norders to have the leg completed that night; and to provide all the fittings for\nit, independent of those pertaining to the distrusted one in use. Moreover, the\nship’s forge was ordered to be hoisted out of its temporary idleness in the\nhold; and, to accelerate the affair, the blacksmith was commanded to proceed at\nonce to the forging of whatever iron contrivances might be needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 107. THE CARPENTER.\n\nSeat thyself sultanically among the moons of Saturn, and take high abstracted\nman alone; and he seems a wonder, a grandeur, and a woe. But from the same\npoint, take mankind in mass, and for the most part, they seem a mob of\nunnecessary duplicates, both contemporary and hereditary. But most humble though\nhe was, and far from furnishing an example of the high, humane abstraction; the\nPequod’s carpenter was no duplicate; hence, he now comes in person on this\nstage.\n\nLike all sea-going ship carpenters, and more especially those belonging to\nwhaling vessels, he was, to a certain off-handed, practical extent, alike\nexperienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his own; the\ncarpenter’s pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk of all those\nnumerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with wood as an auxiliary\nmaterial. But, besides the application to him of the generic remark above, this\ncarpenter of the Pequod was singularly efficient in those thousand nameless\nmechanical emergencies continually recurring in a large ship, upon a three or\nfour years’ voyage, in uncivilized and far-distant seas. For not to speak of his\nreadiness in ordinary duties:—repairing stove boats, sprung spars, reforming the\nshape of clumsy-bladed oars, inserting bull’s eyes in the deck, or new\ntree-nails in the side planks, and other miscellaneous matters more directly\npertaining to his special business; he was moreover unhesitatingly expert in all\nmanner of conflicting aptitudes, both useful and capricious.\n\nThe one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold, was his\nvice-bench; a long rude ponderous table furnished with several vices, of\ndifferent sizes, and both of iron and of wood. At all times except when whales\nwere alongside, this bench was securely lashed athwartships against the rear of\nthe Try-works.\n\nA belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole: the\ncarpenter claps it into one of his ever-ready vices, and straightway files it\nsmaller. A lost land-bird of strange plumage strays on board, and is made a\ncaptive: out of clean shaved rods of right-whale bone, and cross-beams of sperm\nwhale ivory, the carpenter makes a pagoda-looking cage for it. An oarsman\nsprains his wrist: the carpenter concocts a soothing lotion. Stubb longed for\nvermillion stars to be painted upon the blade of his every oar; screwing each\noar in his big vice of wood, the carpenter symmetrically supplies the\nconstellation. A sailor takes a fancy to wear shark-bone ear-rings: the\ncarpenter drills his ears. Another has the toothache: the carpenter out pincers,\nand clapping one hand upon his bench bids him be seated there; but the poor\nfellow unmanageably winces under the unconcluded operation; whirling round the\nhandle of his wooden vice, the carpenter signs him to clap his jaw in that, if\nhe would have him draw the tooth.\n\nThus, this carpenter was prepared at all points, and alike indifferent and\nwithout respect in all. Teeth he accounted bits of ivory; heads he deemed but\ntop-blocks; men themselves he lightly held for capstans. But while now upon so\nwide a field thus variously accomplished and with such liveliness of expertness\nin him, too; all this would seem to argue some uncommon vivacity of\nintelligence. But not precisely so. For nothing was this man more remarkable,\nthan for a certain impersonal stolidity as it were; impersonal, I say; for it so\nshaded off into the surrounding infinite of things, that it seemed one with the\ngeneral stolidity discernible in the whole visible world; which while\npauselessly active in uncounted modes, still eternally holds its peace, and\nignores you, though you dig foundations for cathedrals. Yet was this\nhalf-horrible stolidity in him, involving, too, as it appeared, an all-ramifying\nheartlessness;—yet was it oddly dashed at times, with an old, crutch-like,\nantediluvian, wheezing humorousness, not unstreaked now and then with a certain\ngrizzled wittiness; such as might have served to pass the time during the\nmidnight watch on the bearded forecastle of Noah’s ark. Was it that this old\ncarpenter had been a life-long wanderer, whose much rolling, to and fro, not\nonly had gathered no moss; but what is more, had rubbed off whatever small\noutward clingings might have originally pertained to him? He was a stript\nabstract; an unfractioned integral; uncompromised as a new-born babe; living\nwithout premeditated reference to this world or the next. You might almost say,\nthat this strange uncompromisedness in him involved a sort of unintelligence;\nfor in his numerous trades, he did not seem to work so much by reason or by\ninstinct, or simply because he had been tutored to it, or by any intermixture of\nall these, even or uneven; but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous\nliteral process. He was a pure manipulator; his brain, if he had ever had one,\nmust have early oozed along into the muscles of his fingers. He was like one of\nthose unreasoning but still highly useful, multum in parvo, Sheffield\ncontrivances, assuming the exterior—though a little swelled—of a common pocket\nknife; but containing, not only blades of various sizes, but also screw-drivers,\ncork-screws, tweezers, awls, pens, rulers, nail-filers, countersinkers. So, if\nhis superiors wanted to use the carpenter for a screw-driver, all they had to do\nwas to open that part of him, and the screw was fast: or if for tweezers, take\nhim up by the legs, and there they were.\n\nYet, as previously hinted, this omnitooled, open-and-shut carpenter, was, after\nall, no mere machine of an automaton. If he did not have a common soul in him,\nhe had a subtle something that somehow anomalously did its duty. What that was,\nwhether essence of quicksilver, or a few drops of hartshorn, there is no\ntelling. But there it was; and there it had abided for now some sixty years or\nmore. And this it was, this same unaccountable, cunning life-principle in him;\nthis it was, that kept him a great part of the time soliloquizing; but only like\nan unreasoning wheel, which also hummingly soliloquizes; or rather, his body was\na sentry-box and this soliloquizer on guard there, and talking all the time to\nkeep himself awake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 108. AHAB AND THE CARPENTER.\n\n\nTHE DECK—FIRST NIGHT WATCH.\n\n(Carpenter standing before his vice-bench, and by the light of two lanterns\nbusily filing the ivory joist for the leg, which joist is firmly fixed in the\nvice. Slabs of ivory, leather straps, pads, screws, and various tools of all\nsorts lying about the bench. Forward, the red flame of the forge is seen, where\nthe blacksmith is at work.)\n\nDrat the file, and drat the bone! That is hard which should be soft, and that is\nsoft which should be hard. So we go, who file old jaws and shinbones. Let’s try\nanother. Aye, now, this works better (sneezes). Halloa, this bone dust is\n(sneezes)—why it’s (sneezes)—yes it’s (sneezes)—bless my soul, it won’t let me\nspeak! This is what an old fellow gets now for working in dead lumber. Saw a\nlive tree, and you don’t get this dust; amputate a live bone, and you don’t get\nit (sneezes). Come, come, you old Smut, there, bear a hand, and let’s have that\nferule and buckle-screw; I’ll be ready for them presently. Lucky now (sneezes)\nthere’s no knee-joint to make; that might puzzle a little; but a mere\nshinbone—why it’s easy as making hop-poles; only I should like to put a good\nfinish on. Time, time; if I but only had the time, I could turn him out as neat\na leg now as ever (sneezes) scraped to a lady in a parlor. Those buckskin legs\nand calves of legs I’ve seen in shop windows wouldn’t compare at all. They soak\nwater, they do; and of course get rheumatic, and have to be doctored (sneezes)\nwith washes and lotions, just like live legs. There; before I saw it off, now, I\nmust call his old Mogulship, and see whether the length will be all right; too\nshort, if anything, I guess. Ha! that’s the heel; we are in luck; here he comes,\nor it’s somebody else, that’s certain.\n\nAHAB (advancing). (During the ensuing scene, the carpenter continues sneezing at\ntimes.)\n\nWell, manmaker!\n\nJust in time, sir. If the captain pleases, I will now mark the length. Let me\nmeasure, sir.\n\nMeasured for a leg! good. Well, it’s not the first time. About it! There; keep\nthy finger on it. This is a cogent vice thou hast here, carpenter; let me feel\nits grip once. So, so; it does pinch some.\n\nOh, sir, it will break bones—beware, beware!\n\nNo fear; I like a good grip; I like to feel something in this slippery world\nthat can hold, man. What’s Prometheus about there?—the blacksmith, I mean—what’s\nhe about?\n\nHe must be forging the buckle-screw, sir, now.\n\nRight. It’s a partnership; he supplies the muscle part. He makes a fierce red\nflame there!\n\nAye, sir; he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work.\n\nUm-m. So he must. I do deem it now a most meaning thing, that that old Greek,\nPrometheus, who made men, they say, should have been a blacksmith, and animated\nthem with fire; for what’s made in fire must properly belong to fire; and so\nhell’s probable. How the soot flies! This must be the remainder the Greek made\nthe Africans of. Carpenter, when he’s through with that buckle, tell him to\nforge a pair of steel shoulder-blades; there’s a pedlar aboard with a crushing\npack.\n\nSir?\n\nHold; while Prometheus is about it, I’ll order a complete man after a desirable\npattern. Imprimis, fifty feet high in his socks; then, chest modelled after the\nThames Tunnel; then, legs with roots to ’em, to stay in one place; then, arms\nthree feet through the wrist; no heart at all, brass forehead, and about a\nquarter of an acre of fine brains; and let me see—shall I order eyes to see\noutwards? No, but put a sky-light on top of his head to illuminate inwards.\nThere, take the order, and away.\n\nNow, what’s he speaking about, and who’s he speaking to, I should like to know?\nShall I keep standing here? (aside).\n\n’Tis but indifferent architecture to make a blind dome; here’s one. No, no, no;\nI must have a lantern.\n\nHo, ho! That’s it, hey? Here are two, sir; one will serve my turn.\n\nWhat art thou thrusting that thief-catcher into my face for, man? Thrusted light\nis worse than presented pistols.\n\nI thought, sir, that you spoke to carpenter.\n\nCarpenter? why that’s—but no;—a very tidy, and, I may say, an extremely\ngentlemanlike sort of business thou art in here, carpenter;—or would’st thou\nrather work in clay?\n\nSir?—Clay? clay, sir? That’s mud; we leave clay to ditchers, sir.\n\nThe fellow’s impious! What art thou sneezing about?\n\nBone is rather dusty, sir.\n\nTake the hint, then; and when thou art dead, never bury thyself under living\npeople’s noses.\n\nSir?—oh! ah!—I guess so;—yes—oh, dear!\n\nLook ye, carpenter, I dare say thou callest thyself a right good workmanlike\nworkman, eh? Well, then, will it speak thoroughly well for thy work, if, when I\ncome to mount this leg thou makest, I shall nevertheless feel another leg in the\nsame identical place with it; that is, carpenter, my old lost leg; the flesh and\nblood one, I mean. Canst thou not drive that old Adam away?\n\nTruly, sir, I begin to understand somewhat now. Yes, I have heard something\ncurious on that score, sir; how that a dismasted man never entirely loses the\nfeeling of his old spar, but it will be still pricking him at times. May I\nhumbly ask if it be really so, sir?\n\nIt is, man. Look, put thy live leg here in the place where mine once was; so,\nnow, here is only one distinct leg to the eye, yet two to the soul. Where thou\nfeelest tingling life; there, exactly there, there to a hair, do I. Is’t a\nriddle?\n\nI should humbly call it a poser, sir.\n\nHist, then. How dost thou know that some entire, living, thinking thing may not\nbe invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing precisely where thou now\nstandest; aye, and standing there in thy spite? In thy most solitary hours,\nthen, dost thou not fear eavesdroppers? Hold, don’t speak! And if I still feel\nthe smart of my crushed leg, though it be now so long dissolved; then, why mayst\nnot thou, carpenter, feel the fiery pains of hell for ever, and without a body?\nHah!\n\nGood Lord! Truly, sir, if it comes to that, I must calculate over again; I think\nI didn’t carry a small figure, sir.\n\nLook ye, pudding-heads should never grant premises.—How long before the leg is\ndone?\n\nPerhaps an hour, sir.\n\nBungle away at it then, and bring it to me (turns to go). Oh, Life! Here I am,\nproud as Greek god, and yet standing debtor to this blockhead for a bone to\nstand on! Cursed be that mortal inter-indebtedness which will not do away with\nledgers. I would be free as air; and I’m down in the whole world’s books. I am\nso rich, I could have given bid for bid with the wealthiest Prætorians at the\nauction of the Roman empire (which was the world’s); and yet I owe for the flesh\nin the tongue I brag with. By heavens! I’ll get a crucible, and into it, and\ndissolve myself down to one small, compendious vertebra. So.\n\nCARPENTER (resuming his work).\n\nWell, well, well! Stubb knows him best of all, and Stubb always says he’s queer;\nsays nothing but that one sufficient little word queer; he’s queer, says Stubb;\nhe’s queer—queer, queer; and keeps dinning it into Mr. Starbuck all the\ntime—queer—sir—queer, queer, very queer. And here’s his leg! Yes, now that I\nthink of it, here’s his bedfellow! has a stick of whale’s jaw-bone for a wife!\nAnd this is his leg; he’ll stand on this. What was that now about one leg\nstanding in three places, and all three places standing in one hell—how was\nthat? Oh! I don’t wonder he looked so scornful at me! I’m a sort of\nstrange-thoughted sometimes, they say; but that’s only haphazard-like. Then, a\nshort, little old body like me, should never undertake to wade out into deep\nwaters with tall, heron-built captains; the water chucks you under the chin\npretty quick, and there’s a great cry for life-boats. And here’s the heron’s\nleg! long and slim, sure enough! Now, for most folks one pair of legs lasts a\nlifetime, and that must be because they use them mercifully, as a tender-hearted\nold lady uses her roly-poly old coach-horses. But Ahab; oh he’s a hard driver.\nLook, driven one leg to death, and spavined the other for life, and now wears\nout bone legs by the cord. Halloa, there, you Smut! bear a hand there with those\nscrews, and let’s finish it before the resurrection fellow comes a-calling with\nhis horn for all legs, true or false, as brewery-men go round collecting old\nbeer barrels, to fill ’em up again. What a leg this is! It looks like a real\nlive leg, filed down to nothing but the core; he’ll be standing on this\nto-morrow; he’ll be taking altitudes on it. Halloa! I almost forgot the little\noval slate, smoothed ivory, where he figures up the latitude.
